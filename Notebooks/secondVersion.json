{"Ionia": {"Kolophon": "Identifier: 853. , (Kolophonios) Map  61.  Lat. 38.05,long. 27.10.  Size  of  territory:  unknown but,  including  Notion  (no. 858),  at  least  4.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is  (IG i\u00b3  37.9 (c. 425)  (cf.  infra);  PEP  Kolophon 5.35  ( 311\u00ad306))  either  (Mimnermos  fr. 9,  West)  or  (Strabo  14.1.28).  The  city- ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  266.i.10;Xen.  Hell. 1.2.3)  or (IG i\u00b3  261.v.10).  The  mercenary's  signature from  Abu  Simbel  has  (ML 7f(591)).  In  C 5 Kolophon  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  in  Thuc. 3.34.1, ionia  1077 2,  and  in  the  political  sense  in  Hdt. 1.141.4,  142.3\u00ad4,  143.3.In C 4  it  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  in  PEP  Kolophon 6.i.9, 19  ( 311\u00ad306)),and  in  the  political  sense  in  PEP  Kolophon 4.29, 82,  86  ( 311\u00ad306).  The  polis  cognate  polites  is  used  in  PEP Kolophon 1.5,  6.28  ( 311\u00ad306).  A  was included  among  the  158  Aristotelian  constitutions  (fr. 520.1\u00ad2).  The  verb  is  found  in  Thuc. 3.34.2.  Hdt. 1.14.4  applies  the  word  asty  to  the  urban  centre of  Kolophon. The  word patris  is  used  of  Kolophon  in  Hdt. 1.150.1  and  SEG 35  1125.3  (c. 300).The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attest- ed  internally  in  PEP  Kolophon 6.9  ( 311\u00ad306)  and  on  C 5  coins (infra)  and  externally  in  Hdt  1.147.2;  Thuc. 3.34.1;Xen.  Hell. 1.2.3;  PEP  Kolophon 16  (a  C 4  inscription  found  in  Byzantion, perhaps  commemorating  a  public  slave  of  Kolophon).  The individual  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in ML 7f(591);  Pind.  fr. 188,Bergk;  IG i\u00b3  65.9  ( 427/6)  and  1347 (C 5  tombstone  set  up  at  Athens). The  name  of  the  territory  is (SEG 28 697.10  Iscr.Cos  ED 174).  This  text  may  relate  to  an  arbitra- tion  between  Teos  (no. 868)  and  Klazomenai  (Ager  ( 1991)); and  if  Ager's  interpretation  is  accepted,  this  inscription shows  that  Kolophonian  territory  bordered  on  the  territ- ories  of  Teos  and  Klazomenai  (no. 847)  in  the  west  (see also  Ager  ( 1996)  67\u00ad69  no. 15).  The  northern  and  eastern boundaries  of  Kolophonian  territory  in  the  Archaic and  Classical  periods  are  unknown.  In  PEP  Kolophon 6  (C 4)  the  territory  (chora)  and  urban  centre  (polis)are mentioned.  The  territory  of  Kolophon  contained  Klaros with  its  Apollo  sanctuary  and  the  harbour  town  Notion (Thuc. 3.34.1: );  see  Notion  (no. 858). The  history  of  Kolophon  begins  c. 700  with  a  stasis between  two  factions.  One  of  the  factions  emigrated  to Smyrna,  then  an  Aiolian  city,  but  subsequently  the Kolophonians  expelled  the  Smyrnaians  and  had  Smyrna turned  into  an  Ionian  city  (Hdt. 1.16.2,  150.1\u00ad2;see Smyrna (no. 867)).C.660  Kolophon  was  conquered  by Gyges  of  Lydia (Hdt. 1.14.4).According  to  Arist.  fr. 601  and  Timaios  (FGrHist 556)  fr. 56,  Siris  (no. 69)  in  southern  Italy  was  founded  by colonists  from  Kolophon,  and  a  combination  of  the  sources has  led  to  the  view  that  these  colonists  left  Kolophon  because of  Gyges'  conquest  (Demand  ( 1990)  31\u00ad33;  supra 293). Theognidea 1103,West,suggests  that  Kolophon  was  destroyed in  a  way  similar  to  Smyrna  (no. 867)  and  Magnesia  (no. 852). It  is  uncertain  whether  the  destruction  of  Kolophon  was connected  with  Gyges'  conquest  or  should  rather  be  con- nected,  e.g.,  with  the  story  that  Alyattes  of  Lydia  had  all  the Kolophonian  knights  killed  (Polyaen. 7.2.2).  Kolophon belonged  to  the  Ionian  dodekapolis  (Hdt. 1.142.3)  and  must have  been  under  Persian  rule  from  the  540s. In C 5  Kolophon  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Ionian  district  and  is  recorded  from  454/3 (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.21)  to  416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.40)  a  total  of  sixteen times,  four  times  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of first 3  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.21),  reduced  to  1\u0153  tal.  in  446/5  (IG i\u00b3 266.i.10),  raised  to  3  tal.  in  432/1  (IG i\u00b3  280.i.38)  and  reduced to 500  dr.  in  428/7  (IG i\u00b3  283.iii.24).  It  was  assessed  for  trib- ute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.135). In 430  Kolophon  was  conquered  by the  Persians  in  conse- quence  of  a  stasis  between  the  citizens.  The  Kolophonians living  in  the  city  fled and settled in N otion  (no. 858).The  sta- sis  flared up again,  and  the  city  of  Notion  was  divided  into two  sections  separated  by  a  wall.  One  part,  described  as  a  tei- chos,  was  inhabited  by Medising  Kolophonians  and  Notieis who  now  united  and  formed  a  political  community.  The other  part  of  the  city  was  inhabited  by  the  opposite  faction of  Kolophonian  immigrants  (and,  undoubtedly,  some Notieis).  In  427  they  invited  an  Athenian  squadron  under Paches.  The  Athenians  conquered  the  teichos,  expelled  the Medising  Kolophonians,  gave  Notion  to  the  other Kolophonians,  and  later  sent  a  contingent  of  Athenian colonists  supplemented  with  Kolophonians  from  all  poleis (Thuc. 3.34.1\u00ad4).  This  incident  is  reflected in the A thenian tribute  lists,  where  the  phoros  paid  by  Kolophon  is  reduced from  3  tal.  in  432/1  to 500  dr.  paid  in  428/7  and  the  following years  down to 416/15  (supra).  For  corresponding  variations in  Notion's  payments,  see  infra 1089.  An  undated  C 5  treaty between  Athens  and  Kolophon  with  Kolophon  as  a  sub- ordinate  party (IG i\u00b3  37,  cf. 42\u00ad43)  must  belong  in  this  con- text  too,  since  it  regulates  the  relations  between  the Kolophonians  and  the  Athenian  colonists  (ll. 20,  23,  42).  In the  following  period  Notion  and  Kolophon  are  both  listed side  by  side  as  members  of  the  Delian  League,  viz.in 428/7 (IG i\u00b3  283.iii.23\u00ad24),  421/0  (IG i\u00b3  285.i.40\u00ad41)  and  416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.40\u00ad41).  Thus,  both  persisted  as  separate  political communities,  but  inland  Kolophon  was  still  in  Persian hands  and  was  not  reconquered  by  the  Athenians  until  409 (Xen.  Hell. 1.2.4).  It  is  unknown  whether,  from  427  to 409, the  communities  of  the  Kolophonians  and  Notieis  were both  centred  on  Notion,  or  whether  a  New  Kolophon-at-Sea was  founded,  a  community  that  remained  distinct  from  the community  of  the  Notieis  who  occupied  the  harbour  of Notion;  see  Pi\u00e9rart  ( 1984)  168\u00ad71,  pointing  out  that  the Kolophon  mentioned  in  IG i\u00b3  37.9  is  probably  the  New Kolophon,  inhabited  by the  Kolophonians  and  the  Athenian colonists.  Following  Mattingly  ( 1966)  210\u00ad12  ( 1996) 1078 rubinstein 174\u00ad78,  372\u00ad74,  Pi\u00e9rart  prefers  a  low  dating  of  IG i\u00b3  37,  42\u00ad43, contra  IG i\u00b3  pp. 40\u00ad41  followed  by  Gehrke,  Stasis 80. According  to  Arist.  Pol. 1290b14\u00ad17,  Kolophon  had  been an  oligarchy  before  their  war  against  the  Lydians;  but  the  oli- garchy  was  of  a  peculiar  kind,  in  so  far  as  those  citizens  who met  the  property  qualifications outnumbered those w ho did  not.  It  is  normally  assumed  that  Kolophon  continued  as an  oligarchy  well  into  C 5m  (Gehrke,  Stasis 80).  The  \"New Kolophon\" founded  by Athenian  colonists  and Kolophonians  in  the  420s  was  democratic  (IG i\u00b3  37.47\u00ad49; Thuc. 3.34.4).  Very little  is  known about  Kolophon's history in  C 4.Gehrke,  Stasis 81\u00ad82  assumes  that  it  had  an  oligarchic constitution,  introduced  after  the  King's  Peace  and  replaced with  a  democracy  by  Alexander  (PEP  Kolophon 6  ( 311\u00ad306)). Civic  subdivisions  of  Kolophon  in  the  Archaic  and Classical  periods  are  unattested  apart  from  gene,  for  which see  Robert  ( 1936)  163\u00ad64,  who  discusses  the  use  of  gene designations  in  PEP  Kolophon 6  ( 311\u00ad306). A \u00b5   is  referred  to in  the  heavily restored  inscription  IG i\u00b3  37.43  ( 447/6).  In  C 4  the  epony- mous  official of  Kolophon  was  the  (PEP  Kolophon 6).  Evidence  of  the  assembly  is  found  in  PEP  Kolophon 1  (a C 4l  probouleumatic  decree)  and  6,  with  mention  of  an    (l. 32).  The  Kolophonian  boule  is  attested in  PEP  Kolophon 1  and 6.  Officials c onnected  with  council and  assembly  are  the  \u00b5  (PEP  Kolophon 4  ( 311\u00ad306)) and  the  (PEP  Kolophon 8  (C 4\u00adC3));  see  Rhodes, DGS 357.  Other  officials attested epigraphically are the (PEP  Kolophon 6)  and  the  board  of  (PEP  Kolophon 4).  For  a  Kolophonian  embassy,  see  IG ii\u00b2 456.22\u00ad28  ( 307/6).  In  C 4l  the  Kolophonians  bestowed  proxe- nia  and  citizenship  on  two  citizens  of  Erythrai  (no. 845) (AJP 56  ( 1935)  358\u00ad79  iv.5\u00ad6  PEP  Kolophon 1).  Kolo- phonian  theoroi  may  be  attested  in  IG i\u00b3  43.14  and 22 ( 435\u00ad427). Kolophon  controlled  ownership  of  land,  as  evidenced  in the  citizenship  decree  PEP  Kolophon 5  ( 311\u00ad306),  mention- ing      .  The  same  decree  contains evidence  for  liturgies  and  eisphora,  also  levied  on  metics  (ll. 12\u00ad15).  The  verb  \u00b5  is  used  in  ll. 10\u00ad11.  Other  evid- ence  for  free  non-citizens  resident  in  Kolophon  is  provided by PEP  Kolophon 6  ( 311\u00ad306),  in  which  responsibility  is placed  on  ten  commissioners  for  raising  funds  from  foreigners, \u00b5   .  The  list  of  individual  contrib- utors  to  the  wall-building  programme  testifies t o  a  large number  of  free  foreigners  residing  at  Kolophon,  some  regis- tered  with  their  city-ethnic  (Abderites,  etc.)  or  other  ethnic (Makedon,  etc.)  (see  also  Robert  ( 1936)  162  n. 2),  some  just called  metoikoi  ( 372\u00ad73,  etc.),  perhaps  manumitted  slaves who  were  perceived  differently  from  those  immigrants  who insisted  on  keeping  their  original  civic  identity. The  cult  of  Athena  Polias  is  attested  in  PEP  Kolophon 6. Public  festivals  are  attested  in  PEP  Kolophon 1  (C 4l),  in which  the  honorands  receive  the  privilege  of        .  For  the  Kolophonian  calendar,  see  Tr\u00fcmpy, Monat. 99\u00ad100  \u00a7 86. Hermesianax  of  Kolophon  was  a  victor  in  the  Olympic Games  in  320  (SEG 35  1125.3  with  Paus. 6.17.4 Olympionikai  no. 475.).  A  Kolophonian  victor  in  the Oropian  Games  is  attested  for  C 4  (probably  between  366 and 338)  in  IG vii.414.16.  IG ii\u00b2  456  b. 4\u00ad8  records  a  dedica- tion  of  a  wreath  to  Athena  by  the  demos  of  Kolophon ( 307/6). The  remains  of  Kolophon  excavated  by  Holland  and  pub- lished  in  1944  are  not  easy  to  interpret;  see  Hoepfner  and Osthues  in  Hoepfner  et al.( 1999)  280\u00ad91.C.311\u00ad306  the  \"old\" Kolophon  was  merged  with  a  new  and  larger  urban  centre (PEP  Kolophon 6).  It  appears  that,  in  connection  with  the joining  together  of  the  two  urban  centres,  the  buildings  in the  old  centre  were  to  be  either  privatised  or  demolished along  with  the  old  agora  (l. 26).  It  may  be  inferred  from  the participle  (l. 14)  that  the  old  city  was  located  at a  lower  level  than  the  C 4  settlement;  but  its  precise  location cannot  be  determined.  Holland  found  evidence  for  C 7 structures  close  to  a  C 4  stoa  and  another  structure,  also  C 4, which  he  interpreted  as  the  Metroon.  The  Metroon  is  also attested  epigraphically  (PEP  Kolophon 5).  Miller  ( 1978) 109\u00ad12,  127\u00ad28  classifies the building as a prytaneion  annex. Hoepfner  and  Osthues  (in  Hoepfner  et al.( 1999))  conclude that  the  Archaic  city  must  have  been  located  on  the  slope  of the  acropolis,  pace  e.g.  Migeotte  ( 1992)  217,  who  follows Holland's  ( 1944)  suggestion  that  the  old  city  was  located  in the  plain  to  the  north-east  of  the  acropolis.  In  PEP  Kolophon 6  temples  in  the  old  city  are  referred  to  generally,  and  in 16\u00ad18  there  is  specific r eference  to altars  for  Zeus  Soter, Poseidon  Asphaleios,  Apollo  Klarios,  Meter  Antaie,  Athena Polias  and  \"the  other  gods  and  heroes\". PEP  Kolophon 6  concerns  a  great  project  of  fortification which  served  in  part  to  reunite  the  site  of  current  habitation with  the  old  (and  apparently  abandoned)  urban  centre  of Kolophon  (Migeotte  ( 1992)  214\u00ad23  no. 69).Some  fortificato- ry  structures  were  clearly  already  in  existence  ( 22\u00ad23);  but  it is  not  clear  if  these  fortifications enclosed the old or the new settlement;  see  de  la  Geni\u00e8re  ( 1994).  The  circuit  of  \"New\" Kolophon  encloses  an  area  of 80  ha  (Hoepfner  et al.( 1999) 284). ionia  1079 Urbanisation  may  have  taken  place  quite  early  at Kolophon:  Hdt. 1.15.1  refers  to Gyges'  conquest  of  the  asty  of Kolophon  in  C 7.  Remains  of  an  early  Archaic  settlement (C 7)  have  been  found  on  the  slope  of  the  acropolis  (Holland ( 1944)). Kolophon  struck  coins  of  silver  and  bronze  from  C 6l throughout  C 5  and  C 4.  The  earliest  silver  types:  ( 1) c. 525\u00ad490  on  the  Persian  standard:  denominations: hemiobol,  trihemitetartemorion,  tetartemorion:  obv.  head of  Apollo  facing;  rev.  incuse  square;  legend: ,  ,   indicating  denomination.  ( 2)  C 5  on  the  Persian  standard: denominations:  drachm,  trihemiobol,  quarterobol:  obv. Artemis  laureate,  or  Apollo  laureate;  legend: or or ;  rev.  lyre  within incuse  square;  legend  sometimes  on  rev.  Silver  and  bronze, c. 389\u00ad330  on  the  Rhodian  standard:  denominations: tetradrachm,  drachm,  hemidrachm,  diobol  and  fractions  in  bronze:  obv.  head  of  Apollo  laureate;  rev.  lyre,  or  tripod; legend: or or and magistrate's  name  (Head,  HN \u00b2569\u00ad70;  BMC  Ionia 36\u00ad40; SNG  Cop.  Ionia 133\u00ad48). For  the  Kolophonian  foundation  of  Siris  (no. 69)  in southern  Italy,  see  supra 1078. 849.Korykos  (Korykaios)  Map 56.  Lat. 38.10,long.  26.35. Size  of  territory:  unknown  but  probably 1  or 2.  Type:  C.  The toponym ,  (Thuc. 8.14.1,  33.2,  34)  designates  pri- marily  the  mountain  in  the  southern  part  of  the  territory  of Erythrai  (no. 845)  (Thuc. 8.33.2;  Hecat.  fr. 231)  but  also  a homonymous  community,  described  by  Ephor.  fr. 27  as  a polismation  (Barr.  records  the  mountain  but  not  the  settle- ment).  The  city-ethnic  is (Ephor.  fr. 27;Strabo 14.1.32).  Korykos  was  located  in  Erythraian  territory  (Thuc. 8.33.2),  and  it  had  another  small  community,  Myonnesos (no. 855),  as  its  neighbour  (Ephor.  fr. 27).  On  the  coast  along the  foot  of  the  mountain  were  a  row  of  small  harbours, which  were  all  nests  of  pirates  (Ephor.  fr. 27;Strabo  14.1.32). Korykos  seems  to  have  been  one  of  them.  The  collective  use of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  an  external  context  in  Ephor. fr. 27  and  in  a  proverb  quoted  by  Strabo 14.1.32.A  controver- sy  surrounds  some  Imperial  coins  which  may  or  may  not have  been  minted  by  this  community  (see  Imhoof-Blumer ( 1902)  463  versus  von  Aulock  ( 1968)  versus  Robert  ( 1981)  352 n. 42). 850.Lebedos  (Lebedios) Map  61.  Lat. 38.05,long.  27.00. Size of  territory:  probably 2  or 3.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is ,  (Thuc. 8.19.4;Strabo 14.1.29).  The  city-ethnic  is (Michel  484.2\u00ad3  (C 4l)).  Lebedos  is  attested  as  a polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Hdt. 1.142.3)  and  in  the  politi- cal  sense  (Hdt. 1.141.4,  142.3,  143.3;Tod 113.26,  39  ( 391\u00ad388); Syll. \u00b3344.19  (c. 303)).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  internally  on  C 2  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2  580)  and  exter- nally  in  IG i\u00b3  71.i.138,  263.ii.6,  266.i.13;Tod 113.26  ( 391\u00ad388); Syll. \u00b3344.6  (c. 303).  Lebedos  belonged  to  the  Ionian dodekapolis  (Hdt. 1.142.3),  and  its  representatives  participat- ed  in  the  C 4  arbitration  between  Miletos  (no. 854)  and Myous  (no. 856)  (Tod  113.26).  It  is  also  clear  from  Michel  484 that  in  C 4l  the  Lebedians  were  part  of  the  Ionian  associa- tion,  presumably  with  representatives  in  the  common Ionian  boule. Lebedos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Ionian  district  and  is  recorded  from  451/50  (IG i\u00b3 262.ii.32)  to  430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.i.42,  mostly  restored)  a  total  of eleven  times,  four  times  completely  restored,  paying  a phoros  of 3  tal.  down to,  probably, 447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.i.33)  and thereafter  1  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  266.i.13).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.138).  It  revolted  in  411  (Thuc. 8.19.4). The  most  important  evidence  for  Lebedos  is  Syll. \u00b3344, which  contains  Antigonos  I's  instructions  concerning  the synoecism  of  Lebedos  (c. 303).  The  decree  is  difficult t o  use retrospectively,  but  it  can  be  inferred  from  l. 21  that  Lebedos had  issued  grants  of  proxenia.  Theorodokoi  of  Lebedos  to host  theoroi  from  Argos  (no. 347)  are  attested  in  SEG 23 189.ii.6  ( 330\u00ad324). Michel 484.1\u00ad9  refers  to a  lawsuit  concerning  the  priest- hood  of  Zeus  Boulaios  and  Hera,  in  which  the  Lebedians were  involved.  It  is  possibly  an  inter-polis  dispute  over  a common  Ionian  priesthood. In  Antigonos  I's  instructions  on  the  proposed  synoecism of  Teos  and  Lebedos,  Syll. \u00b3344.24\u00ad26  (c. 303),  it  is  assumed that  symbolaia  exist  between  the  two  cities,  and  that  each  of them  has  its  own  laws. The  eponymous  office of mentioned  in  Michel 484.1  and 10  may  have  pertained  to  Lebedos,  as  argued  by Magnetto ( 1997)  63,  rather  than  to  Priene  (no. 861),  as  has normally  been  assumed. The  walls  of  Lebedos  were  described  by  G.  Weber  ( 1904) 229,  who  did  not  attempt  to  date  the  fortification.  It  is  pre- sumably  Hellenistic. 851.Leukophrys  Map 61.

Location  before  399 unknown,  after  399:  lat. 37.50,long.  27.30.  Size  of  territory:  ? Type:  A.  The  toponym  is  ,  (Hdt. 1.161,  3.122.1, 125.2)  or  (Thuc. 1.138.5,  8.50.3).  The city-ethnic  is  (IG xii.635.3  (C 4l);  cf.  Shipley  ( 1987) 163),  to  which  Hdt. 3.90.1  adds     .  In  C 4 Magnesia  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Ps.-Skylax 98:  `;  cf.  also  Diod. 14.36.3  (r 400))  and  in  the political  sense  (SEG 14  459.7  (C 4l/C3e)).  The  collective use of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  both  externally  (Archil.  fr. 20, West;  Theognidea 603,  1103,  West)  and  internally  on  C 4m coins  (infra)  and  in  inscriptions  (I.Magnesia 2.13  (C 4l)).The individual  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in IG xii.635.3  (C 4l)  and  CEG ii  855  (C 4l/C3e),  which  also  uses patris  about  the  community. In  Hdt. 3.90.1,  the  Magnesians  of  Asia  are  mentioned alongside  the  Ionians  and  Aiolians,  and  they  seem  to  have been  regarded  as  a  group  apart.  According  to  SEG 14  459.7\u00ad9 (  CEG  II 855  (C 4l/C3e)),  Magnesia  was  founded  from Thessaly.  Presumably  in  C 7,  Magnesia  waged  war  against Ephesos  (no. 844)  (Kallinos  fr. 3,  West).  A  physical  destruc- tion  of  Magnesia  by  the  Kimmerians  in  C 7  is  related  by Strabo  14.1.39\u00ad40,  who  cites  Archilochos  (fr. 20,  West)  as corroboration.  He  also  claims  that  Miletos  (no. 854) annexed  the  site,  but  it  is  not  known  for  how  long  the Milesians  were  left  in  control.  Hdt. 1.161  shows  that  the  city had  been  rebuilt  by  547/6,when  it  was  plundered  by Mazares and  subjected  to  Persia. The  city  remained  under  Persian  control  even  after  the  establishment  of  the  Delian  League:  the  Persian  king granted  tax-levying  rights  at  Magnesia  to  Themistokles  dur- ing  the  latter's  exile  (Thuc. 1.138.5).  When  Astyochos approached  Tissaphernes  in  connection  with  Alkibiades' intrigues  in  411,  Tissaphernes  was  apparently  based  in Magnesia  (Thuc. 8.50.3).  The  city  was  under  the  control  of Tissaphernes  in  400  when  it  was  captured  by  Thibron. When  Thibron  failed  to  take  Tralleis,  he  returned  to Magnesia,  and  because  the  city  was  unfortified,  he  decided to  relocate  it  to  a  mountain  nearby  called  Thorax  (Diod. 14.36.2\u00ad4). Very  little  is  known  about  the  constitution  of  Magnesia. The  Aristotelian  collection  of  constitutions  included  a Magneton  politeia  (Heracl.  Lemb. 50;  Arist.  no. 106),  and  at Pol. 1289b38\u00ad40  Aristotle  mentions  the  importance  of  the cavalry  of  Archaic  Magnesia  as  an  illustration  of  his  claim that  communities  dependent  on  such  forces  tended  to  have an  oligarchic  constitution.  But  Magnesia  was  evidently  a democracy  in  late  C 4  (I.Magnesia 1  and 2). I.Magnesia 1  (C 4)  and 2  (C 4l)  are  both  public  enact- ments  passed  by  the  Magnesian  assembly  ( 2.8\u00ad9:  \u00b5).  The  eponymous  official  of Magnesia  in  C 4l  was  the ( 2.2\u00ad3).  The  Magnesian boule  is  attested  in  I.Magnesia 2.8  (cited  supra)ina probouleutic  capacity.  A  grammateus  (of  the  boule?)  is attested  in 2.7.  A  Magnesian  theorodokos  to  host  theoroi from  Argos  (no. 347)  is  attested  in  SEG 23  189.ii.11 ( 330\u00ad324).  The  months (I.Magnesia 1.3)  and (I.Magnesia 2.3)areattestedforC4.  Both  are untypical  of  Ionian  calendars  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 110\u00ad11  \u00a7 94). A  Magnesian  victor  in  the  Olympic  Games  is  attested  in  C 5l (Olympionikai 329),  another  in 344  (Olympionikai 449), and  one  in  the  Pythian  Games  is  attested  in  C 4\u00adC3  (SEG 14 459). The  citizen  body  of  Magnesia  was  subdivided  into  phylai in  C 4  (I.Magnesia 2.4).  The  names  of  five phylai  are  attested in  inscriptions  of  C 3f(I.Magnesia  2,5,6,9,11),and  all  five are named  after  the  Olympian  gods  (Ares,  Aphrodite,  Hermes, Hestia  and  Zeus).  Thus,  Magnesia  may  already  in  the Classical  period  have  had  all  twelve  phylai  named  after  the twelve  Olympian  gods  (Jones,  POAG 315\u00ad17).  Proxenia  and probably  also  citizenship  were given  to the  Makedonian Apollophanes  (I.Magnesia 2  (C 4l)).  A  grant  of  enktesis  is given  in  I.Magnesia 2.15,  and  Magnesian  tax-levying  powers may  be  inferred  from  the  grant  of  ateleia  in  I.Magnesia 2.15\u00ad16.  Resident  free  non-citizens  are  attested  in  the  C 4 funerary  monuments  I.Magnesia 258  ( ) and 259 ( \u00b5). The  agora  of  C 5  Magnesia  is  attested  in  Thuc. 1.138.5.The sanctuary  of  Artemis  Leukophryene  (Xen.  Hell. 3.2.19)  pre- sumably  lay  within  the  urban  centre  of  the  relocated Magnesia  (supra).  Foundations  dating  back  to  C 6e  have been  discovered  beneath  the  Hellenistic  Artemision. The  earliest  attested  coinage  is  a  C 5m  silver  didrachm  on the  Attic  standard  bearing  the  name  Themistokles  (BMC Ionia 158).  Types:  obv.

The  toponym  is  ,  (I.Priene 1  Tod 185.2  ( 334);  SEG 23  189.ii.10  ( 330\u00ad324)).A  city-ethnic  may  be attested  in  abbreviated  form  on  the  C 4  coins  ( ,  infra). Naulochon  is  probably  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  in I.Priene 1.6  (van  Berchem  ( 1970)  200\u00ad1;  Hornblower  ( 1982a) 327);  but  the  interpretation  of  this  inscription  is  open  to debate  (Heisserer  ( 1980)  162).Likewise,the  dedication  to  the hero  Naulochos  as  \"protector  of  the  polis\"(  in  CEG ii  854.5  I.Priene 196  (C 4m))  may  be  an attestation  of  Naulochon  (and  not  Priene  (no. 861))  as  a  polis in  the  political  sense. Naulochon  was  the  port  of  Priene  and  seems  to  have existed  as  a  separate  community  during  part  of  C 4. However,  the  edict  of  Alexander  the  Great  seems  to  equate the  Greek  inhabitants  of  Naulochon  with  the  , suggesting  that  there  was  no  separate  Naulochean  commu- nal  identity.  Depending  on  how  the  text  is  restored,  the decree  may  also  be  interpreted  to  the  effect  that  some  of  the inhabitants  were  not  Greek  at  all  (Heisserer  ( 1980)  156; Botermann  ( 1994)).If  it  is  accepted  that  Priene  had  ceased  to exist  at  some  point  after  391/0,  to  be  revived  as  a  community only  after  the  refoundation  of  the  city,  then  Naulochon  may have  served  as  a  temporary  urban  and  political  centre  of  the Prienians  (van  Berchem  ( 1970)  200\u00ad1;  Hornblower  ( 1982a) 327).  However,  the  numismatic  evidence  points  to  Prienian coins  having  been  minted  simultaneously  with  coins  mint- ed  by  Naulochon,  a  problem  not  solved  satisfactorily  by  van Berchem's  argument.  Theorodokoi  to  host  theoroi  from Argos  (no. 347)  are  attested  for  Naulochon  in  SEG 23 189.ii.10  ( 330\u00ad324). Naulochon  struck  bronze  coins  in  C 4m.

Type:  A.  The  toponym  is  ,   (Hecat.  fr. 233;  Thuc. 3.34.1;Xen.  Hell. 1.5.12\u00ad14;  Hell.  Oxy. 8.4,  Chambers;  Ps.-Skylax  98).  The  city-ethnic  is   (IG i\u00b3  261.v.11  ( 452/1)).  Notion  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban sense,  explicitly  at  Hell.  Oxy. 8.4,  unless  the  reference  is  to Kolophon  (no. 848)  (see  Bruce  ( 1967)  44),  and  implicitly  at Ps.-Skylax 98:   \u00b5  (see  Flensted-Jensen  and Hansen  ( 1996)  142.At  Arist.  Pol. 1303b7\u00ad10  Notion  is  listed  as an  example  of  a  community  which  was  sometimes  a  sepa- rate polis.  The  collective  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  in  Attic  inscriptions  (the  tribute  lists  and  IG ii\u00b2 1.48  Tod 97  ( 403/2)). Although  it  cannot  be  ruled  out  completely  that  Notion in  Ionia  was  in  fact  identical  with  the  Aiolic  Notion (\"Southern\")  mentioned  in  Hdt. 1.149.1,its  history  was  inex- tricably  bound  up  with  that  of  Kolophon  (no. 848),  for which  it  served  as  a  harbour  town.  Thus,  the  preferable  view is  that  Aiolic  and  Ionian  Notion  were  different  communi- ties. Notion  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Ionian  district  and  is  recorded  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3 259.iii.22)  to  416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.41)  a  total  of  eighteen  times, four  times  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 2,000  dr. in  all  years,  except  in  428/7  when  it  paid  only  100  dr.  (IG i\u00b3 283.iii.23).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.107, toponym  mostly  restored).  It  is  recorded  once  by  toponym (IG i\u00b3  285.i.95),  and  otherwise  by  city-ethnic.  In  some  years Notion  and  Kolophon  are  listed  side  by  side  ( 454/3\u00ad452/1 and 433/2\u00ad416/15),  but  in  the  period  451/0\u00ad440/39  the  two ionia  1089 communities  are  separated  by  two  entries  (IG i\u00b3  270.i.8  and 11)  or  four  entries  (IG i\u00b3  262.iv.6  and 12)  or  five entries ( IG i\u00b3 266.i.4  and 10)  or  even  more. Thuc. 3.34.1  refers  to  Notion  in  unambiguous  terms  as  a Kolophonian  dependency  in  428/7  (    ).  But  in  the  Athenian  decree  for  the  Samians of 403/2,  the  Notieis  are  honoured  by  Athens  along  with  the people  of  Ephesos  (no. 844)  for  having  given  asylum  to Samian  refugees  (IG ii\u00b2  1.48).This  points  to  Notion  as  a  state in  its  own  right  (in  that  case  a  dependent  polis),  at  least  at  the turn  of  the  century.  Status  as  a  separate  community  is  also indicated  by  the  much  later  attestation  of  theorodokoi  in Notion,  one  to  host  theoroi  announcing  the  festival  for Argive Hera (SEG 23  189.ii.7  ( 330\u00ad324))  and  one  to  host  the- oroi  announcing  the  Nemean  Games  (SEG 36  331.ii.44\u00ad45 ( 323/2)).  Finally,  at  Pol. 1303b7\u00ad10  Aristotle  notes  that  prob- lems  with  the  nature  of  the  territory  resulted  in  stasis between  the  Kolophonians  and  the  Notieis  and  made  it  dif- ficult t o  keep  the  polis  united.  Aristotle's  use  of  ethnics  indi- cates  that  Kolophon  and  Notion  were  sometimes  united, sometimes  separate  communities.  For  the  problem  relating to  the  Athenian  foundation  of  a  New  Kolophon  at  Notion, see 1078  supra.  Even  if  New  Kolophon  was  founded  on  the actual  site  of  Notion,  the  community  of  Notieis  must  have retained  a  communal  identity  distinct  from  that  of  the Kolophonian  settlers,  as  pointed  out  by  Pi\u00e9rart  ( 1984) 168\u00ad71.  During  their  excavation  of  Notion,  Demangel  and Laumonier  ( 1923)  recorded  some  C 4  architectural  frag- ments  which  may  have  belonged  to  the  Athena  sanctuary.  A fortificatory wall ( diateichisma)  is  mentioned  in  Thuc. 3.34.2;  but  this  may  have been  only  of  a  temporary  nature. There  is  so  far  no  evidence  for  Classical  city  walls.  Recent Turkish  excavations,  reported  by  Mitchell  ( 1999)  148, produced  no  further  evidence  for  the  pre-Hellenistic  settle- ment. 859.

Pol. 1305b20\u00ad22.  The  collective use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  SEG 36  1039.5  (c. 400); I.Erythrai 6.3  ( 394);  and  externally  in  Hipponax  fr. 12,  West (C 6\u00adC5);  Hdt. 1.18.3;Dem.  8.24;  IG i\u00b3  14.4,  8,  22;  and  SEG 26 1282.11  (c. 387).  For  the  individual  and  external  use,  see  PEP Phokaia 20  (undated). The  name  of  the  territory is  ',  (Thuc. 3.29.2, 8.24.2,  33.2).  Its  size  is  likely  to have varied  considerably  over time.  In  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  five c ommunities  are entered  as  part  of  the  Erythraian  synteleia,  some  or  all  of which  may  have  been  fully  integrated  into  the  Erythraian polis  in  C 4  when  our  sources  for  them  dry  up.  But  it  is  high- ly  likely  that  they  had  been  dependent  poleis  in  their  own right  in  the  Archaic  period  and  C 5e;  see  infra.  The  settlement pattern  on  the  Mimas  peninsula  is  very  complex,  and  the communities  mentioned  in  the  tribute  quota  lists  have  not even  been  securely  located.  In C 5  Erythraia  comprised ,  probably  a  settlement  as  well  as  a  mountain (Thuc. 8.33.2)  and  the  harbour  \u00b5  (Thuc. 3.29.2). The  borders  of  Erythrai  with  the  poleis  on  the  isthmus  and perhaps  with  Chios  (no. 840)--whose  peraia  may  have included  territory  on  the  Mimas  peninsula--cannot be established  for  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods.  The  most important  evidence  concerning  the  territory  of  Erythrai  in C 4  is  I.Erythrai 151  (c. 340),  which  contains  a  list  of  roads linking  a  number  of  locations  in  the  territory  of  the  city.  The following  toponyms--all unlocated--are  listed  in  the  text: ionia  1073 (l. 1), (l. 2), (ll. 7,  11), (l. 20), (l. 21), \u00b5  (l. 22),     [] (l.26),  (l. 27),  \u00b5  (l. 40). SEG 37  917  (C 5l/C4e)  concerns  sale  of  land  and  mentions other  locations,  presumably  within  Erythraian  territory. The  locations  mentioned  are     (A 7),  (A 9,  12),    (A 16). According  to Hellan.  fr. 48,  Erythrai  was  one  of  the  poleis founded  by  Neleus,  son  of  Kodros.  Erythrai  belonged  to  the Ionian  dodekapolis  (Hdt. 1.142.4)  and  contributed  eight ships  for  the  battle  of  Lade  (Hdt. 6.8.2).  In  391\u00ad388  Erythrai sent  representatives  who  participated  as  judges  in  the  arbitration  between  Miletos  (no. 854)  and  Myous  (no. 856) (Tod 113.15). In C 5  Erythrai  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League,  from which  it  defected,  perhaps  in  the  450s,  but  see  Gehrke,  Stasis 66  n. 4.  Athens  managed  to  win  back  Erythrai  shortly  after- wards  (the  conventional  date  is  452:  the  most  important  evi- dence  for  Athens'  imposing  her  will  is  IG i\u00b3  14  ML 40  and IG i\u00b3  15,  both  mentioning  a  garrison  and  Athenian episkopoi).  Erythrai  belonged  to  the  Ionian  district  and  is recorded  as  a  paying  member  from  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.ii.13, v.13)  to  415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.i.29)  a  total  of  sixteen  times,  paying a  phoros  of  often  7  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  268.ii.27)  but  sometimes  higher amounts,  e.g. 9  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  264.iii.28)  or  12  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 283.iii.28).It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.126). In 412  Erythrai  joined  forces  with  the  Peloponnesians (Thuc. 8.14.2),  and  Erythraian  infantry  assisted  the Lakedaimonians  (Thuc. 8.16.1). Five  communities  are  recorded  in  the  Athenian  tribute lists  together  with  Erythrai  as  Erythraian  dependencies:  viz. the ,  the ',  the (- ),  the and  the  .With one possible exception (IG i\u00b3  274.iii.11,  completely  restored),  the  Erythraioi  are recorded  as  the  first of  the  six  communities,  and  the  presumption  is  that  the  five others w ere  dependencies  dominated  by  Erythrai.  In  the  years  450/49  to 447/6  the  six communities  formed  a  synteleia  (IG i\u00b3  263.ii.13\u00ad18, 264.iii.28\u00ad30,  265.i.58\u00ad64,  268.i.27\u00ad28,  268.ii.27);  from  443/2 to 438/7  they  paid  individually  ( 269.i.20\u00ad25,  270.i.22\u00ad27, 271.i.18\u00ad20,  272.ii.16\u00ad21,  273.i.32\u00adii.6,  274.iii.6\u00ad11).  In  433/2 the  tribute  was  paid  by  the  '[]   [~] (IG i\u00b3  279.i.48\u00ad49);and  in  430/29  the  five small c ommunities are  recorded  after  Erythrai  but  as  communities  belonging  to Erythrai: ',  ~ ',etc.(IG  i\u00b3 281A.19\u00ad24),  but  later  in  the  same  inscription  ( 61\u00ad66)  they are  recorded  with  their  own  ethnic  without  any  mention  of their  dependent  status.  In  later  tribute  lists  and  in  the  assess- ment  decree  of 425/4  we  meet  the  ~  (IG i\u00b3  282.iv.38, 283.iii.29,  284.ii.1),  the  '  (IG i\u00b3  284.ii.2\u00ad3, 71.ii.151),  the  (IG i\u00b3  283.iii.30,  71.i.145)  and  the (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.93),  sometimes  recorded  as  belong- ing  to  Erythrai;  yet--and no doubt accidentally--there  is  no further  reference  to the  .  Syntelies  were  usually formed  by  grouping  poleis  together  and  not  by  severing  civic subdivisions  from  a  polis  to  which  they  formerly  belonged (Schuller  ( 1974)  58\u00ad60).  Thus,  the  presumption  is  that  the five small c ommunities  listed  after  the  Erythraioi  in  the  trib- ute  lists  were  small  poleis  dependent  on  Erythrai  (see  the individual  entries). After  the  battle  of  Knidos  in 394,  Erythrai  entered  into an  alliance  with  Athens  (Diod. 14.83.3).  Diplomatic  rela- tions,  perhaps  in  the  form  of  a  treaty,  are  attested  in  IG ii\u00b2 108  ( 366/5).  I.Erythrai 9  Tod 165  (after 350)concernsan alliance  with  promise  of  mutual  military  assistance between  Erythrai  and  the  tyrant  Hermias  at  Atarneus  (ll. 15\u00ad30). The  earliest  attested  constitution  seems  to  have  been  a narrow  oligarchy  controlled  by  the  Basilidai  (Arist.  Pol. 1305b18\u00ad22),followed  by  a  moderate  democracy  or  a  moder- ate  oligarchy  in  which  eligibility  for  being  a  dikastes  was restricted  by  a  census  of  thirty  staters.  Cases  are  initiated  by a  volunteer  prosecutor  (ho  boulomenos),  introduced  by  the prytaneis,  and  heard  by  a  dikasterion  composed  of  nine  men from  each  phyle  (I.Erythrai 2A):  i.e.  twenty-seven  dikastai altogether  if  there  were  three  phylai  (infra).  No  explicit  qual- ifications are prescribed for active participation as a prose- cutor  in  public  actions.  The  decree  may  have  permitted  even those  who  were  not  full  citizens  but  children  of  freedmen  or foreigners  to act  as  prosecutors  (B. 14\u00ad24  as  interpreted  by Engelmann  and  Merkelbach  ( 1972)  28\u00ad29),  and  certain magistrates  were  presumably  selected  by  lot  ( 2B.25\u00ad32; Engelmann  and  Merkelbach  ( 1972)  29).  In,  probably, 453/2  a democratic  constitution  was  enforced  by  Athens  by  a  decree (IG i\u00b3  14)  which  stipulates  that  the  120  members  of  the  boule are  to be  selected  by lot  (ll. 8\u00ad9). Immediately  before  the  Athenians  passed  their  regula- tions  for  Erythrai,  in  response  to  the  defection  of  that  city from  the  Delian  League,  the  city  must  have  been  ruled  by  a pro-Persian,  oligarchic  faction,  perhaps  for  as  limited  a period  as  that  which  separates  the  two  inscriptions I.Erythrai 2  and  IG i\u00b3  14.  This  may  be  inferred  from  the Athenian  regulations  for  Erythrai  (IG i\u00b3  14),  in  which  the previous  regime  in  Erythrai  is  referred  to  as  tyrannoi  (l. 33). It  is  not  known  to  what  extent  the  regulations  of  IG i\u00b3  14 were  implemented.  In  the  beginning  of  C 4  there  was  a 1074 rubinstein democracy  in  place  in  Erythrai  (Tod 106  I.Erythrai 6); but  an  Athenian  decree  of  c. 387  testifies  to  a  stasis,  probably between  oligarchs  who  control  the  city  and  democrats  in control  of  the  territory.  The  decree  anticipates  the  demo- crats'  conquest  of  the  town  (SEG 26  1282;  see  Gehrke,  Stasis 68).  An  oligarchic  constitution  can  be  assumed  for  C 4l:  no assembly  is  attested  in  a  C 4m  citizenship  decree  (I.Erythrai 8  Tod 155),  and  a  decree  is  passed  by  the  boule  on  the  pro- posal  of  strategoi,  prytaneis  and  epimenioi  (SEG 31  969 ( 351\u00ad344)).  An  undated  decree  (I.Erythrai 10)  providing  for amnesty  between  Erythraians  in  the  city  and  exiles  (pre- sumably  democrats)  is  normally  placed  in  the  context  of the  reintroduction  of  democracy  by  Alexander  the  Great (Gehrke,  Stasis 69). The  eponymous  official in C 5  Erythrai  was  the   (I.Erythrai 1.16\u00ad17;  IG i\u00b3  14.5;  SEG 36  1039.29  (c. 400)).  The assembly  is  attested  in  SEG 36  1039.7  (c. 400);  I.Erythrai 6.2  Tod 106  ( 394)  and  I.Erythrai 21.1  ( 334\u00ad332).  IG i\u00b3 14.13\u00ad14  suggests  that  the  Erythraians  already  had  a  boule when  the  Athenian  decree  was  passed;  cf.  I.Erythrai 2  A 20. For  the  boule  in  C 4,see SEG 36  1039.6  (c. 400);  I.Erythrai 6.1 ( 394);  Tod  155  I.Erythrai 8.1  ( 350s);  I.Erythrai 21.1,  10 ( 334\u00ad332).  Among  other  officials w e  find the  \u00b5\u00b5 (I.Erythrai 1.2,  3\u00ad5,  9,  19  (C 5\u00adC4));  a  board  of  (I.Erythrai 1.14  (C 5\u00adC4);  I.Erythrai 21.2\u00ad3  ( 334\u00ad332));  a \u00b5  (I.Erythrai 1.7  (C 5\u00adC4)); (I.Erythrai 2.29 (C 5)); \u00b5  (SEG 31  969.3); (I.Erythrai 9.19\u00ad21,  21.2  ( 334\u00ad332));  an  (I.Erythrai 21.16 ( 334\u00ad332));  and  a  (SEG 36  1039.9\u00ad10  (c. 400)). The  epigraphic  evidence  includes  several  C 5\u00adC4  lists recording  sales  of  real  estate  (I.Erythrai 153\u00ad54;  SEG 37 917\u00ad19).  It  is  uncertain  whether  the  decree  on  trade, I.Erythrai 15  (C 4),  was  passed  by  Chios  (no. 840)  or  by Erythrai. Erythrai  granted  proxenia  and  citizenship  to  Konon  of Athens  and  his  descendants  in  394  (I.Erythrai 6.10\u00ad13  Tod 106)  and  to  Maussolos  of  Mylasa  (no. 913)  and  his  descen- dants  in  the  350s  (I.Erythrai 8.6).In  C 4  proxenia  was  received from  Kolophon  (no. 848)  (AJP 56  ( 1935)  358\u00ad79  iv.6). Erythraian  theorodokoi  to  host  theoroi  from  Argos  (no. 347) are  attested  in  SEG 23  189.ii.3  ( 330\u00ad324). The  civic  subdivisions  of  Erythrai  were  phylai  (I.Erythrai 2.14  (C 5),  14.2  (C 4)),  gene  (SEG 31  969.16)  and  presumably also  chiliastyes  (I.Erythrai 17  from  C 5  is  interpreted  as  a decree  concerning  the  local  affairs  of  the  chiliastys  of the  Pepronioi;  the  earliest  designation  of  this  local  group as  a  chiliastys  is  I.Erythrai 81.14  (C 1)).  There  may  have been  three  phylai  (Jones,  POAG 304).  For  free  non-citizens, see  I.Erythrai 2B.23\u00ad24  (C 5),  with  a  distinction  between emancipated  slaves  and  \"foreigners\"  and  SEG 36  1039.12 (c. 400). Athena  Polias  is  mentioned  in  I.Erythrai 208.8\u00ad9  (C 4e) and 210.1  (C 5\u00adC4e).Other  communal  cults  are  those  of  Zeus Agoraios  (I.Erythrai 2B.8\u00ad10),  and  Apollo  and  Asklepios) (I.Erythrai 205  ( 380\u00ad360)).  In  I.Erythrai 21.14  ( 334\u00ad332)  the Dionysia  are  mentioned  as  an  occasion  where  public  hon- ours  are  to  be  proclaimed.  A  festival  for  Apollo  and Asklepios  is  mentioned  in  I.Erythrai 205.28  ( 380\u00ad360).  SEG 36  1039.3\u00ad4  (c. 400)  contains  evidence  for  theopropoi.  IG i\u00b3 14.3\u00ad5  suggests  a  significant Erythraian presence at the festi- val  of  the  Panathenaia. Some  of  Erythrai's  public  architecture  is  attested  epi- graphically:  the  prytaneion  (I.Erythrai 21.17  ( 334\u00ad332)),  the agora  (I.Erythrai 8.12\u00ad13,  10.16  (C 4),  151.2,  3,  6,  8,  14  (c. 340)) andastoa(I.Erythrai 10.12\u00ad13).  The  earliest  phase  of  the monumental  temple  of  Athena  dates  back  to  C 8,  with rebuilding  work  in  C 6  and  destruction  in  c. 545.  The  temple was  rebuilt  soon  after,  in  the 530s  (Mitchell  ( 1985)  83).  It  is attested  epigraphically  (I.Erythrai 8.14  ( 350s),  21.20 ( 334\u00ad332)),  as  are  the  Herakleion  (I.Erythrai 21.20\u00ad21)  and  a number  of  other  cult  sites  mentioned  in  I.Erythrai 151 (c. 340),  including  sanctuaries  of  Athena  ( 12),  Apollo  ( 25), Artemis  ( 34)  and  Achilles  ( 36).  SEG 36  1039  (c. 400)con- cerns  the  construction  of  a  new  temple  for  Aphrodite Pandemos.  A  theatre  is  attested  from  C 4l(TGR  iii. 451), which  was  apparently  still  under  construction  in  C 3 (I.Erythrai 24.32  ( 277\u00ad275)).  As  for  the  involvement  of  the Erythraian  government  in  matters  relating  to  infrastruc- ture, see I.Erythrai 151  (c. 340):  water reservoirs, [  ] [],  may  be  referred  to  in  l. 1,  and  an  extensive network  of  public  roads  through  Erythraian  territory  is attested  in  this  inscription.  There  are  two  categories  of road: \u00b5  and \u00b5  (Engelmann and  Merkelbach  ( 1972)  247).  The  acropolis  is  mentioned  in IG i\u00b3  15.44  (c. 450);  and  I.Erythrai 21  (C 4)  mentions  demoli- tion  of  the  acropolis,  to  which  the  honorand  Phanes Mnesitheou  has  contributed.  In 1966  there  were  excava- tions  of  Tempelschutt  on  the  acropolis  dating  from c. 670\u00ad545  (Mellink  ( 1967)  169).  The  city  walls  of  Erythrai enclose  an  area  of 135  ha  and  are  dated  to  C 4l,  and I.Erythrai 22  relates  to  their  construction  (Migeotte  ( 1992) 211\u00ad13  no. 68;  McNicoll  ( 1986)  310  with  fig. 156);  cf.  Diod. 19.60.4  for  a  siege  of  the  city  in 315. Erythrai  struck  silver  and  bronze  coins  in  C 6\u00adC4. ( 1)  Silver  on  the  Milesian  standard,  before  480:  denomina- tions:  didrachm,  trihemidrachm,  tetrobol,  diobol.  Types: ionia  1075 obv.  naked  horseman;  rev.  incuse  square  containing  rosette. ( 2)  Silver,  c. 480\u00ad400:  denominations:  drachm,  trihemiobol, obol,  tetartemorion:  obv.  naked  man  holding  horse,  or Pegasos,  or  bull's  head;  rev.  incuse  square  containing  rosette; legend: .(3) Bronze,  C 5:  obv.  head  of  Herakles  in lion's  skin;  rev.  various  types;  legend: .(4) Silver and bronze,  C 4:  denominations:  tetradrachm,  drachm,  fractions in  bronze:  obv.  head  of  Herakles  in  lion's  skin;  rev.  various types;  legend: and  magistrate's  name.

According  to  Babelon,  Erythrai  stopped minting  coins,  as  did  Chios  (no. 840),  in  356  and  resumed only  in  the  Hellenistic  period. 846. ", "Teos": "Identifier: 869. , appears  to  have  remained  a Peloponnesian  ally  until  induced  to  secede  by  Pharnabazos and  Konon  in  394  (Diod. 14.84.3,  perhaps  corrupt). On  the  basis  of  SEG 31  985.16\u00ad17  Nomima  I 105  it  was argued  by  Lewis  ( 1982)  that  the  constitution  of  C 5  Teos must  have  been  a  democracy.  The  passage  requires  a  quo- rum  of,  presumably, 200  for  any  decision  on  penalties involving  confiscation  of  property,  imprisonment  or  death made  by  a  court  or  assembly,  a  figure  that  Lewis  regarded  as relatively  high.  See,  however,  Gauthier's  note  of  caution ( 1990)  85\u00ad86.  \"The  law  of  the  polis\"  is  referred  to  in  SEG 31 985.A19.  The  instruction  on  synoecism  with  Lebedos  (no. 850)of  303  mentions  Teian  laws  in  existence  (Syll. \u00b3 344.56\u00ad57).  In  C 4l  the  eponymous  official  was  the (SEG 2579.21\u00ad22  PEP  Teos 39).  In  C 5  the  fol- lowing  officials  are  attested:  aisymnetes  (ML 30.B.3);  a board  of  timouchoi  (ML 30.B.29;  SEG 31  985.D.11),  tamias (SEG 31  985.D.11)  and  a  phoinikographeus  (SEG 31 985.D.19\u00ad20).  Most  interpretations  regard  the  aisymnetes  as an  office  which  had  been  abolished  on  the  grounds  that previous  office-holders  had  used  their  position  to  exercise tyrannical  power  (Koerner  ( 1993)  298\u00ad99).  A  Teian  strate- gos  is  attested  in  Aen.  Tact. 18.16.The  phyle  of  the  Geleontes is  known  from  two  inscriptions  (PEP  Teos 121  and 132). Both  are  undated,  but  since  the  Geleontes  was  one  of  the old  Ionian  phylai,  the  presumption  is  that  its  existence  in Teos  goes  back  a  long  way. SEG 2579  PEP  Teos 39  contains  detailed  information on  taxation  levied  internally  in  Teos.  Not  only  did  a  num- ber  of  liturgies  fall  on  citizens  (and  presumably  also  resid- ent  aliens);  but  taxes  were  also  levied  on  the  rearing  of sheep  and  pigs,  and  on  a  number  of  other  commercial activities,  including  wood,  medicine  and  sale  of  wool  and clothes. Teian  grants  of  proxenia  are  attested  in  Syll. \u00b3344.23\u00ad24 (c. 303),  and  SEG 2579  PEP  Teos 39  (C 4l)  is  conventionally ionia  1101 interpreted  as  a  grant  of  ateleia  for  a  period  of  ten  years  to recently  naturalised  citizens  of  Teos.  A  grant  of  citizenship by  Ephesos  (no. 844)  to  a  Teian  is  found  in  I.Ephesos 1437 ( 322/1);  Teian  theorodokoi  to  host  theoroi  from  Argos  (no. 347)  are  attested  in  SEG 23  189.ii.5  ( 330\u00ad324). The  following  festivals  are  attested  for  C 5:  Anthesteria, Herakleia  and  a  festival  of  Zeus  (ML  30.B.31\u00ad35).  As for  the Teian  calendar,  only  two  months  are  attested  for  the  Archaic and  Classical  periods: (SEG 2579.21  (C 4))  and (Anac.  fr. 362,  PMG  Page),  both  attested  in other  Ionian  poleis  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 105\u00ad6  \u00a7 90). The  Teian  acropolis  was  fortified,  and  remains  of  Archaic public  architecture  were  described  by  B\u00e9quignon  and Laumonier  ( 1925)  284.  Tuna's  recent  survey  revealed  the foundations  of  a  long  building  of  massive ashlar  blocks, measuring  38.46 7.30  m.  The  city  walls  surrounding  the urban  centre  of  Teos  in  C 6  are  mentioned  in  Hdt. 1.168.  This wall  must  have  been  pulled  down,  perhaps  in  494,  but  was rebuilt  by  the  Athenians  (Thuc. 8.16.3),  only  to be  demol- ished  once  again  in  411  (Thuc. 8.16.3,  20.2).  From  the description  in  Aen.  Tact. 18.13\u00ad19  of  the  stratagem  used  by Temenos  of  Rhodos,  it  can  be  inferred  that  the  city  had  sub- stantial  fortifications again in C 4,  and  Tuna's survey  of  Teos recorded  remains  of  the  Classical  or  early  Hellenistic  city wall  which  seems  to  have  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 80  ha (McNicholl  ( 1997)  159\u00ad60;  Mitchell  ( 1999)  148).  Ps.-Skylax 98  refers  to the  harbour  of  Teos. Teos  struck  electrum  coins  in  C 6f  and  silver  coins  on  the Aiginetan  standard  in  C 6s\u00adC5  and  on  the  Phoenician  stan- dard  in  C 4.A  few  gold  coins  were struck  in  C 4.(1)  Electrum, C 6f:  denominations:  stater,  twenty-fourth.  Types:  obv.  grif- fin's head;  rev.  square  punch.  ( 2)  Silver,  C 6\u00adC5:  denomina- tions:  stater,  drachm,  hemidrachm,  trihemiobol,  obol, hemiobol.

A Teian  silver  drachm  and  a  number  of  silver  staters  were found  in  the  Asyut  hoard,  dating  from  499\u00ad494  (Price  and Waggoner ( 1975)  85).Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 2  nos. 1930\u00ad55,(1930) 53\u00ad54;Head,  HN \u00b2  595;  Balcer  ( 1968);  Sear  ( 1979)  322;  BMC Ionia 309\u00ad13;  SNG  Cop.  Ionia 1433\u00ad43. Teos  participated  in  the  colonisation  of  Naukratis  (no. 1023)  (Hdt. 2.178.2),  and  founded  Phanagoria  (no. 706)  on the  Black  Sea  in  544  and  Abdera  (no. 640)  in  c. 540,  a  founda- tion  with  which  Teos  maintained  very  close  ties  in  the Classical  period  (ML  30;  SEG 31  985),to  the  extent  that  regu- lations  passed  at  Teos  were  to  be  enforced  also  at  Abdera. 869.

According  to  Maiandros  of  Miletos  (FGrHist 491)  fr. 1, Samos  (no. 864)  received  Anaia  as  a  dependency  from Kolophon  (no. 848)  in  the  wake  of  the  Meliac  War  (c. 700), and  it  remained  a  part  of  the  Samian  peraia  in  the  Classical and  Hellenistic  periods  (Ps.-Skylax  98).It  is  hard  to  decide  if Anaia  was  a  dependent  polis  whose  citizens  had  a  communal identity  distinct  from  that  of  the  Samians.  At  3.19.2 Thucydides  uses  the  collective  city-ethnic  in  a  reference  to  a military  action  by  the  Anaiitai  ( \u00b5     ).  Conventionally  the  Anaiitai  of  Thuc. 3.19.2 are  identified w ith  the  exiled  Samian  oligarchs  who  sup- ported  the  Peloponnesians  from  their  base  at  Anaia  (e.g. Robert ( 1959)  21;  Shipley  ( 1987)  35;  Hornblower  ( 1991)  405). There  can  be  little  doubt  that  this  splinter  community would  still  perceive  itself  as  Samian  (Thuc. 3.32.2,  4.75.1). The  same  probably  applies  to Thucydides'  mention  of  an Anaiitan  warship  in  8.61.2  ( \u00b5   ),  which  assisted Leon  of  Sparta  at  the  battle  of  Chios  in  411.The  ship  was  pre- sumably  provided  by  the  Samian  exiles,  and  Thucydides may  have  used  the  adjective  in  order  to  avoid  the  possible misunderstanding  that  the  ship  was  provided  by  the Samians  on  the  island.  Barron  identifies two Samian silver coin  types  that  were  probably  struck  at  Anaia  during  this period.  One  type  carries  the  legend  ,which,as Barron sug- gests  ( 1966)  93,  may be  the  initial  of (),  while the  other  has  the  legend   .  According  to Barron  ( 1966)  92,  Batis  may  have  been  either  the  leader  of the  oligarchic  faction  or  an  overseer  appointed  by Pissouthnes. By  the  terms  of  the  Peace  of  Antalkidas  in  386,  Samos  was outside  the  sphere  of  influence of  the  Persian  king,  while  her peraia  was  defined as part of  Persian  territory.  The  implica- tions  for  the  political  relationship  between  Samos  and  the settlements  on  the  mainland  cannot  be  ascertained.  If  the ionia  1063 Persians  insisted  on  control  of  the  former  peraia  of  Samos for  taxation  purposes  only,  this  may  not  have  prevented Samos  from  maintaining  political  ties  with  its  former  pos- sessions.  A  continuation  of  Samian  involvement  on  the mainland  may  explain  how  the  Samians  could  settle  at Anaia  after  their  expulsion  from  their  island  by  the Athenians  in  365  (see  most  recently  Hallof  and  Habicht ( 1995)). It  has  been  suggested  by  Fantasia  ( 1986),  primarily  on  the basis  of  CID ii  6A.1:[ ]   ' '  [ ]),  that  the inhabitants  of  Anaia  from  365  to 322/1  no  longer  regarded themselves  as  Samian  citizens.  However,  an  alternative  read- ing  of  CID ii  6  is  [ ']  (i.e.  the  city-ethnic  of  Elaia (no. 807)  in  Aiolis),  if  '  [ ] was used in the general sense  of  \"Asia  Minor\"  rather  than  in  the  narrow  sense  of \"Ionia\".  The  fragile  connection  between  Samos  and  its  pera- ia  seems  to  be  a  recurrent  theme  in  the  history  of  the  island. See  most  recently  Hallof  and  Mileta  ( 1997)  and  Schuler ( 1998)  177\u00ad79  for  the  Hellenistic  period. 839. ", "Samos": "Identifier: 866. , (Samios)  (to 365)Map  61.  Lat. 37.40,long. 26.55.  Size  of  territory: 4  ( 468.3  km \u00b2),  but  probably 5 including  the  Samian  peraia.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is \u00b5,  (Aesch.  Pers. 882;  Hdt. 3.48.2),  denoting  both  the island  (Hdt. 3.120.3)  and  the  city  (Hdt. 3.54.1).  The  city- ethnic  is \u00b5  (I.Ephesos 115  (C 6);  F.Delphes iii.4  455 (C 5e);  Hdt. 1.51.3).  In  C 5  Samos  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the urban  sense  (Hdt. 3.54.1;  Thuc. 1.116.2)  and  in  the  political sense  (Hdt. 3.139.1;  Thuc. 8.21);  the  territorial  sense  is  some- times  a  connotation  (Thuc. 4.75.1).  In  C 4  again,  both  the urban  sense  (Ps.-Skylax 98;Isoc.  15.107.8)  and  the  political sense  (Xen.  Hell. 2.3.7;  Arist.  Pol. 1287a37\u00ad38)  are  attested. Samos  is  called  asty  at  Anac.  frr. 353  and 448,  Page.  The  des- ignation  polites  is  applied  to  citizens  of  Samos  in  Hdt. 3.45.4 (rC 6)  and  Xen.  Hell. 2.3.7,  while  the  Samian  politeia  in  the sense  of  constitution  is  mentioned  in  Thuc. 1.115.2;  IG i\u00b3 127.19\u00ad20  ( 405);  and  [Arist.]  Ath.  Pol. 24.2  (rC 5).  A \u00b5 was  included  among  the 158  Aristotelian  consti- tutions  (fr. 591.1;  cf.  frr. 588\u00ad95).  The  verb  politeuein/poli- 1094 rubinstein teuesthai  is  used  in  Thuc. 8.73.6  and  IG i\u00b3  127.13  ML 94.13 ( 405).  In  Hdt. 3.44.2,  142.2  and 143.1  Samian  citizens  are referred  to  as  astoi.For  patris  referring  to  Samos,  see  Hdt. 3.140.5  and  SEG 22  483.1  (C 4f).  The  collective  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  a  C 5e  dedication  quoted at  Hdt. 4.88.2  and  in  abbreviated  form  on  C 5l\u00adC4  coins (infra),  and  externally  in  IG i\u00b3  1365A.i.1  (C 6);  Thuc. 7.57.4 (C 5);  and  Arist.  Oec. 1350b6.  The  individual  and  external use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  I.Ephesos 115  (C 6)  and  IG i\u00b3  1366  (C 6\u00adC5).  In  the  collective  grant  of  citizenship  by Athens  in 405,  the  honorands  are  classified  as  both  Samians and  Athenians  (IG i\u00b3  127.12).  The  collective  form  of  the city-ethnic  is  used  retrospectively  in  a  number  of  Samian honorific  decrees  bestowed  on  the  benefactors  of  the  exiled Samian  demos  (IG xii.617.5\u00ad6,  24.6\u00ad7). The  Samian  territory  in  its  entirety  is  referred  to  as   in  Hdt. 6.22.1,  and  it  is  designated  \u00b5  in  Hdt. 9.96.1.A study  of  the  settlement  pattern  of  ancient  Samos  is  given  by Shipley  ( 1987)  231\u00ad68.Apart  from  Samos  itself,  Barr.records only  four  settlements  of  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods: Kazania  (Barr.,  AC),  Manolates  (Barr.,  A),  Neo  Karlovasi (Barr.,  C)  and  Neokhorion  (Barr.,  AC),  plus  one  fort  at  Ag. Ioannis  (Barr.,  AC). The  size  of  the  Samian  citizen  population  cannot  be ascertained.  From  the  number  of  Samian  ships  at  Lade  in 494  and  in  the  navy  in  action  in  440,  Shipley  ( 1987)  12\u00ad15 suggests  a  population  figure of 30,000\u00ad50,000,  including women,  resident  aliens  and  slaves. According  to  Hdt. 5.99.1,  Samos  supported  the Chalkidian  side  in  the  so-called  Lelantine  War  (C 8l?),  and Samian  forces  also  assisted  the  Spartans  in  a  war  against  the Messenians  (Hdt. 3.47.1),presumably  the  Second  Messenian War  (C 7).  In  C 6  Samian  troops  distinguished  themselves  in the  battle  at  Salamis  in  Cyprus  against  Persian  and Phoinikian  forces  (Hdt. 5.112.1).  Around  517  the  conquest  of Samos  was  allegedly  completed  successfully  by  Otanes;  the entire  population  was  allegedly  killed  and  the  Persians handed  over  \"an  empty  island\"  to  Syloson  (Hdt. 3.147\u00ad49); but  Otanes  repopulated  the  island  soon  afterwards. Samos  belonged  to  the  Ionian  dodekapolis  (Hdt. 1.142.4), and  the  Samians  took  part  in  the  Ionian  Revolt  in  499  and provided  sixty  triremes  at  the  battle  of  Lade  in  494  (Hdt. 6.8.2).After  the  failure  of  the  Ionian  Revolt,  which  led  to  the reinstatement  of  Aiakes  II  as  tyrant  with  Persian  backing, many  wealthy  Samians  went  into  exile  and  settled  at  Zankle (no. 51),  driving  out  the  Zanklaians  (Hdt. 6.22\u00ad24;  Arist.  Pol. 1303a35\u00ad36).  The  Samians  fought  on  the  Persian  side  in 480/79  (Hdt. 8.85)  but  joined  the  Greeks  before  the  battle  of Mykale  (Hdt. 9.90\u00ad92)  and  were  accepted  as  members  of  the Hellenic  League  after  the  battle  (Hdt. 9.106.4).  Samos  was among  the  earliest  members  of  the  Delian  League  (Hdt. 9.106.4)  and,  alongside  Chios  (no. 840)  and  Lesbos,  the Samians  maintained  their  status  as  an  autonomos  ally  of Athens  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 24.2,  but  see  Pol. 1284a39\u00ad40).  Yet,  in 441/0  they  revolted  after  Athenian  interference  in  their  war against  Miletos  (no. 854)  and  their  installation  of  a  demo- cratic  government  on  the  island  (Thuc. 1.115.2\u00ad3).  After  a protracted  siege  (Thuc. 1.115.4\u00ad117.2)  the  Samians  were forced  back  into  the  alliance  and  had  to  pull  down  their walls,  surrender  their  fleet,  and  pay  a  large  war  indemnity (Thuc. 1.117.3;  IG i\u00b3  48  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 159).  The  oligarchs who  had  left  Samos  in  441/0  during  the  democratic  regime but  had  returned  and  instigated  the  Revolt  in  440  (Thuc. 1.115.4)  went  into  exile  once  again,  and  many  of  them  settled in  Anaia  (no. 838)  (Thuc. 3.32.2,  4.75.1;  see  Gehrke,  Stasis 143\u00ad44).  Samos  was  now  perceived  as  a  tribute-paying member  of  the  alliance  (Thuc. 7.57.4),  although  it  is  never attested  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists.  Samos  remained  a member  for  the  duration  of  the  Peloponnesian  War,  in  spite of  two  attempted  secessions  in  412  and 411  staged  by  the Samian  \u00e9lite,  both  of  which  were  prevented  at  the  eleventh hour  (Thuc. 8.21  and 8.63.3).In  412  Samos  regained  its  status as  an  autonomos  member  of  the  League  (Thuc. 8.21).  After the  Athenian  defeat  at  Aigos  potamoi,  the  Samians  massa- cred  their  oligarchs  (Xen.  Hell. 2.2.6)  and  sent  envoys  to Athens  (IG i\u00b3  127.7\u00ad8).  Athenian  citizenship  was  conferred on  all  Samians,  but  their  autonomia  was  guaranteed  (IG i\u00b3 127.11\u00ad18).  After  the  end  of  the  Peloponnesian  War,  a decarchy  was  imposed  on  Samos  by  Lysandros  after  the expulsion  of  Samian  citizens  and  the  return  of  oligarchic exiles  (Xen.  Hell. 2.3.6\u00ad7;Diod.  14.3.4\u00ad5;  Shipley  ( 1987) 131\u00ad33).  Some  of  the  exiled  Samian  democrats  settled  in Notion  (no. 858)  and  Ephesos  (no. 844)  (IG ii\u00b2 1.48\u00ad49  Tod 97  ( 403/2)).  The  Samians  displayed  their  loy- alty  by  dedicating  a  statue  of  Lysandros  at  Olympia  (Paus. 6.3.15).  Samos  presumably  remained  a  Spartan  ally  until Konon's  victory  in  the  battle  of  Knidos  in  394  (Paus. 6.3.16), but  Samos  was  subsequently  forced  back  into  an  alliance with  Sparta  in  391  (Diod. 14.97.3).  In  366/5  Samos  was  con- quered  by  Timotheos  (Isoc. 15.111;Dem.  15.9)  and  turned into  an  Athenian  klerouchy  (no. 865). Samos  was  renowned  as  a  hegemonic  sea  power  during the  reign  of  Polykrates  (Hdt. 3.39.3\u00ad4,  122.2;  Thuc. 1.13.6), who  allegedly  had  100  pentekonteres  and 1,000  archers  at  his disposal  (Hdt. 3.39.3),  and  Samos  deployed  sixty  triremes  at the  battle  of  Lade  (Hdt. 6.8.2,  14.2).  In  440\u00ad439  the  Samians ionia  1095 had  a  considerable  naval  force  engaged  in  their  rebellion against  the  Athenians  (Thuc. 1.116.1,  117.1\u00ad2).  They  were compelled  to  hand  over  their  fleet after their defeat,  but  in 406  ten  Samian  ships  under  a  Samian  commander  fought  in the  battle  of  Arginousai  (Xen.  Hell. 1.6.25,  29).  A  contingent of  Samian  troops  participated  in  the  Sicilian  expedition (Thuc. 7.57.4),  and  Samian  strategoi  are  honoured  in  IG i\u00b3 127.8. The  constitutional  history  of  Samos  before  Polykrates  is obscure.  A  C 6  basileus,  Amphikrates  (Hdt. 3.59.4),  may  have been  an  eponymous  official r ather  than  a  king  (Shipley ( 1987)  37).  On  the  basis  of  Plutarch's  rather  late  and  anec- dotal  account  at  Mor. 303E\u00ad304C,  it  is  normally  assumed that  Samos  from  C 7  was  ruled  by  an  oligarchy  of  wealthy landowners  (the  geomoroi),  that  the  rule  of  the  geomoroi  fol- lowed  after  the  murder  of  the  monarch  Demoteles,  and  that the  oligarchy  remained  in  place  until  a  successful  Samian intervention  in  a  war  between  the  Megarians  (no. 225)  and Perinthians  (no. 678),  when  the  Samian  demos  staged  a  coup and  \"liberated\"  the  polis  (Shipley  ( 1987)  39\u00ad41).  Demoteles may  have  been  a  tyrant  whose  rule  represented  an  interrup- tion  of  the  oligarchy  of  the  geomoroi  (ibid. 49).  However, Thucydides  at  least  confirms that the Samian aristocracy was  still  referred  to  as  geomoroi  as  late  as  412,  when  a  ban  on intermarriage  between  the  geomoroi  and  the  rest  of  the Samians  was  instituted  ( 8.21). The  period  of  tyranny  at  Samos  started  in  the 590s  with the  alleged  coup  of  Syloson  I,  known  only  from  Polyaen. 6.45.  For  a  reconstruction  of  the  succession  of  tyrants  from Syloson  I  to  Polykrates,  see  Shipley  ( 1987)  70\u00ad72.  Polykrates ruled  as  tyrant  of  Samos  from,  probably,  the 540s  (ibid. 74\u00ad80)  until 522,  when  he  was  crucified  by  Oroites  (Hdt. 3.125.2\u00ad3).  He  first  ruled  jointly  with  his  two  brothers, Syloson  II  and  Pantagnotos,  but  soon  killed  Pantagnotos and  exiled  Syloson  II  (Hdt. 3.39.2).  After  Polykrates'  death, Maiandrios  offered  the  Samians  isonomie  (Hdt. 1.142.3; Raaflaub  ( 1985)  130\u00ad31),  but  stasis  soon  broke  out,  and Syloson  II  was  subsequently  installed  as  tyrant  with  Persian backing.  Aiakes  II,  the  son  of  Syloson  II,  had  succeeded  his father  as  tyrant  by 514  (Hdt. 4.138.2),  but  he  was  ousted from  the  tyranny  in 499,  allegedly  at  the  instigation  of Aristagoras  of  Miletos  (Hdt. 6.13.2).  It  is  not  known  what type  of  regime  was  set  up  after  his  fall,  but  he  was  reinstat- ed  as  tyrant  by  the  Persians  again  immediately  after  the Ionian  defeat  in 494  and  presumably  ruled  until 492  when, allegedly,  demokratia  was  imposed  on  the  Ionian  poleis  by Mardonios  (Hdt. 6.43.3).  The  last  Samian  tyrant  was Theomestor,  who  had  power  handed  to  him  by  the  Persians in  return  for  his  loyalty  in  the  battle  of  Salamis  (Hdt. 8.85.3).  The  constitution  of  Samos  after  the  Persian  defeat at  Mykale  was  probably  oligarchic  and  may  have  remained so  until  replaced  by  an  Athenian-backed  democracy  in 441 (Thuc. 1.115.2\u00ad3;  Ath.  Pol. 24.2).  The  view  that  oligarchy  was introduced  only  in 454/3  (Barron  ( 1966)  89)  is  countered  by Gehrke,  Stasis 140  n. 3.  Samos  probably  remained  demo- cratic  until  the  end  of  the  Peloponnesian  War  (Hornblower ( 1991)  192\u00ad93),  in  spite  of  the  oligarchic  threat  in 412  and 411  (Thuc. 8.21,  73.2).  Oligarchy  was  imposed  on  Samos  by Lysandros  after  the  Athenian  defeat  in 404  (Xen.  Hell. 2.3.6\u00ad7),  and  it  may  have  remained  oligarchic  even  after  the battle  of  Knidos  in 394  (Gehrke,  Stasis 144\u00ad45),  and  right down  to 365,  when  the  Athenians  set  up  their  klerouchy  on the  island. The  Samian  political  institutions  are  poorly  known  since, so  far,  not  one  single  public  enactment  antedating  365  has been  found.  A  Samian  boule  is  attested  in  IG i\u00b3  127.8  ( 405), while  a  Samian  assembly  (ekklesie)  was  allegedly  convened by  Maiandrios  after  Polykrates'  death  in  522  (Hdt. 3.142.2). An  honorific decree passed b y  the  koinon  of  the  Samians  and set  up  in  the  Samian  agora  after  the  battle  of  Lade  is  men- tioned  in  Hdt. 6.14.3,and  Samian  nomoi  are  referred  to in  IG i\u00b3  127.15.In IG xii.6478  (C 5)  Telesandros  and  Demagores  are attested  as  elected  supervisors  of  a  public  construction  of  a bridge.  A  board  of  gynaikonomoi  is  attested  in  IG xii.6461 (C 4f). The  only  thing  known  about  civic  subdivisions  is  that  the citizens  of  Perinthos  (no. 678),  a  Samian  colony,  were  sub- divided  into  the  six  Ionian  phylai.  It  seems  reasonable  to pre- sume  that  the  system  was  taken  over  from  the  metropolis (Jones,  POAG 195\u00ad97).  The  well-attested  subdivision  of  the citizen  body  into  phylai,  chiliastyes,  hekatostyes  and  gene  (IG xii.618.21\u00ad23  (C 4l))  was  introduced  after  the  expulsion  of the  Athenian  klerouchs  in  322/1  (Jones,  POAG 195\u00ad97; Shipley  ( 1987)  284\u00ad92  suggests  an  earlier  date).  In  C 4l  the Samians  granted  proxenia  to  a  citizen  of  Gela  (no. 17)  (IG xii.633),  and  a  grant  of  proxenia  was  received  from  Athens (no. 361)  by  Pronos  Thyionos  Samios  (SEG 37  70  IG ii\u00b2  64 425  293  ( 375\u00ad350)).  A  block  grant  of  Athenian  citizenship was  received  by  the  entire  Samian  population  in  405  (IG i\u00b3 127).The  earliest  recorded  Samian  grants  of  proxenia  and/or citizenship  date  from  the  period  after  322.  The  following funerary  monuments  commemorate  non-citizens  who were  presumably  buried  in  Samos  in  the  period  before  the Athenian  klerouchy:  PEP  Samos 521  (Miletos  (C 5));  PEP Samos 548  (Kolophon  (C 5));  and  PEP  Samos 571  (Kyzikos (C 5)). 1096 rubinstein The  Samian  acropolis,  which  was  apparently  fortified in C 6,  is  attested  in  Hdt. 3.143.1,  144  and 146.2.  An  Archaic  city wall  is  attested  in  Herodotos'  account  of  Polykrates  ( 3.39.4) and  the  Spartan  siege  of  Samos  in  524  ( 3.54.1\u00ad2).  The  urban centre  of  Samos  may  well  have  remained  fortified until the Athenians  forced  the  Samians  to  demolish  their  walls  in 439/8  (Thuc. 1.117.3).  Samos  was  still  ateichistos  in 411  (Thuc. 8.51.2),  when  the  Athenians  had  to  fortify  the  city  in  a  hurry in  the  face  of  an  (allegedly)  impending  attack  by Peloponnesian  forces  (Thuc. 8.51.2).  Samos  was  also  forti- fied in C 4f  (Arist.  Oec. 1350b;Diod.  16.21.2).  Kienast  ( 1978) 94\u00ad103  identifies three building phases for the walls:  the  first in  polygonal  masonry  (the  Archaic  wall),  the  second  in  ash- lar  masonry  (presumably  C 4e  and  at  any  rate  earlier  than 290),  and  the  third  in  pseudo-polygonal  masonry.  The  city wall  encompassed  an  area  of  c. 103  ha. A  Samian  agora  is  mentioned  in  Hdt. 3.42.2  (rC 6s) (probably  anecdotal)  and  Hdt. 6.14.3.A  proasteion  is  men- tioned  in  Hdt. 3.54.1  and 142.2.  The  mole  in  the  harbour  of Samos,  attributed  to  Polykrates  by  Hdt. 3.60.3,  has  been located  through  underwater  surveys  in 1988  (BCH 113 ( 1989)  673).  Other  large-scale  public  works  assigned  to Polykrates'  reign  are  ship  sheds  (Hdt. 3.45.4)  and  the famous  Eupalinos  tunnel  (Hdt. 3.60.1\u00ad2;  Kienast  ( 1995)).  A bouleuterion  is  mentioned  by  Plut.  Mor. 304B  in  connection with  the  Samian  people's  coup  against  the  ruling  oligarchs c. 700.  An  Archaic  fountain  house  was  published  in T\u00f6lle-Kastenbein  ( 1975)  212  (see  further  Giannouli  ( 1996)). A  theatre  is  mentioned  in  a  C 4l  honorific  decree  (IG xii.6 150.3). Of  sanctuaries  the  most  famous  was  the  Heraion,  located outside  the  urban  centre.  The  first H eraion  can  be  dated  as early  as  C 8,  and  it  was  replaced  by  a  C 7  structure.  The  con- struction  of  the  so-called  Rhoikos  temple  began  c. 575  but was  soon  replaced  by  the  monumental  Heraion  praised  in Hdt. 3.6.4.  Construction  appears  to  have  begun  during  the last  three  decades  of  C 6,  and  it  was  apparently  not  finished earlier  than  the  end  of  C 6  (Kyrieleis  ( 1981);  Klose  ( 1999) 361\u00ad63).  An  Artemis  sanctuary  is  attested  in  Hdt. 3.48.3 (rC 6)  and  on  the  C 5\u00adC4  horos  IG xii.6  266.  Hdt. 3.142.2  con- tains  an  account  of  the  construction  of  an  altar  and  temenos for  Zeus  Eleutherios  by Maiandrios  (rC 6);  but  see  Raaflaub ( 1985)  139\u00ad40,  but  see  Thuc. 2.74.1).According  to  Paus. 2.31.6 and  Diod. 1.98.5\u00ad6,  Samos  also  contained  a  sanctuary  of  the Pythian  Apollo.  IG xii.6238\u00ad44  are  C 5  horoi  of  the  sanctuary of  Athena  Athenon  medeousa,  while  IG xii.6245\u00ad46  are  C 5 horoi  of  the  sanctuary  of  Ion  Athenethen.  IG xii.6527  and 528 are  C 5\u00adC4  altars  of  Apollo  Nymphegetes. According  to  Hdt. 3.48.3,  the  Samians  instituted  a  festival for  Artemis  after  their  successful  attempt  to  rescue  a  number of  children  from  Korkyra  whom  Kypselos  was  exporting  to Sardis.  Another  important  festival  was  the  Heraia,  tem- porarily  renamed  the  Lysandreia  after  the  end  of  the Peloponnesian  War  (Douris  (FGrHist 76)  frr. 26,  71).  Three Olympian  victors  from  Samos  are  known:  Olympionikai 123 ( 532),  399  ( 380)  and  Skaios,  son  of  Duris,  who  apparently participated  during  the  Samians'  period  in  exile  from  their island  (Paus. 6.13.5).  SEG 22  483  (C 4f) may  commemorate  a Samian  victor  in  the  Pythian  Games  (but   \u00b5  is restored).  The  Samians  set  up  a  statue  in  honour  of Lysandros  in  Olympia  (Paus. 6.3.14\u00ad15  (rC 5l)),  while F.Delphes iii.4  455  (C 5e)  is  a  communal  dedication  by  the Samians  to  Apollo  at  Delphi.  A  C 6  kerykeion  was  found  in the  Heraion  (AM  ( 1972)  138\u00ad39),  and  two  others  are  listed  in the  inventory  of  the  treasurers  of  the  Heraion  of 346/5  (IG xii.6261.53). Samos  struck  coins  of  electrum,  silver  and  bronze, c. 600\u00ad365.(1)  Electrum  coins  on  the  Euboic  standard, c. 600\u00ad525:  denominations:  stater  and  fractions  down  to sixth.  Types:  obv.  no  recognisable  type;  rev.  incuse  square and  on  coins  of  higher  denominations  one  or  two  parallel incuse  rectangles  (Barron  ( 1966)  15\u00ad16).  According  to  Hdt. 3.56.2,  Polykrates  bribed  Spartan  forces  to  lift  their  siege  of the  island  in  525  or 524  with  lead  coins  plated  with  gold. Some  of  these  fake  coins  have  survived  (Barron  ( 1966)  17\u00ad18; Kraay  ( 1976)  nos. 68\u00ad69).  ( 2)  Silver  coins  first on the E uboic and  later  on  the  Lydo-Milesian  standard,  c. 530\u00ad439:  denom- inations:  drachm,  triobol,  diobol.  Obv.  forepart  of  winged boar;  rev.  lion's  head  or  scalp.  ( 3)  Silver  coins,  c. 479\u00ad439: denomination:  tetradrachm.  Obv.  lion's  scalp;  rev.  head  and neck  of  bull;  legend: .(3) Silver coins,c.439\u00ad408:denom- inations:  tetradrachm,  trihemiobol.  Obv.  lion's  head  or scalp;  rev.  forepart  of  bull  and  olive branch,  or  ram's  head and  olive  branch.  ( 4)  Silver, 408\u00ad365:  denominations: tetradrachm,  drachm,  hemidrachm,  diobol,  obol.  Obv. lion's  scalp;  rev.  forepart  of  bull  and  olive branch,  or  prow of Samian  galley;  legend: or and  monogram  or magistrate's  name.  ( 4)  Bronze  coins, 394\u00ad365:  obv.Hera wearing  stephane;  rev.  lion's  scalp;  legend: (Barron ( 1966);  SNG  Cop.  Ionia 1673\u00ad96). The  Samians  were  active  colonisers,  founding  Kelenderis (no. 1008)  in  C 8l,  Nagidos  (no. 1010)  at  an  unknown  date, Perinthos  (no. 678)  in  602,  and  Bisanthe  (no. 673)  in  C 6(?). In  the  reign  of  Amasis  Samians  took  part  as  co-colonisers  of Naukratis  (no. 1023),  where  they  had  their  own  sanctuary  of Hera  (Hdt. 2.178.3);  another  Samian  settlement  in  Egypt  was ionia  1097 Oasis  (no. 1024),  founded  at  an  unknown  date.  Samian exiles,  including  Polykrates'  brother  Syloson,  participated  in a  refoundation  of  Kydonia  (no. 968)  in  Crete  in  C 6l.  Other foundations  probably  or  possibly  of  Samian  origin  are Samothrake  (no. 515),  c. 700;  Dikaia  (no. 643),  C 6; Nymphaion  (no. 704),  560s;  and  the  three  poleis  on Amorgos:  Aigiale  (no. 471),  Arkesine  (no. 472)  and  Minoa (no. 473),  founded  at  an  unknown  date. 865.  Samos  (the  klerouchy of 365\u00ad322)In 366/5  an Athenian  squadron  under  Timotheos  conquered  Samos after  a  siege  of  eight  months  (Isoc. 15.11;Dem.  15.9).  The Samians  were expelled  (Diod. 18.18.9;  Heracl.  Lemb. 35; Arist.  no. 129;  Habicht  in  Hallof  and  Habicht  ( 1995);  IG xii.6 42.10\u00ad30).  Subsequently  three  contingents  of  Athenian  kler- ouchs  were  sent  to  the  island:  in  366/5  (Diod. 18.18.9;Arist.fr. 143.1  no. 35),  in  361/0  (Aeschin. 1.53  with  schol.)  and  in  352/1 (Philoch.  fr. 154).  One  of  the  three  contingents  alone  num- bered  2,000  klerouchs  (Arist.  fr. 143.1;Strabo 14.1.18;see Cargill  ( 1995)  17\u00ad21;  Habicht  in  Hallof  and  Habicht  ( 1995) 286\u00ad88  ( 301\u00ad303)).  The  exiled  Samians  settled  in  different poleis  all  over  the  Aegean,  and  some  undoubtedly  set  up home  on  the  former  Samian  peraia,  especially  at  Anaia  (IG xii.642,  43).  A  series  of  honorific decrees passed b y  the Samian  demos  after  their  return  to  the  island  in  322  provide some  information  about  communities  that  allowed  the Samians  to  settle  in  their  territory:  Iasos  (no. 891)  (IG xii.6 17.18),  Rhodos  (no. 1000)  (IG xii.6149)  and  Ephesos  (no. 844)  (IG xii.639)).  Some  may  even  have  settled  as  far  away as  Herakleia  (no. 20)  in  Sicily  (IG xii.638  (C 4l)  with  Kebric ( 1975),  ( 1977)  and  Shipley  ( 1987)  164). During  the  period  of  Athenian  occupation  the  Athenian settlement  on  Samos  shared  many  of  the  characteristics  of  a polis,  although  it  is  not  referred  to  as  polis  in  the personal/political  sense  in  any  contemporary  source (Demades  (fr. 4)  purportedly  characterised  Samos  as  a  frag- ment  broken  off  from  the  Athenian  polis  ( )).The klerouchy is,on the other hand,described as patris  in  IG ii\u00b2  11169.5  (C 4m)  (  '   '  \u00b5 ,  \u00b5);  the  Dionysios  of  this  epigram  is commonly  identified w ith      (LSAG ii  no. 414),who  is  attested  as  klerouch  on Samos  in  Michel  832.2.  Accordingly,  the  two  patrides  men- tioned  in  the  text  should  be  Athens  (patris  by physis)  and  the Athenian  klerouchy  on  Samos  (patris  by nomos).  The  com- munity  of  Athenians  in  Samos  seems  in  many  respects  to have  functioned  independently  of  Athens  and  can  in  that respect  be  compared  to  a  dependent  polis;  cf.  IG ii\u00b2 1443.ii.89\u00ad91,  which  records  a  wreath  bestowed  in  346/5  on the  Athenian  demos  by  the  demos  in  Samos  (not  the  Samian demos).  IG xii.6253  (C 4m)  refers  to the  assembly  (demos)  of Athenians  in  Samos,  and  to  their  boule  in  a  probouleutic capacity.  IG xii.6262  is  a  list  of  bouleutai  and  other  officials in  Samos  (c. 352\u00ad347).  The  boule  numbered 250  bouleutai, and  on  that  basis  it  has  been  suggested  that  the  number  of Athenian  citizens  was  roughly  half  that  of  Athens  itself  in  C 4 (Habicht  in  Hallof  and  Habicht  ( 1995)).  The  other  officials mentioned  in  IG xii.6262  are  the  nine  archontes  ( xi.1\u00ad10),  a grammateus  ( xi.11\u00ad12),  five strategoi  ( xi.13\u00ad18),  a  gramma- teus  demou  ( xi.19\u00ad20),  a  grammateus  boules  ( xi.21\u00ad22),  an official  epi  tois  nomois  ( xi.23\u00ad24),  a  keryx  demou  ( xi.25\u00ad26) and  an  antigrapheus  ( xi.27\u00ad28).  IG xii.6261  is  an  inventory of  the  treasurers  of  the  Heraion  of 346/5.  The  Athenians  in Samos  had  their  own  eponymous  archon  (IG xii.6261 ( 346/5)).IG  xii.6260  is  part  of  a  sacred  law  passed  in  C 4m.A bouleuterion  is  attested  in  IG xii.6257.3.IG  xii.6252  has  been interpreted  by Hallof  ( 2003)  as  a  citizenship  decree  passed  in Samos,  by  which  the  honorand  is  made  an  Athenian  citizen ( 17\u00ad19).  It  is  not  known  if  this  would  also  give  the  honorand the  right  to  enrol  as  a  citizen  in  Athens  proper,  should  he wish  to  settle  there.  That  some  kind  of  dual  citizenship  of  the klerouchy  and  Athens  proper  was  in  operation  is  indicated by  the  status  of  the  philosopher  Epikouros:  he  was  born  in Samos,  but  was  enrolled  as  an  ephebe  in  Athens  (Strabo 14.1.18;Diog.  Laert. 10.1). The  civic  subdivisions  in  the  klerouchy  were  the  same  as the  Athenian  ones,  and  nine  of  the  ten  Kleisthenic  phylai  are attested  in  IG xii.6262.  IG xii.6253.12  mentions  envoys, which  may  indicate  that  the  Athenians  in  Samos  maintained their  own  diplomatic  relations  with  the  outside  world;  IG xii.6263  and 264  are  communal  dedications  set  up  by  the Athenian  demos  in  Samos  to  Apollo  in  Delphi  in  c. 340  and 334/3  respectively,  again  an  indication  of  the  separate  com- munal  identity  of  the  klerouchy. In  addition  to  local  institutions  manned  by  klerouchs, Athenian  officials w ere  sent  from  Athens  to  Samos  (Arist. Ath.  Pol. 62.2),  in  particular  a  strategos  (     \u00b5:IGii\u00b21628.17\u00ad18,28;109\u00ad10,119;I.Priene6.6;IGxii.6 42.4\u00ad5;  cf.  Kroll  and  Mitchel  ( 1980)  91\u00ad92). The  Athenian  klerouchs  were  expelled  in  322/1,  and  the island  given  back  to  the  Samians  (Diod. 18.18.9;Diog.  Laert. 10.1;  IG xii.643.8\u00ad14  (C 4l)). 866. ", "Miletos": "Identifier: 855. , (Milesios) Map  61.  Lat. 37.35,long.  27.15.  Size of  territory: 5.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is  ,  (Hecat. fr. 240;  Thuc. 8.27.6;  Syll. \u00b3273.8  (C 4s)).  The  city-ethnic  is (Hdt. 2.179.1;  Syll. \u00b3273.5  (C 4s)).  The  earliest  ref- erence  to  Miletos  as  a  polis  is  in  Hymn.  Hom.  Ap. 180 (          (C 8\u00adC6?)),  where  polis  is used  in  the  urban  sense.  In  C 5  Miletos  is  called  a  polis  both  in the  urban  sense  (Hdt. 6.20;  Thuc. 8.25.4)  and  in  the  political sense  (Hdt. 5.29.2;  Milet. vi.1  187.7  ML 43).  In  C 4  again, both  the  urban  sense  (OGIS 213.10  (c. 300))  and  the  political sense  (Xen.  An. 1.1.6;  Syll. \u00b3  1002.5  LSAM 44  (c. 400))  are attested.  Polisma  is  found  at  Hdt. 6.6;  for  the  idiom  used,  see Hansen  ( 1995)  61  n. 154.The  polis  cognate  politeia  (citizen- ship)  is  used  in  SEG 38  1193.8  ( 330\u00ad320),  in  which  there  may also  be  an  attestation  of  the  word  polites  (pl.)  in  l. 5.The Aristotelian  collection  of  constitutions  may  have  included  a Milesion  politeia  (Arist.  no. 116),  but  the  evidence  adduced by  Gigon  is  rather  slim.  The  word  asty  is  used  about  the urban  centre  of  Miletos  in  Hdt. 5.29.2  and 5.92. .2;  and  Hdt. 5.99.2  uses  astos  about  the  citizens.  The  collective  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  Milet. i.3135.5  Syll. \u00b3273 (C 4)  and  externally  in  Demodokos  fr. 1.1,  West  (C 6?);  Hdt. 4.137.2;Xen.  An. 1.1.11;  IG i\u00b3  21.67;  and  Tod  195.1  (c. 330).  The individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  Hdt. 4.137.1;Xen.  Hell. 2.1.30;  IG i\u00b3  1356  (C 5);  and  SEG 35  942 (Chios  (C 4)). The  name  of  the  territory  is  (- ) (Hdt.  1.17.2; Thuc. 8.26.3).  It  was  large  and  diverse  and  may  have  been  as much  as 2,000  km \u00b2  (Burford  ( 1993)  19;  Lohmann  ( 1995), ( 1997),  ( 1999);  cf.  Mitchell  ( 1999)  154  for  a  summary).  There were  four  distinct  parts:  Milesia  itself  (the  limestone  penin- sula  on  which  the  city  was  situated  on  the  northern  side); Mt.  Grion  (the  upland  area  to  the  east  of  Milesia);  the  lower Maiandros  valley  (then  on  the  opposite  shore  of  the  Gulf  of Latmos,  controlled  by  Miletos  perhaps  as  far  as  Magnesia); and  the  Milesian  islands  (Leros, Patmos, Lade, Pharmakoussa  and  probably  also  Lepsia).  The  physical  dis- tinction  between  different  parts  of  Milesian  territory  may  be reflected in Hdt. 6.20  (      ...     ,    ).The territory comprised  a  number  of  named  locations:  Assesos  (Hdt. 1.19.1),  Didyma/Branchidai  (Hdt. 1.46.2,  157.3)  and  the  har- bour  Panormos  (Hdt. 1.157.3).  The  city  also  controlled  some areas  in  the  Maiandros  valley  (Hdt. 1.18.1).  As  for  Milesian state  control  of  Didyma,  see  Hdt. 5.36.3:  the  scholar Hekataios  reportedly  suggested  fund  raising  for  the  revolt against  the  Persian  king  by  appropriating  the  temple  treas- ures  donated  by  Kroisos.  Discussing  the  Archaic  period, Tuchelt  ( 1988)  433  n. 55  distinguishes--somewhat anachro- nistically--between z ones  of  Milesian  influence,  directly controlled  areas,  and  communities  that  belonged  to  a Milesian  \"federation\"  (Staatsverband). Assesos  (modern  Mengerevtepe:  Lohmann  ( 1995)  311)  is known from  Herodotos'  account  of  the  destruction  of  the sanctuary  of  Athena  Assessia  by  Alyattes  ( 1.19\u00ad21).  The  location  of  the  sanctuary  is  epigraphically  attested  by  a  C 6 dedication  (Herrmann  ( 1995)  288\u00ad92;  cf.  Wachter  ( 1998)). Lohmann  ( 1995)  313\u00ad14  reports  that  sondages  in  the  temple carried  out  by  von  Graeve  in  1993  confirm the r eport  of  Hdt. 1.19.1  of  the  destruction  of  the  temple  in  the  twelfth  year  of Alyattes'  reign  ( 608  or 598  or 594),  and  a  further  sondage revealed  layers  pointing  to  a  second  destruction  by  the Persians  in  494.  The  sanctuary  seems  to  have  lost  its  signifi- cance  after  the  second  destruction.  Assesos  was  surrounded by  a  C 5s  wall  ( 2  m  wide)  with  three  towers  and  a  gate  pro- tecting  not  only  the  settlement  itself,  but  also  the  coastal  part of  the  Milesian  chora  as  a  whole  (Lohmann  ( 1995)  314\u00ad21). Teichioussa:  the  toponym  is  (I.Didyma 6.1)  or (Thuc. 8.26.3,28.1;  IG i\u00b3  71.i.122).The  only  pos- 1082 rubinstein itive  indication  pointing  to  Teichioussa  as  a  proper (dependent?)  polis  is  I.Didyma 6.1,  in  which  a   is  attested.  However,  he  may  have  been  a  Milesian official w ho  was  in  charge  of  the  settlement.  The  polis  status of  Teichioussa  in  the  Archaic  period  cannot  be  ascertained (see  Gehrke  ( 1980)  30  n. 78,  who  leaves  open  the  possibility that  Teichioussa  became  fully  integrated  into  Milesian territory  only  after  the  return  of  the  democrats  who  had formed  a  splinter  community  there  in  C 5).  It  is  clear  that  if Teichioussa  had  ever  been  a  polis  in  its  own  right  in  the Archaic  period,  it  certainly  was  not  a  member  of  the  Delian League  in  its  own  right:  in  454/3  Teichioussa  provided  a  tem- porary  home  to  Milesian  democrats  loyal  to  Athens  (IG i\u00b3 259.vi.21\u00ad22:[ ]  [  ][]).  In later  years Leros  and  Teichioussa  are  recorded  by  toponym  after  the Milesioi,  and  the  payment  recorded  for  all  three  amounts  to 10  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  284.15\u00ad17  ( 427/6  or 426/5),  285.i.88\u00ad90  ( 421/0) and 489.i.36\u00ad38  ( 416/15)).  In  411  Teichioussa  was  definitely part  of  Milesian  territory  (Thuc. 8.26.3: ). Voigtl\u00e4nder  ( 1986)  627  describes  remains  of fortifications and housing c omplexes  dating  from  between 750  and 550.  He  also  reports  on  the  remains  of  an  Archaic city  wall,  and  he  concludes  on  the  basis  of  finds of  Attic ceramic  that  the  site  was  inhabited  in  C 5m  (ibid. 629\u00ad30).  In a  C 4  source  Teichioussa  is  explicitly  classified as a kome (Archestratos  fr. 42). Leros:  the  toponym  is  ,  (Hdt. 5.125;  Thuc. 8.26.1, 27.1;IG  i\u00b3  284.16).There  is  also  an  attestation  of  the  collective and  individual  use  of  what  may  have  been  a  city-ethnic, (Demodokos  frr. 1\u00ad2,  West  (C 6?).  In  454/3,  like Teichioussa,  Leros  provided  a  temporary  home  to  Milesian democrats  loyal  to  Athens  and  paid  a  phoros  of 3  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 259.vi.21\u00ad22:     ).  In  later  years  Leros  and Teichioussa  are  recorded  by  toponym  after  the  Milesioi,  and the  phoros  recorded  for  all  three  amounts  to  10  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 284.15\u00ad17  ( 427/6  or 426/5),  285.i.88\u00ad90  ( 421/0)  and 489.i.36\u00ad38  ( 416/15)).  According  to  Hdt. 5.125,  Hekataios reportedly  advised  the  Milesian  epitropos  to construct  a fortress  (teichos)  on  the  island,  apparently  under  Milesian control,  and  wait  there  for  an  opportunity  to return  safely  to Miletos.  In  a  C 4s  honorific decree (Manganaro ( 1963\u00ad64) no. 1),  the  inhabitants  of  the  island  refer  to  themselves  as           ( 4,  9\u00ad10) or  as          ( 6),  and  it  is  clear  that by  that  time  the  inhabitants  of  the  island  represented  them- selves  as  Milesian  citizens.  Their  assembly, ( 5), may  have  been  roughly  similar  to  the  assembly  of  an Athenian  deme.  See  further  no. 504. Ionia  Polis  (modern  Mersinet  Iskelesi).  There  is  no  evi- dence  pertaining  to  the  Archaic  or  Classical  periods,  and Peschlow-Bindokat's  assumption  that  the  place  existed  as  a quarry  and  harbour  already  in  the  Archaic  period  rests entirely  on  evidence  from  the  Apollo  temple  at  Didyma (( 1977)  100,(1977\u00ad78)). Didyma,  alternatively  Branchidai  (Hdt. 1.46.2,  92.2,  157.3, with  Ehrhardt  ( 1998)),  was  located  in  Milesian  territory already  in  the  Archaic  period  (Hdt. 1.46.2).  However,  its  sta- tus  in  the  Archaic  and  early  Classical  periods  is  problematic: Tuchelt  ( 1988)  430\u00ad31  suggests  that  Didyma  was  in  fact  an independent  unit  rather  than  just  an  extra-urban  Milesian sanctuary  (see  esp. 433),  but  Ehrhardt  ( 1998)  counters  that all  evidence,  including  the  Sacred  Way  along  with  an  Archaic sacred  law,  points  to  an  early  connection  between  the  cult site  and  the  polis  of  Miletos.  In  C 4m  the  sanctuary  minted  its own  bronze  coins.  Types:  obv.  head  of  Apollo  Didymeus, laureate,  facing  three-quarters  l.;  rev.  lion  standing  l.,  look- ing  back  at  star;  legend:     (Head, HN \u00b2585;  BMC  Ionia 189). As  far  as  the  territory  of  Classical  Miletos  is  concerned, Lohmann  ( 1997)  310  concludes  that  the  minimum  size  of Milesia  proper  must  have  been  at  least  400  km \u00b2.  He  reckons that  the  mountain  range  south  of  the  Gulf  of  Akb\u00fck  provid- ed  a  natural  boundary  to  the  south,  but  notes  that  there  are still  problems  connected  with  fixing the eastern boundary of the  territory  (ibid. 290).  Apart  from  the  marble  quarries  on the  eastern  Gulf  of  Latmos,  the  region  lacks  any  important mineral  resources.  Good  soils  exist  only  on  the  northern side  of  Milesia,  on  a  plain  between  Miletos  and  Assesos,  and around  the  coasts.  The  islands,  Mt.  Grion  and  most  of Milesia  are  hilly  and  have  poor  soils,  unsuitable  for  arable cultivation.  However,  the  deep  rich  lacustrine  soil  of  the Maiandros  valley  is  extremely  fertile  and  retains  moisture well,  making  it  ideal  for  cereal  production  (Braun  ( 1995) 32\u00ad33),  and  it  was  replenished  annually  by  the  flooding of the  river  Maiandros.  This,  in  addition  to  probably  quite extensive  wool  production  on  the  uplands,  made  the  territo- ry  of  Miletos  agriculturally  productive;  and  Milesian  possessions  in  the  Maiandros  valley  were  the  object  of  sever- al  disputes;  cf.  the  C 4e  arbitration  between  Miletos  and Myous  (no. 856)  concerning  territory  in  the  Maiandros  valley  (Tod  113). The  size  of  the  Milesian  population  was  undoubtedly considerable  already  in  the  Archaic  period,  although  it  can- not  be  calculated  with  precision.  It  has  been  estimated  that the  early  Archaic  town  may  have  had  about  4,000  houses (Gates  ( 1995)  238),  undoubtedly  an  exaggerated  figure ionia  1083 (Hansen  ( 2000)  179  n. 208).  But  the  eighty  Milesian  ships  at Lade  in  494  (Hdt. 6.8.1)  and  the  2,000  hoplites  in  424  (Thuc. 4.54.1)  testify  to  a  large  population. According  to  a  tradition  that  may  go  back  as  early  as  C 7, Miletos  was  founded  by  Neileus  (Hdt. 9.97),  whose  heroon may  have  been  located  just  outside  the  Holy  Gate  (Herda ( 1998)).  Archaeological  evidence  points  to  the  existence  of  a (probably)  Ionian  Greek  settlement  from  c. 1050,  and  there are  architectural  remains  of  the  Archaic  urban  centre  dating from  c. 700  (Greaves  ( 2002)  75\u00ad79).  Relatively  little  is  known about  the  history  of  Miletos  in  the  early  Archaic  period,  and most  of  our  literary  and  epigraphical  sources  are  late  and unreliable.  It  is  widely  assumed  that  Miletos  was  ruled  by  an oligarchy  in  the  period  prior  to  the  ascent  of  the  tyrant Thrasyboulos  in  the  last  quarter  of  C 7  (e.g.  Gorman  ( 2001) 101\u00ad21),  but  the  accounts  of  the  rivalries  between  different aristocratic  families  during  C 8  and  C 7  all  date  from  the  late Hellenistic  and  Roman  periods. According  to  Hdt. 1.142.3,  Miletos  belonged  to  the  Ionian dodekapolis.  During  the  Archaic  period  Miletos'  relation- ships  with  other  Greek  poleis  in  the  region  appear  to  have been  determined  to  some  extent  by  its  enduring  hostility towards  Samos  (no. 864),  its  most  significant  commercial rival.  Hdt. 5.99.1  implies  that  Miletos  offered  military assistance  to  Eretria  (no. 370)  in  Euboia  in  its  war  against Chalkis  (no. 365),  mainly  on  the  grounds  that  Samos  was aiding  the  latter  in  the  so-called  Lelantine  War  (on  which see,  e.g.,  Tausend  ( 1992)  137\u00ad45).  Miletos  formed  an  alliance with  Mytilene  (no. 798)  and  perhaps  other  poleis  on  Lesbos (Hdt. 3.39.4),  from  which  it  received  assistance  against Samos  during  the  reign  of  Polykrates,  probably  c. 530  (see e.g.  Tausend  ( 1992)  86\u00ad87).  There  is  also  evidence  of Milesian  engagement  in  other  regional  conflicts.  In  its attempts  to  resist  the  invasions  of  Alyattes  in  C 7,  it  was assisted  by  Chios  (no. 840),  allegedly  in  return  for  the  help that  Miletos  had  given  to  Chios  in  its  war  against  its  main rival  Erythrai  (no. 845)  (Hdt. 1.18.3).  Tausend  ( 1992)  74\u00ad78, 83\u00ad85  discusses  the  evidence  for  two  further  Milesian alliances  in  the  Archaic  period:  one  with  Erythrai  against Naxos  (no. 507),  perhaps  in  the  first  half  of  C 7,  and  the other  with  Samos  against  Priene  (no. 861)  in  the  first  half  of C 6.  During  C 7  Miletos  suffered  repeated  attacks  by  the Lydians  during  the  successive  reigns  of  Gyges,  Ardys, Sadyattes  and  Alyattes  (Hdt. 1.14.4\u00ad22.4).  According  to  Hdt. 1.18.1\u00ad22.4,  the  troops  of  Alyattes  invaded  Milesian  territo- ry  for  twelve  consecutive  years,  until  a  treaty  of  xenia  and symmachia  was  eventually  concluded  between  Alyattes  and the  Milesian  tyrant  Thrasyboulos  in  the  twelfth  year  of Alyattes'  reign  ( 608  or 598  or 594).  Herodotos'  account  of the  accidental  destruction  by  fire  of  the  temple  of  Athena  in Assesos  (modern  Mengerevtepe),  which  ultimately  led Alyattes  to  end  the  war  on  terms  favourable  to  the Milesians,  is  confirmed  by  archaeological  evidence  from the  temple  site  (Lohmann  ( 1995)  313\u00ad14).  The  treaty  may have  been  upheld  by  Alyattes'  successor  Kroisos,  but  this has  been  disputed  (cf.  e.g.  Tausend  ( 1992)  95\u00ad96;  Gorman ( 2001)  123\u00ad24).  After  the  Persian  conquest  of  Lydia,  Kyros  is reported  (Hdt. 1.141.4)  to  have  granted  the  Milesians  the same  terms  as  they  had  previously  had  with  the  Lydians, and  Herodotos  seems  to  assume  that  the  treaty  originally contracted  between  Alyattes  and  Thrasyboulos  had  still been  in  force  during  Kroisos'  reign.  The  granting  of favourable  terms  to  Miletos  by  the  Lydians  and  subse- quently  by  the  Persians  presumably  served  the  purpose  of driving  a  wedge  between  Miletos  with  its  considerable  mil- itary  strength  and  the  other  Ionian  poleis.  If  this  was  indeed the  Lydian  and,  later,  the  Persian  strategy,  it  seems  to  have worked  (Hdt. 1.141.4):  Miletos  held  aloof  from  the  Ionian attempt  to  form  a  united  front  against  the  Persians after 546. It  is  widely  assumed  that  Thrasyboulos'  reign  was  fol- lowed  first  by  the  rule  of  two  further  tyrants,  Thoas  and Damasenor  (Plut.  Mor. 298C\u00adD),  or  by  a  narrow  oligarchy and  then  by  a  period  of  stasis  between  two  factions  called \"the  Aeinautai\"  and  \"the  Cheiromachai\"  respectively.  The stasis  referred  to  by  Plutarch  is  normally  identified  with  the stasis  reported  in  Hdt. 5.28\u00ad29,  which  was  ultimately resolved  by  an  arbitration  process  conducted  by  a  panel from  Paros  (no. 509).  The  Parians  set  up  an  oligarchy  (Hdt. 5.28\u00ad29).  According  to  Hdt. 5.28,  the  stasis  lasted  for  two generations,  but  he  gives  no  precise  date  for  its  resolution. It  has  been  suggested  that  archaeological  evidence  indicat- ing  a  decline  in  Milesian  exports  in  the  period 600\u00ad590 may  have  been  directly  linked  to  civil  unrest  (Greaves ( 2002)  96).  It  is  normally  held  that  the  introduction  of  the new  constitution  after  the  arbitration  coincided  with  the first  recorded  aisymnetes  as  a  Milesian  eponymous  official (Milet. i.3  122;  see  Gorman  ( 2001)  112\u00ad13  for  a  summary  of the  traditional  scholarly  position).  However,  Gorman ( 2001)  113\u00ad15  advocates  c. 540  rather  than  the  traditional date  of 525  as  the  starting  point  of  the  aisymnetes  list.  She rightly  points  out  that  there  may  well  be  a  gap  in  the  list, reflecting  the 15  years  separating  the  Persian  sack  of  Miletos in 494  and  the  reconstruction  of  the  polis  in 479.However, her  argument  that  the  Parian  arbitration  must  be  separated from  the  creation  of  the  office  of  aisymnetes  and  instead  be 1084 rubinstein movedbacktoC 7  or  even  C 8  rests  primarily  on  the assumptions  ( 1)  that  the  Persians  would  not  have  permit- ted  the  resolution  of  the  stasis  by  the  intervention  of  anoth- er  Greek  polis,  and  ( 2)  that  a  period  of  a  maximum  of 25 years  between  the  introduction  of  the  new  constitution  and the  ascent  of  the  tyrant  Histiaios  before 513  would  not  have been  sufficient  to  restore  Milesian  prosperity  (ibid. 115\u00ad21). Her  first  premise,  at  least,  must  be  regarded  as  debatable: (i)  the  Milesians  may  have  had  more  room  for  regulating their  own  internal  affairs  than  other  Ionian  poleis  thanks  to their  favourable  treaty  with  Kyros;  (ii)  the  Persians  are  later known  to  have  allowed  internal  conflicts  in  the  Ionian region  to  be  resolved  by  a  process  of  arbitration  conducted by  other  Greek  states  (Tod 113). From  Hdt. 4.137\u00ad39  it  is  clear  that  the  Milesian  oligarchy must  have  been  replaced  with  the  Persian-backed  tyranny  of Histiaios  by  513,  when  Milesian  troops  under  Histiaios'  com- mand  assisted  the  Persians  in  their  Skythian  campaign.  In return  for  his  services  during  this  campaign  Histiaios  was granted  control  of  Myrkinos  (no. 633)  by  Dareios  (Hdt. 5.11.1\u00ad2),  and  it  appears  from  Herodotos'  account  that  he  first settled  there.  Later  he  was  called  to  Susa  as  adviser  to  the  Great King  ( 5.24.2\u00ad25.2),  leaving  his  cousin  and  brother-in-law Aristagoras  to  rule  Miletos  in  his  absence  (Hdt. 5.30.2). Aristagoras  (in  secret  collaboration  with  Histiaios,  who  was detained  at  Susa)  was  an  important  instigator  of  the  Ionian Revolt  in  499,  according  to  Herodotos  because  he  had  fallen foul  of  the  Persians  as  a  result  of  the  failed  expedition  against Naxos  (no. 507)  in  500  and  was  fearing  for  his  position  within Miletos  ( 5.35\u00ad36.1).  He subsequently  stepped  down (at  least nominally, ) as ruler of  Miletos  and  introduced isonomie  (Hdt. 5.37.2).This  may  have  amounted  to  some  kind of  democracy  (but  see  Gorman  ( 2001)  136).Shortly  before  the Ionian  Revolt  was  quashed  by  the  Persians  in  494,Aristagoras went  into  exile,  and  Histiaios,  who  attempted  to  re-establish his  position  in  Miletos,  was  refused  access  to  the  polis  (Hdt. 6.5.1\u00ad2). After  the  Ionian  defeat  at  the  battle  of  Lade,  to  which  the Milesians  had  contributed  eighty  ships  (Hdt. 6.8),  the Persians  subjected  the  polis  to andrapodismos  and  physical destruction  of  its  urban  centre  (Hdt. 6.18\u00ad20).  According  to Herodotos,  most  men  were  killed,  and  women  and  children enslaved.  The  people  who  were  spared  were  resettled  in Ampe  on  the  Red  Sea.  The  territory  around  the  city  and  the plain  were  occupied  by  Persians,  while  the  rest  was  settled  by Karians.  However,  Herodotos'  claim  that  Miletos  \"was  emp- tied  of  Milesians\"  may  either  be  exaggerated  or  may  refer more  narrowly  to  Miletos'  urban  centre  (contra  Gorman ( 2001)  145\u00ad47).  In  any  case,  Milesian  troops  were  present among  the  Persian  forces  just  before  the  battle  of  Mykale (Hdt. 9.99.3,104).The  physical  destruction  of  Miletos  city  in 494,  on  the  other  hand,  appears  to  have  been  almost  total (but  see  Voigtl\u00e4nder  ( 1984)  156\u00ad58).Archaeologically,  conti- nuity  of  occupation  at  the  site  in  C 5f  cannot  be  proved  or disproved. After  the  defeat  of  the  Persians  at  Mykale,  Miletos  became a  member  of  the  Delian  League  in  478.  It  is  recorded  in  the list  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259  iii.19;  Pi\u00e9rart  ( 1974)),  where Milesioi  from  Leros  and  from  Teichioussa  are  also  recorded as  payers  (IG i\u00b3  259.vi.19\u00ad22).  Then  the  Milesioi  are  record- ed  from  452/1  (IG i\u00b3  261.ii.28)  to  430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.i.14)  pay- ing  first  10  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  263.v.18)  and  from  443/25  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 269.i.33).  From  427/6  (IG i\u00b3  284.15\u00ad17)  to  416/15  (IG i\u00b3 289.i.36\u00ad38)  the  Milesians  are  recorded  with  Leros  and Teichioussa  paying  10  tal.,  and  in  415/14  the  Milesians  are recorded  alone  paying  10  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  290.i.9).  The  Milesians were  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  alongside  Leros  and Teichioussa  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.125).  As  a  member  of  the  Delian League  Miletos  provided  an  army  contingent  for  the Athenian  expedition  against  Corinth  (no. 227)  in  425/4 (Thuc. 4.42),  and  the  Athenians  had  at  their  disposal  more than 2,000  Milesian  hoplites  in  424  (Thuc. 4.54.1).  Milesian troops  also  participated  in  the  Sicilian  expedition  (Thuc. 7.57.4). There  is  no  secure  evidence  for  the  constitution  of Miletos  in  the  period  between  479  and  c. 450,  but  it  is  nor- mally  held  that  the  form  of  constitution  was  an  oligarchy (perhaps  moderate,  so  Gehrke,  Stasis 114).  The  Milesian banishment  decree  (Milet. i.6187  ML 43),  traditionally dated  470\u00ad440,  banishes  a  number  of  prominent  Milesians and  contains  provisions  for  rewarding  anyone  who  kills them.  Although  it  cannot  be  ruled  out  completely  that  the decree  was  passed  after  a  stasis  that  may  have  brought Milesian  democrats  to  power,  and  that  it  was  directed against  leading  oligarchic  figures,  the  board  of  officials referred  to as  the  epimenioi  is  normally  taken  to  be  a  feature of  Milesian  oligarchy  (e.g.  ML  43;Koerner ( 1993)  311; Gorman  ( 2001)  232\u00ad34).  It  is  possible  that  the  provisions  of the  decree  were  directed  by  an  established  oligarchy  against Medising  members  of  the  Milesian  \u00e9lite. It  is  clear,  however,  that  Miletos  experienced  a  period  of civil  unrest  in  the  middle  of  C 5,  and  that  the  Athenians intervened  on  at  least  one  occasion.  [Xen].  Ath.  Pol. 3.11 refers  to  a  situation  in  which  the  Athenians  chose  to  back the  Milesian  oligarchy  against  the  demos;  the  oligarchs subsequently  revolted  and  massacred  the  demos.It  is ionia  1085 impossible  to  date  the  incident  from  [Xen.]'s  text  alone, but  it  may  be  connected  with  the  passing  of  IG i\u00b3  21  (con- ventionally  dated  to 450/49),  which  contains  Athenian  reg- ulations  for  Miletos.  An  Athenian  garrison  was  imposed  on Miletos,  but  it  cannot  be  determined  if  democracy  was  also imposed  (Gorman  ( 2001)  227\u00ad30,  contra,  e.g.,  Hornblower ( 1991)  188\u00ad89).  IG i\u00b3  21  is  normally  interpreted  as  an Athenian  attempt  to  prop  up  an  existing  oligarchy,  which may  later  have  revolted  and  instigated  the  massacre  that  led to  further  Athenian  intervention  and  the  imposition  of democracy. A  terminus  ante  quem  for  the  introduction  of  democracy at  Miletos  is  provided  by  Klio 52  ( 1970)  165\u00ad73  (dated  to  the 430s),  which  contains  regulations  for  the  sanctuary  of Poseidon  Helikonios,  and  which  carries  a  preamble  indicat- ing  the  existence  of  political  institutions  on  an  Athenian model  (see  e.g.  Rhodes,  DGS 379).  Gorman  ( 2001)  236 argues  for  the  likelihood  that  a  democracy  was  already  in place  when  the  Athenians  chose  to  back  Miletos  in  its  con- flict w ith  Samos  \"over  Priene\"  in  441/0  (Thuc. 1.115.2). In 412  the  Milesians  revolted  against  Athens  (Thuc. 8.17.1\u00ad4),  but  the  democratic  constitution  remained  in  place until 405,  when  it  was  replaced  by  an  oligarchy  (Diod. 13.104.5;Plut.  Lys. 8).  In  411  the  Milesians  countered  an Athenian  attack  on  their  city  with  a  force  consisting  of 800 hoplites  (Thuc. 8.25.2),  and  further  assisted  the Peloponnesians  with  ships  (Thuc. 8.61.2)  and  infantry (Thuc. 8.79.4).  In  405  the  Spartans  helped  the  Milesian  oli- garchs  to  overthrow  the  democracy,  and  more  than  1,000 democrats  fled from M iletos  and  were  resettled  in  Blaundos in  Lydia  by  the  Persian  satrap  Pharnabazos  (Diod. 13.104.6: ).  Xen.  An. 1.1.7  reports  that  Tissaphernes  attacked the  pro-Spartan  party  in  the  city  because  he  feared  that  they might  support  Kyros,  killing  and  exiling  most  of  them.  From LSAM 45  (  SGDI 5496  ( 380/79))  it  may  be  inferred  that  the rule  of  the  pro-Spartan  oligarchs  was  replaced  by  a  democ- racy  possibly  as  a  result  of  Tissaphernes'  interference.  The preamble  of  the  law  shows  that  by  380/79  the  Milesian  polit- ical  institutions  were  set  up  on  an  Athenian  model  (Rhodes, DGS 379). In C 4m  Miletos  was  probably  ruled  by  the  Karian  dynasts, as  is  indicated  by  Milesian  coins  with  the  legends   (Hekatomnos)  and  (Maussolos)  (Gehrke,  Stasis 116  n. 12),  and  by  statues  of  the  Hekatomnids  Ada  and  Idrieus  set up  at  Delphi  by  the  Milesians  (Tod  161B).  Many of  these changes  of  constitution  took  place  as  a  consequence  of  stasis between  opposing  factions,  thus  in  452,  405  and 402 (Gehrke,  Stasis 113\u00ad17). Depending  on  the  restorations  proposed  for  the  pream- bles  of  the  decrees  Klio 52  ( 1970)  165\u00ad73  (C 5)  and  LSAM 45  SDGI 5496  ( 380/79),  the  boule  at  Miletos  seems  to  have resembled  that  of  Athens  in  its  designations  of  phylai  pre- siding  in  each  prytany.  In  LSAM 45,  the  boule  seems  to  have a  probouleumatic  function.  Hdt. 5.29  refers  to a  (C 6), and  a  Milesian  assembly  was  convened  by  the  Spartan  gen- eral  Kallikratidas  in  406  (Xen.  Hell. 1.6.8).  The  assembly  is also  attested  in  a  number  of  C 5  and  C 4  enactments:  Klio 52 ( 1970)  165\u00ad73  is  a  C 5  decree  (psephisma)  passed  by  the  city  of Miletos  concerning  the  cult  of  Poseidon  Helikionios.  LSAM 45  SDGI 5496  ( 380/79),  a  psephisma  containing  regula- tions  for  the  cult  of  Artemis,  has  in  the  preamble:  ,     ,       \u00b5,  `   ( 1\u00ad5).  Both  decrees show  very  strong  Athenian  influence (Rhodes,  DGS 379). There  is  evidence  for  homicide  legislation  in  Milet. vi.1 187.2\u00ad3  ML 43  (C 5m). Milet. i.3  122  lists  officials under the heading   \u00b5   \u00b5.  These  officials ( aisymnetai,  also called  stephanophoroi)  were  clearly  eponymous,  and  the  list went  back  to 525  (Sherk  ( 1992)  229\u00ad32;  supra).  Other  officials are  (Milet. i.3135.36\u00ad37  Syll. \u00b3273  (C 4); (Milet. i.3135.30\u00ad31  (C 4)); \u00b5  (Milet. i.3 135.31); \u00b5  (Milet. vi.1  187.5  ML 43  (C 5m)); (LSAM 45.11  SDGI 5496  ( 380/79));  and  a \u00b5\u00b5,  perhaps  of  the  boule  (Klio 52  ( 1970)  165\u00ad73 ( 435/4)). The  Milesian  citizen  population  was  subdivided  into  two different  sets  of  phylai.  Of  the  six  old  Attic-Ionic  phylai,  four are  attested  in  C 5  sources:  the  Oinopes,  the  Hoplethes,  the Boreis  and  the  Argadeis  (Syll. \u00b357.1\u00ad3;  PEP  Miletos 419,  420), and  the  existence  of  the  Geleontes  and  Aigikoreis  can  be  pre- sumed  (Jones,  POAG 321).A  different  system  of  at  least  nine and  possibly  twelve  phylai  is  attested  in  sources,  some  of which  date  from  C 4  and  one  even  from  437/6  (Herrmann ( 1970)).  At  least  seven  phylai  duplicate  the  Kleisthenic  ones: Aiantis,  Akamantis,  Erechtheis,  Kekropis,  Leontis,  Oineis and  Pandionis.  The  two  other  known  phylai  are  Asopis  and Theseis  (Jones,  POAG 322\u00ad23).  Inscriptions  of  C 3\u00adC1  testify to  at  least  five and perhaps seven demes,  of  which  three  are the  Argaseis,  the  Lerioi  and  the  Teichiesseis  (supra 1083; Jones,  POAG 323\u00ad25). Milesian  embassies  are  attested  in  Thuc. 1.115.2  (to Athens, 441/40)  and  Thuc. 8.85.4  (to  Sparta, 411).  Proxenia was  received  from  Knidos  (no. 903)  (I.Knidos 1.1\u00ad3 ( 400\u00ad350))  and  from  Tanagra  (no. 220)(IG  vii  524 (C 4l/C3e)).  Citizenship  was  given  to  an  individual  from 1086 rubinstein Mylasa  (no. 913)  (SEG 38  1193  ( 330\u00ad320)),  and  in  C 4  Miletos also  entered  into  mutual  arrangements  of  isopoliteia  with other  states:  Olbia  (no. 690)  (Gawantka  ( 1975)  no. 18  Tod 195  (before  323));  Kyzikos  (no. 747)  (Gawantka  ( 1975)  no. 19 (before  323))  and  Pygela  (no. 863)  (Gawantka  ( 1975)  no. 21). Milesian  theorodokoi  to  host  theoroi  from  Argos  (no. 347)  are attested  in  SEG 23  189.ii.12  ( 330\u00ad324). Since  the  Geometric  period,  Kalabaktepe,  a  57  m-high  hill to  the  south  of  Miletos,  was  defended  and  acted  as  an  acrop- olis  for  the  city  (Milet. i.8;von Graeve ( 1986),  ( 1987),  ( 1990), ( 1991),  ( 1992),  ( 1995),  ( 1997),  ( 1999)).  Kaletepe  (the  Theatre Hill)  has  also  been  suggested  as  a  possible  acropolis  for  the ancient  city,  but  here  the  archaeological  evidence  has  been obscured  by  a  Byzantine  castle.  Following  the  destruction  of the  city  in  494  there  was  significant r ebuilding  on Kalabaktepe,  but  it  was  later  abandoned  as  the  city  never grew  to  regain  its  former  size,  and  the  focus  of  settlement shifted  towards  the  harbours. In  connection  with  his  report  of  Alyattes'  attack  on Miletos  (C 7),  Hdt. 1.17  comments  that,  because  of  Miletos' control  of  the  sea,  a  proper  siege  could  not  be  undertaken  by an  army.  The  Persian  siege  of  Miletos  after  the  battle  of  Lade was  from  land  and  sea  (Hdt. 6.18).  The  city  walls  are  mentioned  in  Hdt. 6.7  and 6.18.  Their  extent  in  the  Archaic period  is  much  debated  (Milet. i.8,  ii.3;  and  Cobet  ( 1997)); but  Kalabaktepe  appears  to  have  been  encircled  with  walls, and  on  its  summit  a  second,  inner  wall  has  recently  been found  (Senff  et al.( 1997)).  Whether  the  Archaic  walls extended  on  to  the  plain  below  Kalabaktepe  to  enclose  the whole  peninsula  is  not  yet  clear  (Cobet  ( 1997)).  Excavation of  the  area  between  Kalabaktepe  and  the  Sacred  Gate  area  is hampered  by  the  great  depth  of  deposits  that  overlie  the ancient  remains.  Some  or  all  of  the  lower  city  may  have  been enclosed  within  the  city  walls  to  defend  the  harbour  area and  secure  its  sea  power  (Lang  ( 1996)  199\u00ad201);  the  city  was besieged  and  taken  by  Alexander  the  Great  in  334  (Diod. 17.22.1\u00ad4). In  Hdt. 1.17  and 1.21  the  asty  is  referred  to explicitly. According  to  Hdt. 1.17.2,  there  was  also  significant settle- ment  outside  the  Archaic  urban  centre.  Archaic  Miletos appears  to  have  covered  a  very  large  area,  perhaps  as  much  as 110  ha  (M\u00fcller-Wiener  ( 1986)  98),  but  this  area  cannot  have been  covered  by  contiguous  urban  settlement.  Trial  trench- ing  on  the  plains  between  Kalabaktepe  and  the  temple  of Athena  found  limited  evidence  for  Archaic  settlement  here (Milet. i.839ff),  and  the  archaeology  in  other  parts  of  the city  is  obscured  by  later  buildings.  Thus,  the  estimate  of about 4,000  houses  in  the  early  Archaic  town  (Gates  ( 1995) 238)  must  be  an  exaggeration  (Hansen  ( 2000)  179  n. 208). The  period  494  to 479  is  virtually  unattested  in  the  archaeo- logical  record;  but  when  the  town  was  rebuilt,  the  walls  were probably  planned  on  the  same  scale  and  in  the  same  location as  the  original  Archaic  city  to  enclose  the  city  peninsula  and Kalabaktepe.  The  new  city  was  grid-planned  and  is  pre- sumed  to  have  covered  most  of  the  area  between Kalabaktepe  and  Humeitepe  (Hoepfner  and  Schwandner ( 1994)  17\u00ad19). A  Milesian  agora  is  attested  in  Hdt. 1.21  (rC 7\u00adC6)  and Diod. 13.104.5  (r 405).  Milet. i.3135.29\u00ad30  mentions  a  sanctu- ary  of  Apollo.  In  a  decree  passed  by  the  city  of  Miletos  con- cerning  the  cult  of  Poseidon  Helikionios,  there  is  mention  of the  temenos  (Klio 52  ( 1970)  165\u00ad73,ll.  31\u00ad32).  The  Athena temple  in  the  western  part  of  the  peninsula  dates  back  to  C 7, with  rebuilding  work  in  C 6,  and  there  is  evidence  that Delphinion  near  the  Lion  Bay  had  been  situated  there  since the  Archaic  period.  A  C 4  Dionysos  temple  had  a  C 6  prede- cessor.  A  summary  of  the  finds r elating  to  the  public  archi- tecture  of  Archaic  Miletos  is  provided  by  Lang  ( 1996) 198\u00ad99. There  is  no  Archaic  or  Classical  evidence  for  a  cult  of Athena  Polias,  but  Herrmann  ( 1971)  293\u00ad94  infers  from  an inscription  of  the  second  or  third  century  ad  mentioning Athena  Polias  that  she  was  identical  with  the  goddess  wor- shipped  in  the  Athena  temple,  attested  without  epithet already  in  the  Archaic  period.  In  a  decree  of  C 5  the  assembly regulates  the  cult  of  Poseidon  Helikionios  (Klio 52  ( 1970) 165\u00ad73).  An  oracular  response  of  c. 500  very  likely  records  a communal  Milesian  consultation  at  the  oracle  at  Didyma (Milet. i.3178;  Somolinos  ( 1991);  Herrmann  ( 1992)  116\u00ad17). The  oracle  of  Apollo  at  Didyma  was  presumably  involved  in the  Milesian  foundation  of  Olbia  (no. 690);  cf.  the  bone tablet  of  c. 525\u00ad500  found  at  Berezan  (SEG 36  694),  face  B  of which  contains  the  inscription:  (\u00b5) (Rusyayeva  ( 1986)). For  the  Milesian  calendar,  see  Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 89\u00ad93.Five months  are  identical  with  the  Athenian.  Two  of  the  Milesian months  are  attested  in  Classical  sources:  Taureon  (Klio 52 ( 1970)  165\u00ad73,l.  31  (C 5))  and  Artemision  (LSAM 45  SDGI 5496  ( 380/79)). Milesian  victors  in  the  Olympic  Games  are  Olympionikai 79  ( 596),  225  ( 472)  and  385:  Antipater  ( 388),  according  to Paus. 6.2.6,  was  the  first of  the  Ionians  to  have  dedicated  a statue  at  Olympia. Miletos  struck  coins  in  C 6\u00adC4  of  electrum,  silver  and bronze.  ( 1)  Electrum,  C 6:  types:  obv.  mostly  (head  of)  lion; rev.  incuse(s).  ( 2)  Silver,  C 6\u00adC5:  obv.  forepart  of  lion;  rev. ionia  1087 floral pattern w ithin  incuse  square.  ( 3)  Silver,  C 5:  obv.  lion; rev.  floral ornament.  ( 4)  Silver,  C 4:  obv.  Apollo  laureate;  rev. lion;  legend: monogram  and  magistrate's  name.  ( 5) Bronze,  C 4:  obv.  lion  walking,  monogram;  rev.  star;  legend: magistrate's  name;  or  obv.  Apollo  laureate;  rev.  lion  and  star; legend: as  monogram  or  and  magis- trate's  name.  Milesian  silver  obols  dating  from  510\u00ad494  were found  in  the  Asyut  hoard  (Price  and  Waggoner  ( 1975)  86; Jenkins  ( 1990)  16).  In  BMC  Ionia 183\u00ad91  and  Babelon,  Trait\u00e9 ii. 2.1047  it  is  assumed  that  there  is  a  gap  in  the  minting  of  sil- ver  and  electrum  coinage  between  494  and 478,  but  this seems  to  rest  entirely  on  the  assumption  that  no  coins  were minted  in  the  first decade and a half  after  the  destruction  of the  city  (Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 1.  11\u00ad54,  266\u00ad71,  ii. 2.  1047\u00ad55; Head,  HN \u00b2584\u00ad86;  SNG  Cop.  Ionia 943\u00ad77). Miletos  was  exceptionally  active  as  a  coloniser,  and  is reported  or  assumed  to  have  been  involved  in  the  founda- tion  or  refoundation  of  the  following  colonies:  Leros  (no. 504)  in  C 6?;  Ikaros  at  an  unknown  date  (see  p. 740);  Therma (no. 481)  at  an  unknown  date;  Myrkinos  (no. 633)  in  497; Kardia  (no. 665)  in  collaboration  with  Klazomenai  (no. 847) at  an  unknown  date;  Limnai  (no. 668)  at  an  unknown  date; Apollonia  (no. 682)  c. 610;  Bizone  (no. 683)  in  C 6; Dionysopolis  (no. 684)  in  C 6l\u00adC5;  Istros  (no. 685)  in  657; Odessos  (no. 689)  in  585\u00ad575;  Olbia  (no. 690)  in  647/6; Tomoi  (no. 693)  in  C 6;  Tyras  (no. 694)  in  C 6;  Kepoi  (no. 699) in 580\u00ad570;  Nymphaion  (no. 704)  in  560s;  Pantikapaion  (no. 705)  in  575;  Theodosia  (no. 707)  c. 570;  Dioskourias  (no. 709) in  C 6m;  Phasis  (no. 711)  in  C 6\u00adC5;  Amisos  (no. 712)  c. 560 (possibly  with  Phokaia  (no. 859));  Kromna  (no. 723)  at  an unknown  date;  Kytoros  (no. 724)  at  an  unknown  date; Sesamos  (no. 728)  at  an  unknown  date;  Sinope  (no. 729)  in C 7l;  Tieion  (no. 733)  at  an  unknown  date;  Artake  (no. 736)  in C 6?;  Daskyleion  (no. 740)  at  an  unknown  date;  Kios  (no. 736)  in  626/5;Kyzikos  (no. 747)  in  679;Miletoupolis  (no. 750) in  C 7l/C6e;  Paisos  (no. 755)  in  C 7;  Priapos  (no. 758)  in  C 7e; Prokonnesos  (no. 759)  in  C 7e;  Abydos  (no. 765)  in  C 7e; Arisbe  (no. 768)  at  an  unknown  date;  Skepsis  (no. 792)  in C 5e.  See  also  Ehrhardt  ( 1983)  and  Gorman  ( 2001)  243\u00ad58.In C 4  the  citizens  of  Olbia  were  granted  ateleia  in  Miletos  by mutual  arrangement  (Tod  195.21\u00ad22;  cf.  Graham  ( 1964) 99\u00ad103). 855. ", "Thebai": "Identifier: 1103, (Thebaios) Map  61.  Lat. 37.40,long.  27.10. Size of  territory: 1  or 2.  Type:  B.  The  toponym  is  ,   (I.Priene 37.57;  Theopomp.  fr. 23).  The  city-ethnic  is (I.Priene 361.4  (C 4m)  attesting  to the  collective and,  probably,  external  use).  Thebai  was  located  on  Mt. Mykale. The  strongest  indications  that  Thebes  was  at  some  point  a polis  are  the  attestations  of  an  altar  of  Zeus  Polieus  located  in the  sanctuary  of  Athena  (I.Priene 364.12\u00ad14  (C 3l?))  and  of the  collective,  internal  use  of  the  city-ethnic  (I.Priene 361.4 (C 4m),  362.26  (C 4m)),  with  the  clear  implication  in  I.Priene 362.26  that  the  Thebans  retained  a  communal  identity  dis- tinct  from  that  of  the  citizens  of  Miletos  (no. 854),  and  of  a clearly  demarcated  Theban  territory.  The  latter  had  com- mon  borders  with  the  territory of  Priene  (no. 861)  (I.Priene 363.24\u00ad25).By  C 3,however,the  community  had  the  status  of a  Milesian  deme  (I.Priene 364.8;  for  grants  of  ateleia  at  deme level,  see  Whitehead  ( 1986)  82  on  Eleusis).  According  to I.Priene 37.57\u00ad58,  it  was  given  to  Samos  (no. 864)  by  Miletos, who  had  received  it  after  the  Meliac  War  (cf.  Theopomp.  fr. 23).  However,  on  Hiller  von  Gaertringen's interpretation ( 1906)  185,  Miletos  received  Thebes  from  Samos  in  return for  another  site.  In  any  case,  I.Priene 363.22\u00ad23  shows  that Thebai  was  no  longer  part  of  the  Samian  peraia  in  C 4m;  but that  does  not  necessarily  confirm v on  Gaertringen's  inter- pretation,  for  it  is  highly  doubtful  whether  the  Athenian  set- tlers  in  Samos  from  365  to 322  exercised  any  control  at  all over  its  former  peraia.  The  designation  of  the  boundaries  of Theban  territory  was  carried  out  by  an  individual  appoint- ed  to the  task  by election  (I.Priene 361.1\u00ad2),  but  we do  not know  which  community  was  responsible  for  the  appoint- ment.  The  stephanephoros  in  I.Priene 364.1  (C 3l?)  was  very likely  Milesian  rather  than  Theban.  I.Priene 365  (C 4)  was  set up  by  the  phrourarch  Ameinias,  son  of  Themistokles.  Hiller von  Gaertringen  assumed  that  he  was  a  Milesian  official (for which  the  archon  of  Teichioussa  may  provide  a  parallel, supra 1083),  and  that  Thebes  itself  was  a  Milesian  phrourion in  C 4. The  city  wall  of  Thebes  was  dated  on  stylistic  grounds  to the  Archaic  period  by  Wiegand  and  Schrader  ( 1904)  474, whose  excavations  also  uncovered  two  temples  and  a  habit- ation  area.  The  bronze  coins  found  on  the  site  were  pre- dominantly  Milesian,  dating  from  the  early  Hellenistic period. 1102 rubinstein Several  cult  sites  are  attested  epigraphically.  In  addition  to the  Athena  sanctuary,  Theban  territory  contained  cult  sites of  Hermes  Ktenites  (I.Priene 361.4  and 362.9),  Mykale (I.Priene 362.7),  Nymphs  (I.Priene 362.7),  Maiandros (I.Priene 362.11)  and  Hekate  (I.Priene 363.20\u00ad21).  I.Priene 362.8  mentions  the  festival  Targelia  (sic).  The  names  of  the months  Kyanopsion  (I.Priene 362.2)  and  Ta[u]reon (I.Priene 362.6)  in  the  Theban  calendar  are  attested  both  in Samos  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 78),  Miletos  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 89\u00ad93)  and  Priene  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 94\u00ad96),  and  Milesian control  of  Thebes  did  not  necessarily  imply  that  the  latter's calendar  was  changed  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 94). ionia  1103", "Priene": "Identifier: 864. , underwent  andrapodismos  in 546  (Hdt. 1.161),  but had  been  re-established  as  a  community  by  495/4  at  the  lat- est,  when  it  contributed  twelve  ships  to  the  battle  of  Lade (Hdt. 6.8.1).  Priene  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Ionian  district  and  is  recorded  from  454/3 (IG i\u00b3  259.ii.11)  to  442/1  (IG i\u00b3  270.i.21,  completely  restored) a  total  of  eight  times,  once  completely  restored,  paying  a phoros  of 1  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  263.v.22).It  is  absent  from  the  full  panel of 440/39  (IG i\u00b3  272.i\u00adii.7\u00ad25).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.149).  The  polis  may  have  been  regarded  as  a potential  dependency  by  both  Miletos  and  Samos,  whose fight for domination gave r ise  to  a  war  and  subsequent Athenian  intervention  on  Samos  in  440/39  (Thuc. 1.115.2).In 398/7  troops  from  Priene  assisted  Derkylidas  in  his  campaign  in  the  Maiandros  plain  (Xen.  Hell. 3.2.17),  and  the latest  secure  reference  to the  urban  centre of  Priene  is  found in  Xen.  Hell. 4.8.17,  referring  to Thibron's  movements  in  the Maiandros  plain  in  391/90. It  is  normally  assumed  that  after  this  point  the  Prienian citizens  abandoned  their  original  (and  still  unlocated) urban  centre  in  favour  of  the  harbour  town  of  Naulochon until  the  refoundation  of  Hellenistic  Priene  (Hiller  von Gaertringen  ( 1906)  xi).  The  question  of  refoundation  and urban  relocation,  however,  is  subject  to  continuous  debate. The  dates  suggested  for  the  refoundation  of  Priene  vary from  C 4m  (implying  Athenian  or  Hekatomnid  involve- ment)  to 334  (van  Berchem  ( 1970);  Hornblower  ( 1982a) 326\u00ad28;  Schipporeit  ( 1998)).  On  a  priori  topographical grounds  it  would  be  very  surprising  if  Archaic  and  Classical Priene  was  not  located  on  the  same  site  as  the  Hellenistic city.  If  there  was  a  separate  site,  one  would  have  expected some  trace  of  it  to  have  been  identified or noticed.  Demand ( 1990)  140\u00ad46  presents  important  arguments  against  a  relo- cation  and  maintains  that  there  is  evidence  for  continuous occupation  throughout  C 4  on  the  site  of  Hellenistic  Priene. Botermann  ( 1994)  165  has  refuted  some  of  Demand's  argu- ments,  assuming  a  refoundation  by  Alexander  the  Great while  still  following  Demand  in  suggesting  that  the  urban centre  was  not  necessarily  relocated.  Botermann's  argument rests  primarily  on  the  lack  of  epigraphical  material  antedat- ing 334;  but  this  point  could  be  made  for  most  of  the  Aiolic and  Ionian  poleis  of  Asia  Minor  and  thus  is  not  conclusive. Schipporeit  ( 1998)  adduced  further  arguments  in  favour  of Demand's  position  by  drawing  attention  to  remains  of  older constructions  at  the  site  of  the  Demeter  sanctuary,  the  ori- entation  of  which  does  not  agree  with  that  of  the  late Classical  temple  (( 1998)  195\u00ad96).  Furthermore, as Schipporeit  points  out  (ibid. 202\u00ad3),  only  about  a  third  of Priene  has  been  excavated  so  far,  and  this  supports Demand's  warning  against  arguments  from  silence  regard- ing  the  existence  of  an  earlier  settlement  on  the  site. Naulochon  (no. 857)  rather  than  Priene  figures in a list of theorodokoi  to  host  theoroi  from  Argos  (no. 347)  (SEG 23 189.ii.10  ( 330\u00ad324));  but  the  date  of  the  inscription  after Alexander's  instructions  regarding  Naulochon  (I.Priene 1) weakens  the  text  as  evidence  against  the  existence  of  Priene in  C 4e\u00adm.I.Priene  5.10\u00ad13  (before  326/5,and  so  roughly  con- temporary  with  the  list  of  theorodokoi)  prescribes  that  theo- roi  elected  by  the  Prienian  demos  are  to  be  dispatched  to Athens  in  connection  with  the  Panathenaia. Nothing  is  known  about  the  constitution  of  Priene before 334,  and  I.Priene 3,  4,  6,  7  and 8  are  insecurely  dated and  may  belong  in  C 3e(Crowther(1996)).  During  the  last three  decades  of  C 4  Priene  appears  to  have  been  governed by  some  form  of  democracy.  The  decree  I.Priene 2.3  ( 334) mentions  an  assembly  meeting  ( ). I.Priene 9.4  (C 4)  mentions  the  boule,  and  its  probouleu- matic  function  is  securely  attested  in  I.Priene 4.52 ( [ ]  []  [ ] \u00b5  ( 332\u00ad324)), but  the  other  attestations  of  this  function  in  C 4  inscrip- tions  (I.Priene 2.1  and 5.1)  are  entirely  due  to  Hiller  von Gaertringen's  not  very  reliable  restorations.  The  epony- mous  official  is  designated  prytanis  in  I.Priene 2.4  ( 334).  For the  title  of  stephanephoros  in  I.Priene 4  ( 332\u00ad324),  see 1092 rubinstein Crowther  ( 1996)  205\u00ad6.  The  following  types  of  official  are attested  epigraphically:  a  grammateus  elected  by  the  assem- bly  (I.Priene 4.6,  commending  the 20-year  tenure  of  this position  by  Apellis  and  thus  going  back  at  least  as  far  as  the last  two  decades  of  C 4)  and  a  board  of  timouchoi  (I.Priene 10.24).  I.Priene 10  refers  to  the  Prienian  administration  of justice,  which  provided  for  public  actions  brought  by  vol- unteer  prosecutors  (l. 33).  A  grant  of  proxenia  bestowed  on Antigonos  of  Makedonia,  who  is  also  given  citizenship,  is attested  in  I.Priene 2  ( 334).  Shortly  before 322  Priene renewed  a  block  grant  of  citizenship  bestowed  on  the Athenians  (I.Priene 5.7\u00ad8;  see  also  IG ii\u00b2  566.7\u00ad8,presum- ably  referring  to  the  earlier  grant). A  grant  of  enktesis  ges  kai  oikias  is  bestowed  on Antigonos  of  Makedonia  in  I.Priene 2.9.  A  distinction between  real  property  owned  by  the  citizens  of  Priene  and property  owned  by  resident  non-Prienians  in  Prienian  ter- ritory  is  made  in  I.Priene 1.8\u00ad13,  with  a  view  to  taxation imposed  by  Alexander  the  Great.  Import  and  export  taxes are  mentioned  in  I.Priene 2.9\u00ad11,  aswellasageneralgrant of  ateleia,  but  excepting  taxes  on  land,  which  will  still  have to  be  paid  by  the  honorand.  On  personal  taxation  in Priene,  see  Gauthier  ( 1991),  who  relies  on  Hiller  von Gaertringen's  early  dates  for  I.Priene 4,  and  whose  other Prienian  evidence  all  belongs  to  C 3  or  later.  Maronitai  resi- dent  in  Priene  are  mentioned  in  I.Priene 10.21,a  C 4  decree bestowing  various  judicial  privileges  on  citizens  of Maroneia  (no. 646).  Evidence  for  a  group  of  land-owning, permanent  non-Prienian  residents  designated  Pedieis  is found  in  I.Priene 1.7\u00ad13  and  later  in  I.Priene 3  (C 3eaccord- ing  to  Crowther).  There  is  a  possibility  that  Pedieis  refers  to non-Greek  residents  in  Prienian  territory  (Corsaro  ( 1984)); but  this  proposition  has  been  questioned  by  Schuler ( 1998)  205. The  urban  centre  of  Priene  was  surrounded  by  walls which  can  be  dated  to C 4,  although  their  precise  date  is  dis- puted  (Wiegand  and  Schrader  ( 1904)  35ff;  Lawrence  ( 1979) 119,  478);  they  enclosed  an  area  of 37  ha,  of  which  15  ha  was suitable  for  habitation  (Hoepfner  and  Schwandner  ( 1994) 193)  and  accommodated  c. 500  houses  (ibid.  ( 1994)  190).  The agora  of  C 4  Priene  is  currently  under  investigation  (Gates ( 1994)  269).  The  main  sanctuary  was  that  of  Athena  Polias (I.Priene  156:             (c. 334,  but  the  date  is  disputed;  see Carter  ( 1988)  133  n. 59)  and  Botermann  ( 1994)  162)).  The  C 4 temple  of  Athena  was  probably  not  completed  until  C 3 (Mellink  ( 1993)  126\u00ad27);  there  can  be  no  doubt,  however, that  the  construction  of  the  temple  was  begun  in  the  330s  at the  latest.  The  Demeter  sanctuary,  which  may  contain remains  predating  the  refoundation  of  the  city,  is  discussed by  Schipporeit  ( 1998).  For  the  date  of  the  theatre  (TGR  iii. 441\u00ad42),  see  Gogos  ( 1998),  who  argues  for  a  date  not  earlier than  C 3  for  the  entire  structure.  With  Crowther's  redating  of I.Priene 4  to C 3e,  the  only  written  evidence  for  a  C 4  theatre disappears  ( 32).  This  is  also  true  of  the  references  to a  pry- taneion  in  I.Priene 3.16  and 4.35\u00ad36.  A  grid  plan  is  attested from  at  least  C 4  (Hoepfner  and  Schwandner  ( 1994) 188\u00ad222). The  Prienian  calendar  shows  close  affinities w ith  that  of Miletos  (no. 854)  and  two  of  the  Attic  months  are  attested  in C 4  inscriptions:  Metageitnion  in  I.Priene 2.2  and Boedromion  in  I.Priene 10.1\u00ad2  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 94\u00ad96  \u00a7 83). Prienian  bronze  coinage  is  known  from  at  least  as  early  as C 4m.  ( 1)  Types:  obv.

Head,  HN \u00b2  590  drew  attention  to  the  similarity  between  ( 2) and  the  types  minted  by  Naulochon  (no. 857).  Regling's ( 1927)  reluctance  to  date  any  Prienian  issues  to  the  period before  C 4m  has  been  questioned  by  Schipporeit  ( 1998).SNG von  Aulock 2151  and  SNG  Cop.  Ionia 1076  (bronze)  are  dated to 340\u00ad334.  Coins  of  C 2  have  the  full  form  of  the  city-ethnic: (SNG  Cop.  Ionia 1100). 862.Pteleon  (Pteleousios) Map  56.  Lat. 38.30,long.  26.25. Size  of  territory:  unknown but  probably  1  or 2.  Type:  B.  The toponym is ,  (Thuc. 8.24.2,  31.2).  The  city- ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  264.iii.30  ( 448/7);  Eust.  Il. 297.28).  The  settlement  is  designated  as  a  teichos  in  Thuc. 8.24.2,  but  this  designation  does  not  rule  out  that  Pteleon was  a  polis.  The  collective  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic is  attested  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists. Pteleon  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Ionian  district  and  is  recorded  from  450/49  (IG i\u00b3 263.ii.16)  to  430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.i.21)  a  total  of  ten  times,  three times  completely  but  plausibly  restored.  In  430/29  Pteleon  is explictly  recorded  as  a  dependency  of  Erythrai  (IG i\u00b3 281.i.20).  In  450/49,  448/7  and 447/6  Pteleon  paid  alongside the  other  dependencies  of  Erythrai  (no. 845);  they  all formed  a  syntely,  but  the  Pteleousioi  paid  on  their  own behalf  (IG i\u00b3  263.ii.16,264.iii.30,265.i.64).In  later  years  their payment  is  recorded  separately  from  that  of  the  other Erythraian  dependencies,  and  they  seem  in  all  years  to  have paid 100  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  272.ii.20).  In  425/4  Pteleon  was  assessed for  tribute  separately  from  Erythrai  and  the  other Erythraian  dependencies  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.93). ionia  1093 The  community  was  located  in  Erythraian  territory  and was  undoubtedly  an  Erythraian  dependency  (Thuc. 8.24.2:   ';IG  i\u00b3  281.i.21:[ ]  '), but  the  Athenians  maintained  control  over  the  site  during Erythrai's  revolt  in  412.  The  designation  in  Thuc. 8.24.2  indicates  that  Pteleon  was  walled;  see  also Thucydides'  report  at  8.31.2  of  Astyochos'  failure  to  capture the  site. 863.Pygela  (Pygeleus) Map  61.

Hell. 1.2.2;  SEG 23  189.ii.9 ( 330\u00ad324))  or  (I.Ephesos3110.6(C4l)).The city-eth- nic  is  (Xen.  Hell. 1.2.2)  or  (IG i\u00b3 266.i.7  ( 446/5))  or  (I.Ephesos 3110.3  (C 4l)).Pygela is  attested  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  I.Ephesos 3110 (C 4),  and  retrospectively  in  the  sense  of  town  by  Polyaen. 7.23.2  (rC 4).  The  polis  cognates  polites  and  politeia  in  the sense  of  citizenship  are  attested  in  I.Ephesos 3110.  The  collec- tive  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on  C 4  coins (infra)  and  externally  in  Xen.  Hell. 1.2.2;  IG i\u00b3  269.i.29 ( 443/2);  I.Ephesos 3110  (C 4).  For  the  individual  and  external use  of  the  city-ethnic,  see  IGBulg. 416  (C 5\u00adC4)  and  Dion. Hal.  Thuc. 5  (rC 5)  (referring  to  Thucydides'  predecessor \u00b5  ). The of  Pygela  is  mentioned  in  Xen.  Hell. 1.2.2 (r 409).  I.Ephesos 3111.11\u00ad13  (c. 310)  records  that  a  grant  of citizenship  was  passed  with 350  votes  (Gauthier  ( 1990) 91\u00ad92). Pygela  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Ionian  district  and  is  recorded  from  446/5  (IG i\u00b3  266.i.7) to 415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.i.24)  a  total  of  eleven  times,  twice  com- pletely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1  tal.  in  440/39  (IG i\u00b3 272.ii.13)  and  1  tal., 3,000  dr.  in  432/1  (IG i\u00b3  280.i.47).  It was assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.151). In C 4l  Pygela  entered  into  an  isopoliteia  agreement  with Miletos  (no. 854)  (I.Ephesos 3110)  in  which  Pygelean  envoys to  Miletos  are  honoured  ( 2).  Prior  to  the  isopoliteia  agree- ment  Milesian  citizens  resident  at  Pygela  appear  to  have enjoyed  some  form  of  limited  citizenship,  perhaps  bestowed on  them  by  a  block  grant.  Likewise,  Pygelean  citizens  resid- ent  at  Miletos  seem  to  have  had  some  privileges.  The  treaty itself  may  have  extended  the  civic  rights  of  resident Pygeleans  in  Miletos:  the  end  of  the  decree  stipulates  that  the Pygeleans  are  to  be  assigned  to  phylai  by  lot  by  the  prytaneis (ll. 17\u00ad18).  I.Ephesos 3111  (C 4l)  shows  that  in  C 4  the  Pygelean assembly  controlled  the  admission  of  new  citizens  by  decree (psephisma,l. 4). The  independence  of  Pygela  seems  to have been  under constant  threat  from  its  more  powerful  neighbours,  espe- cially  Samos  (no. 864)  and  Ephesos  (no. 844).  The  latter clearly  had  absorbed  Pygela  in  the  early  Hellenistic  period, when  the  inhabitants  of  Pygela  were referred  to as  Ephesian citizens  (I.Ephesos 1408.2,  4\u00ad5). The  civic  subdivisions  of  Pygela  were phylai  and  gene.The phyle \u00b5\u00b5  and  the  genos are  attested,  and a  board  of  prytaneis  are  given  responsibility  for  assigning naturalised  citizens  to  civic  subdivisions  by  lot  and,  togeth- er  with  the  tamias,  for  having  the  citizenship  decree inscribed  on  stone  (I.Ephesos 3111.7\u00ad9). Pygela  was  fortified in  409  (Xen.  Hell. 1.2.2).  During  exca- vations  of  the  site  between  Ephesos  and  Ku \u017esadasi,  G\u00fcr\u00e7ay and  Akurgal  cleared  40  m  of  the  city  walls.  Sherds  dating from  C 4  were  found  during  this  operation  (Mellink  ( 1976) 280).  A  sanctuary  of  Artemis  is  attested  epigraphically (I.Ephesos 3111.5\u00ad6).  Pygelean  theorodokoi  to  host  theoroi from  Argos  (no. 347)  are  attested  in  SEG 23  189.ii.9 ( 330\u00ad324). Pygela  struck  coins  of  silver  and  bronze  throughout  C 4.

In C 4  Achilleion  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  a  single source:  Xen.  Hell. 4.8.17,  where  it  is  reported  that  Thibron used  Achilleion  as  a  base  for  his  raids  against  the  territory  of the  Persian  king.  Achilleion  was  situated  in  the  Maiandros valley  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.17),and  thus  it  cannot  be  identical  with the  phrourion  near  Smyrna  referred  to in  Steph.  Byz. 158.12 (pace  Hirschfeld  ( 1894)).  According  to  Xen.  Hell. 3.2.17,in 398  Achilleion  was  in  a  position  to  supply  contingents  of  armed  forces.

Airai  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Thuc. 8.20.2)  and  in  the  political  sense  (PEP  Teos 268.7  BPW ( 1892)  739  no. 11  (C 4)).The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  internally  in  a  Teian  inscription  (PEP  Teos 235  BCH 4  ( 1880)  175\u00ad76  no. 35  (undated)),  and  on  C 4 coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  and assessment  decrees  (infra). Airai  was  undoubtedly  a  community  that  was  predomin- antly  Greek.  We  possess  no  information  relating  to  its  foun- dation;  but  Wilamowitz-M\u00f6llendorff  ( 1908)  617  inferred from  the  Greek  name  of  the  settlement  (presumably  from the  weed  ,  ) that Airai was a relatively recent foundation. Airai  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Ionian  district  and  is  recorded  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3 259.iii.25)  to  427/6  or 426/5  (IG i\u00b3  284.5)  a  total  of  fifteen times,  paying  a  phoros  of 3  tal.  down to 447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.ii.52) and  thereafter  1  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  266.i.12).It was  assessed  for  tribute in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.136).  It  revolted  in  411  (Thuc. 8.19.4),  and an  Athenian  attempt  to  reconquer  the  city  failed  (Thuc. 8.20.2).  Although  Airai  was  a  Teian  dependency  in  Strabo's day  ( 14.1.32),  there  is  no  information  relating  to  its  status  in the  Classical  period. Two  surviving  public  enactments  were  passed  by  Airai: PEP  Teos 28  \u00d6JhBeibl 15  ( 1912)  75\u00ad76  no. 15  may  be  a fragment  of  a  C 5  honorific  decree,  while  PEP  Teos 268  is  an honorific  decree  passed  in  C 4  and  our  most  important source  for  the  political  institutions  of  Airai  in  C 4:  the honorand  is  granted  privileged  access  to  the  courts ([ ]  )  and  access  ( )tothe  ekklesia  (ll. 2\u00ad3),  and  he  and  his  descendants  are  given  dining  rights  in the  prytaneion  on  public  festival  days  (ll. 9\u00ad12).  The  inscrip- tion  may  also  provide  evidence  that  there  were  free  non- citizens  resident  in  Airai  in  C 4  (ll. 4\u00ad5),  and  that  ownership of  real  property  was  restricted  to  the  citizens  of  Airai  ( 7\u00ad9). Meri\u00e7  ( 1987)  303  with  plan  2  on  p. 306  reports  on  a  survey at  the  site  (Urla).

Sidousa  is called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Hecat.  fr. 229  (Hansen ( 1997)  24\u00ad25).  Thuc. 8.24.2  refers  to  the  settlement  as  a  tei- chos  located  in  the  territory  of  Erythrai  (no. 845),perhaps  on the  Mimas  peninsula;  although  Plin.  HN 5.137  believed  that Sidousa  was  an  island.  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  quota  lists  (IG i\u00b3 265.i.61). Sidousa  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Ionian  district  and  is  recorded  from  450/49  (IG i\u00b3 263.ii.15)  to  430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.i.24)  a  total  of  ten  times,  three times  completely  but  plausibly  restored.  In  430/29  Sidousa  is explictly  registered  as  a  dependency  of  Erythrai  (IG i\u00b3 281.i.24).  In  450/49,  448/7  and 447/6  it  paid  alongside  the other  dependencies  of  Erythrai  (no. 845);  they  all  formed  a syntely,  but  the  Sidousioi  paid  on  their  own  behalf  (IG i\u00b3 263.ii.15,  264.iii.30,  265.i.61).  In  later  years  their  payment  is recorded  separately  from  that  of  the  other  Erythraian dependencies,  and  they  seem  in  all  years  to  have  paid  500  dr. (IG i\u00b3  271.i.19). The  community  was  located  in  Erythraian  territory  and was  undoubtedly  an  Erythraian  dependency  (Thuc. 8.24.2:   ';  IG i\u00b3  281.i.21:[ ] '), but  the  Athenians  maintained  control  over  the  site  during Erythrai's  revolt  in  412.  The  designation  in  Thuc. 8.24.2  indicates  that  Sidousa  was  walled. 867.Smyrna  (Smyrnaios) Map  56.  Lat. 38.25,long.  27.10. Size  of  territory:  ?  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is  \u00b5, (Mimnermos  fr. 9.6,  West;  Hdt. 1.16.2)  or  \u00b5  (Ps.- Skylax 98)  or,  later, \u00b5  (F.Delphes iii.3145.21  (C 3l)). The  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5  (Pind.  fr. 204,  Maehler;  Hdt. 1.143.3)  or,  later, \u00b5  (F.Delphes  III. 3145.3  (C 3l)). Smyrna  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Hdt. 1.150.1) and  in  the  political  sense  (Hdt. 1.149.1).  A  possible  C 4f attestation  of  Smyrna  as  a  polis  in  the  political  or  territorial sense  may  be  found  in  IG ii\u00b2  28.19  Tod 114  ( 387),  but  only if  the  very doubtful  restoration  of  [ \u00b5 ]  in  ll. 17\u00ad18 is  accepted.  The  designation  asty  is  applied  to  the  urban  centre  of  Smyrna  in  Pind.  fr. 204,  but  the  context  may  be  historical.  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested internally  on  a  C 4f  coin  (infra)  and  externally  in  Kallinos  fr. 2,  West  (C 7);  Pind.  fr. 204,  Maehler;  Hdt. 1.143.4.  For  the  individual  and  external  use,  see  IG ii\u00b2  10369,  an  Attic  C 4s sepulchral  inscription,  and  Ephor.  fr. 1,  referring  to a  con- temporary  Smyrnaian  teacher. Smyrna  was  originally  an  Aiolic  foundation  from  which the  settlers  were driven  out  by Ionian  exiles  from  Kolophon (no. 848)  (Mimnermos  fr. 9,  West;  Hdt. 1.149.1\u00ad150.2).  This probably  happened  prior  to 688  (the  date  of  the  Smyrnaian Onomastos'  victory  in  the  Olympic  Games),  when  Smyrna was  considered  Ionian  (Paus. 5.1.7).  Hdt. 1.16.2  refers  to Smyrna  as  \"founded  from  Kolophon\",  which  probably relates  to  the  Kolophonian  take-over.  The  most  likely  inter- pretation  of  Hdt. 1.143.3  is  that  the  Smyrnaians  subsequent- ly  asked  to  participate  in  the  Panionia,  but  were  refused. There  is  no  evidence  for  Smyrnaian  participation  in  the Archaic  or  Classical  periods,  nor  for  Smyrna's  interaction with  other  Greek  states. According  to Strabo  14.1.37,  Smyrna  was  inhabited  kome- don  for  about  400  years,  dating  from  the  Lydian  conquest  of the  polis  c. 585  (Hdt. 1.16.2).  The  physical  destruction  of Smyrna's  urban  centre  may  also  be  alluded  to  in  Theognis  fr. 1104,West.However,archaeological  evidence  points  to  a  later date  for  the  destruction,  viz. 545,  connected  with  the  Persian conquest  of  Ionia  (Meri\u00e7  and  Noll\u00e9  ( 1988)  230\u00ad32).  Strabo's claim  that  the  Smyrnaian  dioikismos  lasted  until  the  refoun- dation  of  Smyrna  by Alexander  the  Great  or  his  successors may  also  have  to  be  modified.  E.  Akurgal  ( 1983)  56\u00ad58  dis- cusses  architectural  remains  from  C 4  on  the  site  of  Archaic Smyrna.  See  further  Mellink  ( 1985)  563  and  Gates  ( 1994)  for results  of  later  excavations  of  C 5  and  C 4  structures.  Bing\u00f6l ( 1976\u00ad77)  dated  a  number  of  roof  tiles  found  in  the  harbour area  to  C 4,  before  the  refoundation.  On  the  other  hand, numerous  second-order  settlements  scattered  all  over Smyrnaian  territory,  some  of  them  fortified,  may  be  dated  to the  period  after  the  dioikismos.  Some  of  these  are  discussed by  Bean  ( 1955).  The  locations  mentioned  are  Belkahve  ( 6  m- thick  Archaic  wall,  ceramics  from  C 4  and  later),  Adatepe (presumed  by  Bean  to  be  a  Hellenistic  installation), Ak\u00e7akaya  (described  by  Weber  in  AM 10  ( 1885)),  also believed  by  Bean  to  be  Hellenistic  in  origin,  Akkaya  (for which  Bean  ventures  no  date),  Yamanlar  road  site  (no  date), \u00c7obanpinari  (terminus  post  quem  C 5  on  the  basis  of  ceramic surface  finds).  Meri\u00e7  and  Noll\u00e9  ( 1988)  225\u00ad26  discuss  a  forti- fied site on \u00c7atalkaya in S myrnaian  territory.  The  ceramics found  on  the  site  are  predominantly  Archaic  and  Hellenistic. According  to  Hdt. 1.150.2,  the  Aiolians  who  had  been thrown  out  of  Smyrna  by the  Kolophonians  were received and  given  citizenship  by  the  remaining  eleven  Aiolic  poleis; but  this  may  very  well  be  anachronistic.  The  same  may  be true  of  his  allegation  ( 1.150.2)  that  a  treaty  was  made between  the  Kolophonians  and  the  combined  forces  of  the Aiolian  poleis,  who  had  aided  the  original  Smyrnaians, according  to  which  the  Smyrnaians  were  allowed  to  take their  movable  property  with  them  into  their  exile. ionia  1099 As  far  as  the  public  architecture  of  Smyrna  is  concerned, an  open  square  with  wells  was  identified and dated t o  C 4  by E.  Akurgal  ( 1983)  56.  For  a  comprehensive discussion  of  the Athena  temple,  see  Cook  and  Nicholls  ( 1998),  who  regard the  structure  Temple  III  A\u00adB  (C 7)  \"as  the  local  beginnings  of wholly  monumental  temple  architecture\"  (( 1998)  198).  A late  C 7  fountain  house  was  identified and published b y  M.  Akurgal  ( 1996).According  to  him,  the  well  seems  to  have been  in  continuous  use  down  to  the  middle  of  C 4.  Another well,  dating  from  630\u00ad600,  was  excavated  and  described  by Nicholls  ( 1958\u00ad59)  58\u00ad64.  E.  Akurgal  identified what he called  the  \"high  street\"  of  Old  Smyrna,  the  so-called \"Athenastrasse\",  about  4  m  wide.  He  connected  this  with  the \"Orientalizing  settlement\"  (E.  Akurgal  ( 1983)  45).  He  also discussed  a  number  of  smaller  streets  dating  to  the  same period  (ibid. 46).  For  a  summary  of  the  discussion  of the  street  plan  of  Old  Smyrna,  see  Lang  ( 1996)  241\u00ad43. E.  Akurgal  ( 1983)  14  estimated  that  there  were  c. 500\u00ad600  houses  in  the  urban  centre  of  Old  Smyrna  in  the period  630\u00ad545,  and  that  the  settlement  housed  c. 3,000 inhabitants. The  only  written  attestation  of  the  city  wall  of  Smyrna  is found  in  Hdt. 1.150.1  in  his  account  of  how  the Kolophonians  took  advantage  of  a  Smyrnaian  Dionysos  fes- tival  outside  the  walls,  which  the  Smyrnaians  were  attend- ing.  The  Kolophonians  took  possession  of  the  urban  centre and  locked  the  gates.  The  archaeological  evidence  points  to a  date  of  the  first city wall at least as early as  750  (Wall  II);  but the  even  earlier  remains  of  Wall  I  were  interpreted  as remains  of  a  city  wall  by  Cook  and  Nicholls,  who  dated  this to c. 850.  This  date  was  later  accepted  by  E.  Akurgal  ( 1983) 25\u00ad26,  who  argued  that  a  fire in a building c omplex  dated  by him  to  875\u00ad825  affected  the  neighbouring  city  wall.  For  the problems  surrounding  the  interpretation  of  Wall I,  see  Lang ( 1996)  241,  who  prefers  to  interpret  it  as  a  terrace  wall.  Wall II  appears  to  have  been  destroyed  by  an  earthquake  c. 700 and  was  replaced  by  city  wall  III  in  C 7l.  Akurgal  argued  for considerable  damage  having  been  inflicted on city wall III under  Alyattes,  and  for  the  city's  being  unfortified in C 6 (( 1983)  54). The  occupation  of  the  urban  centre  of  Smyrna  goes  back at  least  as  far  as  1050,  according  to E.  Akurgal  ( 1983)  15\u00ad59, who  argues  for  an  Aiolic  phase  running  from  1050  to 1000  on the  basis  of  ceramic  finds (Aiolian g rey  ware),  found  togeth- er  with  Protogeometric  and  Geometric  decorated  sherds.  In contexts  of  the  late  Geometric  period,  the  amount  of  grey ware  increases  (ibid. 15).  There  are  very  few  architectural remains  dating  from  this  phase,  but  Akurgal  mentions  a number  of  square  buildings  (ibid. 22).  The  next  phase  is  the Protogeometric  settlement,  running  from  1000  to 875.An \"Ovalhaus\"  is  dated  to  925\u00ad900  on  the  basis  of  ceramic  finds (ibid. 17\u00ad18).  Early  Protogeometric  ceramic  is  interpreted  as evidence  for  an  Ionian  take-over  of  Smyrna  (ibid. 10\u00ad21). The  third  phase,  the  early  and  middle  Geometric  settlement, runs  from  875  to 825  (ibid. 22\u00ad27).  Akurgal  interprets  rich architectural  remains  from  this  period  as  part  of  a  large housing  complex  (ibid. 24\u00ad25).  Phase  four,  the  late Geometric  settlement,  runs  from  750  to 675/650. Architectural  finds include a tholos  (ibid. 28),  a  large  build- ing  complex  (ibid. 29)  and  a  house  with  two  rooms  and  an ante-room.  Not  much  evidence,  apart  from  ceramic  finds, remains  from  what  Akurgal  designates  the  sub-Geometric settlement, 675\u00ad640  (ibid. 34),  but  finds increase in the next stratum,  the  Orientalising  settlement  ( 640\u00ad600),  sum- marised  ibid. 35\u00ad50.  Architectural  finds include a double megaron  building,  the  oinochoe  house,  perhaps  with  towers. Another  building  complex  included  a  bath  dating  from  the last  third  of  C 7  (ibid. 39\u00ad40).  The  Archaic  settlement  (C 6) follows  (ibid. 50\u00ad56)  with  a  number  of  architectural remains,  along  with  attested  repairs  to  older  large  buildings, such  as  the  megaron  house.  For  a  summary  and  some  critical remarks  on  Akurgal's  reconstruction;  see  Lang  ( 1996) 241\u00ad43.  There  can  be  little  doubt,  however,  that  the  urbani- sation  of  Smyrna  was  very  early  (C 8  at  the  latest:  Lang  ( 1996) 242\u00ad43). There  was  not  much  C 5  material  available  in  1983 (E.  Akurgal  ( 1983)  53);  but  this  may  have  been  due  to  incom- plete  excavation,  rather  than  to  absence  of  habitation  in  this period.  Akurgal  notes  plenty  of  ceramic  finds.  There  are considerable  architectural  remains  from  C 4  (ibid. 56\u00ad58).  In the 1990s  excavations  uncovered  a  quite  dense  C 4  settlement (see  the  reports  in  Gates  ( 1994),  ( 1996)).  The  city  seems  to have  been  abandoned  at  the  end  of  C 4  (E.Akurgal  ( 1983)  58), but  Cook  and  Nicholls  ( 1998)  183  note  that  a  small  settlement  west  of  the  tell  seems  to  have  had  continued occupation  into  the  Hellenistic  period. Apart  from  the  Dionysia  mentioned  by  Hdt. 1.150.1,noth- ing  is  known  of  Smyrnaian  festivals.  In  addition  to Onomastos  mentioned  above,  a  further  Smyrnaian  victor  at the  Olympic  Games,  allegedly  the  first of  the  Ionians,  is mentioned  in  Paus. 6.13.6  (Olympionikai 29). Smyrna  struck  electrum  coins  in  C 6f.  Denominations: stater,  hekte  and  fractions  down  to  one-forty-eighth.  Types: obv.  lion's  head;  rev.  rough  incuse  square  (Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 1 nos. 177\u00ad89;Head,  HN \u00b2  591;  BMC  Ionia 236).A  unique  silver tetradrachm  on  the  Rhodian  standard  has  been  dated  to 1100 rubinstein C 4f:  obv.  head  of  Apollo,  laureate;  rev.  lyre  in  slightly  con- cave  field;  legend: .Head,  HN \u00b2  592  inter- preted  the  coin  as  evidence  for  the  existence  of  Smyrna  prior to  its  late  C 4  refoundation  and  relocation,  an  assumption that  now  seems  to  be  confirmed b y  the  archaeological  evi- dence  for  the  C 4  settlement. 868.Teos(Teios)  Map 56.Lat.38.05,long.26.45.Size  of  ter- ritory:  unknown but  probably  3  or 4.Type:A.The  toponym  is ,  (Hdt. 1.142.3;  Thuc. 8.16.1;  Ps.-Skylax 98).An alterna- tive toponym, \u00b5,  is  attested  in  Anac.  fr. 142,  Gentili. The  city-ethnic  is  (ML 7b  (C 6e);  PEP  Teos 39  SEG 2 579.1  (C 4l);  Hdt. 1.168)  or  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.127  ( 425/4)).  Teos is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (ML  30.B.12\u00ad13 (c. 470);  Thuc. 8.16.3;Aen.Tact.  18.15,  19;  Ps.-Skylax 98)  and  in the  political  sense  (SEG 31  985.18  (C 5f)  Nomima i105;  Hdt. 2.178.2;Aen.Tact.  18.13).  The  designation  patris  is  applied  to Teos  in  Hdt. 1.169.1.  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  internally  on  C 4  coins  (infra)  and  in  inscriptions (ML 30.2\u00ad3  (c. 470);  SEG 2579.1  (C 4l))  and  externally  in  Hdt. 6.8.1;  Thuc. 8.16.3;  and  IG i\u00b3  71.i.127.

If  Ager's ( 1991)  interpretation  of  SEG 28  697.10  (C 4l)  is  fol- lowed  (  Ager ( 1996)  no. 15),  this  inscription  defined the entire  territories  of  Teos  and  Klazomenai  (no. 847),  starting from  the  border  of  Kolophonia  in  the  east  and  moving  west- wards  on  to  the  isthmus  of  the  Mimas  peninsula  to  the  terri- tory  of  Erythrai  (no. 845).  For  some  objections,  see  Brixhe, BE  ( 1992)  498\u00ad99.  PEP  Teos 135  (Classical)  may  be  a  horos demarcating  Teian  territory:  [  ?] (cf.  SEG 2 598). In C 4l  there  were  600  wealthy  Teian  citizens  (euporountes) subject  to proeisphora  (Syll. \u00b3344.116),  and  Gauthier  ( 1990)  86 infers  that  the  total  number  of  citizens  must  have  come  to  at least 2,000\u00ad3,000. According  to  Pherekydes  (FGrHist 3)  fr. 102,  Teos  was founded  by  Athamas.  It  was  part  of  the  Ionian  dodekapolis (Hdt. 1.142.3)  and  was  considered  the  central  point  of  Ionia (Hdt. 1.170.3).  When  the  city  was  conquered  by  the  Persians c. 544,  all  Teians  left  for  Thrace  and  founded  Abdera  (no. 640)  (Hdt. 1.168;  Ps.-Skymnos  670\u00ad71;  SEG 47  1646B.1\u00ad2 (C 2);  Strabo  14.1.30;  see  Demand  ( 1990)  39),  but  some returned  later  (Strabo  14.1.30),  and  the  public  imprecation of 480\u00ad450  found  in  the  territory of  Teos  (SEG 31  985)  indi- cates  that,  to  some  extent,  Teos  and  Abdera  remained  two parts  of  one  polis. Teos  joined  the  Ionian  Revolt  in  499  and  provided  seven- teen  ships  for  the  battle  of  Lade  (Hdt. 6.8.1).  Teos  was  a member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the  Ionian  dis- trict  and  is  recorded  from  451/50  (IG i\u00b3  262.ii.12)  to  430/29 (IG i\u00b3  281.i.50,  mostly  restored)  a  total  of  thirteen  times, twice  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 6  tal.  It  was assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.127).In  412,she  grudg- ingly  let  in  the  forces  of  Erythrai  (no. 845)  and  Klazomenai (no. 847),  at  this  point  pro-Peloponnesian  (Thuc. 8.16.3); but  the  Athenians  seem  to  have  regained  control  before  406, when  Teos  was  sacked  by  Kallikratidas  (Diod. 13.76.4;  cf. Xen.  Hell. 1.5.15,  if  the  emendation  of '  to is accepted).  After  406 ", "Phokaia": "Identifier: 60., (Phokaieus) Map  56.  Lat. 38.40,long.  26.45. Size of  territory:  probably 3.

The  city-ethnic  is (Hdt. 4.138.2;  Thuc. 1.13.6;  IG i\u00b3  261.v.4)  or (C 4  bronze  coins,  infra).  Phokaia  is  called  a  polis both  in  the  urban  sense  (Hdt. 1.162.2\u00ad163.1;  Ps.-Skylax 98) and  in  the  political  sense  (Hdt. 2.172.2;Tod 112.6,  17;  Arist. Oec. 1348b4).  A     was  included  among the 158  Aristotelian  constitutions  (fr. 616).  The  word astos  is used  about  the  citizens  of  Phokaia  in  Hdt. 1.165,  and  patris  is used  in  Hdt. 1.169.  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  internally  on  C 4  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  Hdt. 6.8.2;  Thuc. 1.13.6;Isoc.  6.84;  IG i\u00b3  261.v.4.  For  the  individual and  external  use,  see  Hdt. 6.11.1;  CID ii  4.iii.13  (C 4m)  and  IG ii\u00b2  2421.2  (C 4). The  name  of  the  territory  was  (Thuc. 8.101.2).  It included  an  island  with  a  harbour  called  \u00b5  (Thuc. 8.101.2)  (a  harbour  is  mentioned  also  at  Ps.- Skylax 98).  Karteria  was  most  likely  (a  group  of)  island(s), and  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  even  islands  could  be described  as  part  of  Phoka\u00efs.  At  Hdt. 1.165.3  the  term   is  used  about  Phokaia's  territory  as  a  whole. The  colonisation  of  Massalia  (no. 3)  by  Phokaians  in c. 600  is  the  first thing w e  know  about  Phokaia  (supra 162, 165),  and  according  to  Thuc. 1.13.6,  Phokaia  then  possessed  a strong  naval  force.  After  the  Persian  conquest  of  the  Lydian kingdom,  the  Phokaians  decided  to  relocate  their  city  and, according  to  Hdt. 1.164,the  majority  of  the  citizens  left  c. 546. He  also  relates  that  many  of  them  became  homesick  soon after  and  returned  to  Phokaia  in  spite  of  their  solemn  oath never  to  come  back.  The  abandonment  and  destruction  of Phokaia  in  546  now  seems  to  be  confirmed archaeologically (Mitchell  ( 1999)  143). Phokaia  belonged  to  the  Ionian  dodekapolis  (Hdt. 1.142.3) and  provided  three  ships  for  the  battle  of  Lade  (Hdt. 6.8.2)  as well  as  the  general  of  the  whole  fleet,  Dionysios  (Hdt. 6.11.1). Andrapodismos  of  Phokaia  as  a  consequence  of  the  defeat  at Lade  may  be  implied  in  Hdt. 6.17  in  his  account  of  the  gen- eral  Dionysios'  decision  not  to return  home. Phokaia  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Ionian  district  and  is  recorded  from  453/2  (IG i\u00b3 260.viii.7\u00ad8,  9)  to  430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.i.49,  mostly  restored)  a total  of  twelve  times,  twice  completely  restored,  paying  a phoros  of 3  tal.  down to,  probably, 447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.ii.38), then 1  tal., 5,250  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  266.i.11)  and  from,  perhaps, 443/2 (IG i\u00b3  269.i.14)  2  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  270.i.12).  It  was  assessed  for  trib- ute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.139).In  453/2  the  tribute  is  split  up  into one  payment  of 3,000  dr.  and  one  of 2  tal., 3,000  dr. The  only  public  enactment  attested  earlier  than  C 3  is  Tod 112  (C 5l/C4e).Lines  6\u00ad18  of  this  decree  also  provide  evidence for  dikasterion,  death  penalty  and  fines.  The  eponymous official is r ecorded  as  (Tod 112.19\u00ad21),  and  other officials are r eferred  to as  generally  in  ll. 9\u00ad10.A Phokaian  grant  of  ateleia  may  be  attested  in  Iscr.  Cos  ED 71B.15\u00ad17  (C 4l).  Proxenia  was  received  from  Chios  (no. 840) (RPhil  ( 1937)  325\u00ad32  no. 6A.2  PEP  Chios 50  (C 4)).  On  the C 5s  coinage  treaty  (Tod  112)  with  Mytilene  (no. 798),  see infra. 1090 rubinstein Hdt. 1.162\u00ad64  (r 546)  recounts  how  the  Phokaians  fortified their  settlement  with  financial assistance from Arganthonios,  king  of  Tartessos,  and  describes  the  city  wall as  several  stades  long  and  constructed  from  large  blocks  of stone.  In 1990,  part  of  the  city  wall  was  found  near  the  new city  hall  of  Fo\u00e7a  (Mellink  ( 1993)  131).  For  the  results  of  exca- vations  of  the  Archaic  city  wall,  see  \u00d6zyigit  ( 1994).  They seem  to have enclosed  an  area  of  c. 50  ha.  The  archaeological evidence  in  general  appears  to  confirm H erodotos'  account, including  a  burnt  city  gate  and  C 6  debris  which  suggest  an attack  c. 540.  In  Xen.  Hell. 1.5.11  the  text  suggests  that  the Athenians  attempted  to  fortify  Phokaia  in  406,  and  the  text need  not  be  emended  (Krentz  ( 1989)  139). Old  Phokaia  is  currently  under  excavation,  and  remains of  public  architecture  have  been  discovered.  An  Archaic temple  of  Athena  is  thought  to  have  been  located  on  a  rock platform  at  the  tip  of  the  peninsula  (Mellink  ( 1955)  236, ( 1956)  382;  E.  Akurgal  ( 1956)  6\u00ad8).  It  is  assumed  that  this temple  was  destroyed  by  Harpagos  and  perhaps  repaired shortly  afterwards.  The  ceramic  record  runs  from  late Geometric  throughout  the  Classical  period.  In  Xen.  Hell. 1.3.1  it  is  reported  that  the  temple  of  Athena  burned  in  409/8. The  temple  appears  to  have  been  rebuilt  in  the  Hellenistic period.  Archaic  walls  of  a  Cybele  sanctuary  were  discovered by  \u00d6zyigit  (Gates  ( 1996)  325).  A  C 4e\u00adm  theatre  is  currently under  excavation  (Mitchell  ( 1999)  143). Phokaia  struck  coins  of  electrum,  silver  and  bronze.  ( 1) Electrum,  C 6\u00adC4:  denominations:  stater,  hekte.  Types:  obv. a  variety  of  types  with  seal  above  or  below;  rev.  quadripartite incuse  square.  ( 2)  Silver  on  the  Phoenician  standard, C 6\u00adC4:  denominations:  tetradrachm,  didrachm,  drachm and  fractions  down  to  hemiobol:  obv.  variety  of  types  with seal  above  or  below;  rev.  mostly  quadripartite  incuse  square; legend:  sometimes  .(3) Br onze:  obv.  female  head;  rev. griffin;  only  a  few  C 4  bronze  coins  carry the  legend .  In,  probably,  C 5s,  Phokaia  and  Mytilene  (no. 798)  concluded  a  treaty  that  the  two  poleis  should  take  turns and  strike  identical  electrum  coins  in  alternating  years  (IG xii.21).In  C 4  the  staters  and  hektai  struck  in  consequence  of this  treaty  became  the  principal  local  currency  of  the  poleis of  western  Asia  Minor  (Tod  112  SEG 34  849;Head,  HN \u00b2 587\u00ad89;  Jenkins  ( 1990)  18\u00ad19;  Bodenstedt  ( 1977\u00ad78a), ( 1977\u00ad78b)  with  Kraay  ( 1982);  BMC  Ionia 203\u00ad16;  SNG  Cop. Ionia 1023\u00ad33). Phokaia  was  an  active  coloniser,  founding  Lampsakos (no. 748)  in  654/3,  Massalia  (no. 3)  in  C 6f,  Alalie  (no. 1)  in C 6m,  and  Hyele  (no. 54)  c. 540  after  the  failure  at  Alalie.  It may  also  have  founded  Emporion  (no. 2)  c. 600,  possibly  in collaboration  with  Massalia,  and  Amisos  (no. 712),  possibly in  collaboration  with  Miletos  (no. 854). 860.

The  city-ethnic  is  either  (IG i\u00b3  264.iii.29, 265.i.60)  or  (IG i\u00b3  283.iii.30),  to be  distin- guished  from  the  of  Chalkidike  (no. 596)  and the (no. 789)  in  the  Hellespontine  district  (i.e. Troas). The  location  of  *Polichne  is  uncertain,  but  the  communi- ty  was  undoubtedly  situated  on  the  Mimas  peninsula. Wilamowitz-M\u00f6llendorff  's  attempt  ( 1908)  617  to  identify this  Polichne  with  that  of  Thuc. 8.14.3  was  disputed  by Kirsten  ( 1952);  Cook  ( 1953\u00ad54)  157  with  n. 3;  and  Gomme  et al.( 1981)  34\u00ad35. The  Polichnitai  were  members  of  the  Delian  League. They  belonged  to  the  Ionian  district  and  are  recorded  from 450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.ii.14)  to  428/7  (IG i\u00b3  283.iii.30)  a  total  of twelve  times,  once  completely  but  plausibly  restored.  In 448/7  (IG i\u00b3  264.iii.30),  444/3  (IG i\u00b3  268.i.27),  430/29  (IG i\u00b3 281.i.23)  and  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.144\u00ad45)  the  Polichnitai  are explictly  recorded  as  a  dependency  of  Erythrai  (no. 845).  In 450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.ii.14)  they  paid  alongside  the  other Erythraian  dependencies;  but  in  448/7  (IG i\u00b3  264.iii.30)  and in 447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.i.60)  the  other  dependencies  paid  on their  behalf.  In  later  years  their  payment  is  recorded  sepa- rately  from  that  of  the  other  Erythraian  dependencies,  and the  Polichnitai  paid  4,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  271.i.18)  but  in  428/71 tal., 3,000  dr.

The  city-ethnic  is (Hecat.  fr. 233;  IG i\u00b3  269.i.28  ( 443/2);  I.Priene 1.7  ( 334),  2.4  Tod 186.4 ( 334))  or (IG i\u00b3  260.x.8  ( 453/2)).  Priene  is  called a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.17;  Ps.-Skylax 98)  and  in  the  political  sense  (Hdt. 1.141.4,  142.3,  143.3; I.Priene 1.14\u00ad15  ( 334),  2.7  ( 334)).  The  polis  cognate  polites  is attested  in  I.Priene 10.7  (C 4),  and  politeia  in  I.Priene 2.8 ( 334)  denoting  Prienian  citizenship.  The  collective  use  of the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  decrees  (I.Priene 2.4, 7,  13\u00ad14)orinabbreviatedformonC4m  coins  (infra),  and externally  in  Hecat.  fr. 234;  Hdt. 1.15;  IG i\u00b3  260.x.8.  For  the individual  and  external  use,  see  Hipponax  fr. 123,  West ionia  1091 (C 6\u00adC5);  Hdt. 1.27.2;  and  Pl.  Prt. 343A,  all  referring  to  Bias of  Priene. In C 4  the  territory of  Priene  had  common  borders  with the  territory  of  Ephesos  (no. 844;  I.Priene 3.13  (C 4\u00adC3e)) and  with  the  territory  of  Thebes  (no. 869)  on  Mt.  Mykale (I.Priene 363.24\u00ad25  (C 4m)).  Ps.-Skylax  98  refers  to Priene  as a  polis  with  two  harbours,  one  of  which  was  kleistos. Priene  was  part  of  the  Ionian  dodekapolis  (Hdt. 1.142.3) and  was  traditionally  in  charge  of  the  Panionian  festival located  in  its  territory  on  Mt.  Mykale  (I.Priene 139.1  with Hiller  von  Gaertringen's  comment  and  Strabo 14.1.20).  The Panionia  were  moved  from  Mt.  Mykale  to  the  territory  of Ephesos  (no. 844),  perhaps  as  a  result  of  an  early(?)  war between  Samos  (no. 864)  and  Miletos  (no. 854)over Prienian  territory  (Hornblower  ( 1982b),  ( 1991)  527\u00ad29),  but were  probably  transferred  back  into  Prienian  control  in  C 4 (I.Priene 139  (C 4m)  and  PEP  Priene 11  (C 4m)).  Stylianou ( 1983)  248  suggested  that  the  move  back  to  Mt.  Mykale was  initiated  in 373.  According  to  Aeschin. 2.116,Priene filled  one  of  the  two  Ionian  seats  in  the  Amphiktyonic Council,  alternating  with  Eretria  (no. 370);  but  see  Lef\u00e8vre ( 1998)  60.", "Marathesion": "Identifier: 854. , (Marathesios) Map  56.

In  the  Archaic  and Classical  periods  this  community  is  attested  only  in  the Athenian  tribute  lists  and  in  Ps.-Skylax  98,  who  unfortu- nately  offers  no  site-classification. From I.Priene 37.57\u00ad58  (C 2)  it  appears  that  Samos  (no. 864)  claimed  to  have  received  Marathesion  from  Miletos (no. 854)  after  the  Meliac  War  (c. 700),  and  according  to Strabo  14.1.20  Ephesos  (no. 844)  later  received  Marathesion from  the  Samians  in  return  for  Anaia  (no. 838).  The  date  of this  transfer  cannot  be  determined.  Thus,  Marathesion seems  to  have  been  a  dependent  polis  first under M iletos, then  under  Samos,  and  finally under E phesos. Marathesion  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Ionian  district  and  is  recorded  from  443/2 (IG i\u00b3  269.i.5,  completely  restored)  to  415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.i.28) a  total  of  seven  times,  twice  completely  restored,  paying  a phoros  of  first  3,000  dr.

The  name  of  the  territory  was  \u00b5  in  SEG 28 697.10  Ager ( 1996)  no. 15;  this  inscription  is  an  arbitration concerning  the  territory  of  Klazomenai  and  its  neigh- bour(s)  carried  out  by  judges  from  Kos  (no. 497)  towards  the end  of  C 4.It  has  been  suggested  by  Ager  ( 1991)  that  Teos  (no. 868)  is  one  of  the  cities  which  was  involved  in  the  dispute. She  suggests  that,  in  the  inscription,  the  entire  territories  of Teos  and  Klazomenai  are  defined,  starting  from  the  border of  Kolophonia  (l. 11)  in  the  east  and  moving  westwards  on  to the  isthmus  of  the  Mimas  peninsula. It may  be  inferred  from  Ephor.  fr. 25  that  a  location  called \u00b5  was  part  of  Klazomenian  territory;  and  another settlement, ,  is  mentioned  in  Ephor.  fr. 26  Steph. Byz. 580.5\u00ad6.  Steph.  Byz.  calls  Skyphia  a   \u00b5,  but  it  is  uncertain  whether  this  site-classifi- cation  stems  from  Ephoros.  In  Thuc. 8.14.3  and 8.23.6  we  are informed  that  the  Klazomenians  fortified  on  the mainland.  We  do  not  know  if  this  Polichna  was  identical with  the  Erythraian  dependency  known  as  Polichne  (see infra  and  Gomme  et al.( 1981)  35).  At  8.23.6  Thucydides reports  that  those  Klazomenians  who  had  been  responsible for  the  rebellion  against  Athens  retired  to  after  the Athenian  conquest  of  Polichna  (see  also  Thuc. 8.31.2;  IG i\u00b3 119.5  ( 407),  and  infra).  From  Thuc. 8.31.3\u00ad4  it  appears  that the  Klazomenians  also  controlled  three  neighbouring islands:  Drymoussa,  Pele  and  Marathoussa.  These  islands were  used  for  safe  keeping  of  property. According  to  Paus. 7.3.9,  the  Klazomenians  moved  their urban  centre  from  the  mainland  to  the  adjacent  island because  of  their  vulnerability  to  attacks  in  the  Archaic  peri- od  (see  also  Strabo  14.1.36).  This  is  now  confirmed b y  the finds at the site of  Chyton  (no. 841),  identified as the A rchaic urban  centre  of  Klazomenai,  which  show  that  the  settlement was  abandoned  in  C 6m. Klazomenai  belonged  to  the  Ionian  dodekapolis  (Hdt. 1.142.3),  and  Klazomenian  representatives  acted  as  judges  in the  arbitration  between  Myous  (no. 856)  and  Miletos  (no. 854)  in  391\u00ad388  (Tod 113.21\u00ad25).  Klazomenai  was  a  member of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the  Ionian  district  and  is recorded from 454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.21)  to  416/15  (IG i\u00b3 289.i.39)  a  total  of  eighteen  times,  once  completely  restored, paying  a  phoros  of  first  1\u0153  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  261.i.11),  raised  to  5  tal., 2,000  dr.  in  427/6  or 426/5  (IG i\u00b3  284.6)  and  to  15  tal.  in  416/15 (IG i\u00b3  289.i.39).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3 71.i.147)  and  possibly  also  in  410/9  (IG i\u00b3  100.7: [ \u00b5]  []).Klazomenai defected from the League in 412  and  moved  the  urban  centre  from  the  island  to  Polichna on  the  mainland  (Thuc. 8.14.3);  but  it  was  won  back  by Athens  later  in  the  same  year.  The  bulk  of  the  population was  moved  back  to  the  island,  while  the  anti-Athenian  fac- tion  fled t o  Daphnous  (Thuc. 8.23.6).  A  Spartan  attempt  to 1076 rubinstein conquer  the  island  failed  (Thuc. 8.31.2\u00ad3),  and  the Klazomenians  were  still  allied  to  Athens  in  410  (Xen.  Hell. 1.1.10\u00ad11).  A  protracted  stasis  between  the  pro-Spartan  and probably  oligarchic  faction  in  Daphnous  and  the  pro- Athenian  and  probably  democratic  faction  in  the  urban centre  on  the  island  (Thuc. 8.31.2\u00ad3)  was  provisionally ended  in  407  by  a  treaty  between  the  Athenians  and  the  fac- tion  in  Daphnous  (IG i\u00b3  119.5  I.Erythrai 501),  but  the  stasis continued  (Diod. 13.79.1);  see  Gehrke,  Stasis 78. In 387/6  there  seems  to  have  been  a  democratic  govern- ment  in  place  in  Klazomenai,  and  a  treaty  with  Athens  was concluded  in  387/6  (Tod 114  I.Erythrai 502)  with Klazomenai  as  a  subordinate  party.  But  it  is  also  clear  that  a stasis  of  some  kind  had  preceded  this  decree.  Stasis  appears to  have  been  endemic  at  Klazomenai  in  C 4  (Arist.  Pol. 1303b9 and,  perhaps,  Aen.  Tact. 28.5\u00ad6).  In  the  King's  Peace  of 386 Klazomenai  is  explicitly  mentioned  as  an  island  belonging to  Persia  (Xen.  Hell. 5.1.31),  but,  pace  Gehrke,  Stasis 79,  there is  no  compelling  evidence  that  a  tyranny  or  a  narrow  oli- garchy  was  set  up  by  Python  when  he  conquered Klazomenai  in  C 4m  (Aen.  Tact. 28.5\u00ad6).  The  only  unques- tionably  attested  public  enactment  is  a  psephisma  of  C 4l: SEG 28  696.6,  moved by a board of  timouchoi  (l. 1)  and implying  that  the  Klazomenians  levied  taxes  on  imports  and exports  (l. 5). Hierokleides  of  Klazomenai  received  proxenia  from Athens  (no. 361)  in  424/3  (IG i\u00b3  227).  Klazomenian  theo- rodokoi  to  host  theoroi  from  Argos  (no. 347)  are  attested  in SEG 23  189.ii.1  ( 330\u00ad324).  A  cult  of  Athena  Polias  may  be attested  for  Klazomenai:  Oikonomos  ( 1921)  74  reported on an  inscription  which  he  found  in  a  sanctuary  on  the  island. He  did  not  give  a  transcript  of  the  text,  but  his  description suggests  that  the  goddess  worshipped  on  the  small  acropolis on  the  island  may  have  been  Athena  Polias. There  was  a  Klazomenian  treasury  in  Delphi  (Hdt. 1.51.2). According  to Diod. 15.18.2,  Kyme  (no. 817)  and  Klazomenai consulted  the  oracle  at  Delphi  in  383,  shortly  after  the  death of  Tachos,  in  connection  with  their  dispute  over  Leukai  (no. 819),  which  contained  an  Apollo  sanctuary.  An  Olympian victor,  Herodotos  of  Klazomenai,  is  attested  in  Paus. 6.17.2 (C 4  according  to RE  s.v.  Herodotos  1,  but  not  in Olympionikai).  For  a  Klazomenian  victor  in  the  Pythia,  see SEG 18  214  (C 4\u00adC3).SEG  18  214  is  a  communal  dedication  by the  Klazomenians  at  Delphi  (C 4\u00adC3). Like  other  Ionian  cities,  Klazomenai  may  have  been walled  in  the  Archaic  period  (Hdt. 1.162.2).On  the  mainland site  that  housed  the  urban  centre  of  Archaic  Klazomenai there  are  C 6  walls  around  the  acropolis  (Mellink  ( 1983)  440). The  island  settlement  was  unfortified in  411  (Thuc. 8.31.3). Aen.  Tact. 28.5\u00ad6  describes  a  stratagem  by which  Python  of Klazomenai  gained  control  over  the  city  by  making  wagons stop  in  the  gates,  thereby  allowing  his  forces  to  enter.  The episode  may  belong  in  C 4  after  the  King's  Peace  (Gehrke, Stasis 79;  Whitehead  ( 1990)  179).  Cook  ( 1953\u00ad54)  151 described  the  walls  of  the  island  settlement  as  of  massive square  masonry  with  backing  containing  plenty  of  black glazed  pottery  of  the  early  and  middle  C 4.  Both  the  main- land  site  and  the  island  settlement  have  been  under  excava- tion  during  the  1980s  and  1990s,  but  so  far  most  finds a wait publication. Klazomenai  minted  coins  of  electrum,  silver  and  bronze from  C 6  to  C 4.  A  silver  drachm  was  found  in  the  Asyut  coin hoard,  dating  from 499\u00ad494  (Price  and  Waggoner  ( 1975) 85).  ( 1)  Electrum  and  silver  on  the  Phoenician  standard, C 6\u00adC5:  denominations:  didrachm,  drachm,  diobol.  Types: obv.  forepart  of  winged  boar;  rev.  quadripartite  incuse square.

The  Klazomenians  were the  original  colonisers  of  Abdera (no. 640),  according  to  Hdt. 1.168;  they  were  also  co-colonis- ers  of  Naukratis  (no. 1023)  in  the  reign  of  Amasis  (Hdt. 2.178). 848.

The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  in  an  external  context  in  Ephor.  fr. 27  (verbatim  quo- tation). Myonnesos  was  located  between  Teos  (no. 868)  and Lebedos  (no. 850)  (Strabo  14.1.29),  and  was,  according  to Thuc. 3.32.1,  a  Teian  possession.  The  island  is  very  small  (c. 1 km \u00b2),but  Myonnesos  may  have  controlled  some  of  the  pera- ia.  The  island--or peninsula--settlement  of  Myonnesos was  too  small  to  support  a  town  (Bean  ( 1966)  146\u00ad49).  It must  have  been  the  equivalent  of  an  acropolis,  with  the  main settlement  on  the  mainland.  Like  Korykos  (no. 849),  it  was  a nest  of  pirates  (Ephor.  fr. 27).  The  settlement  on  the  small island  that  formed  part  of  Myonnesos,  and  which  was joined  to  the  mainland  by  a  causeway,  contains  remains  of an  early  cyclopean  wall. 856.

In  C 6  Ephesos  is  called  a  polis  as  citadel  (akropolis) in  I.Ephesos 1A.1,  and  in  the  urban  sense  in  C 6\u00adC5 (Hipponax  fr. 50.1,  West).  In  C 5  it  is  called  a  polis  in  the urban  sense  (Hdt. 1.26.2  (rC 6))  and  in  the  political  sense (Hdt. 1.141.4,  142.3\u00ad4,  143.3;  Herakleitos  fr. 121,  DK).  In  C 4  it is  called  polis  in  the  urban  sense  (Hell.  Oxy. 1.2,  Chambers; Xen.  Hell. 1.2.7\u00ad8)  and  in  the  territorial  sense  in  I.Ephesos 1420.4  (C 4),  in  which  citizenship  is  granted  on  the condition  that  the  honorands  remain .For polis  in  the  political  sense,  see  IG ii\u00b2  8523.4;  I.Ephesos 2.4 (C 4);  SEG 39  1151.2.  The  urban  centre  is  called  polisma  by Kreophylos  of  Ephesos  (FGrHist 417)fr.  1  (c. 400?).  The  polis cognate  polites  is  applied  to  the  citizens  of  Ephesos  in I.Ephesos 1419.3  and 1420.4  (both  C 4).  The  word  politeia  is used  in  the  sense  of  citizenship  in  Xen.  Hell. 1.2.10;  I.Ephesos 1421.3  (C 4).  Ephesos  was  the  patris  of  Pythokles,  who  was brought  up  and  lived  in  Athens,  and  who  was  com- memorated  by  a  funerary  epigram  (IG ii\u00b2  8523.4  (C 4e); cf.  CEG ii  485).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  externally  in  Hdt. 1.147.2;  IG ii\u00b2  1.48  Tod 97.8 ( 403/2);  IG ii\u00b2  1485.ii.9  (C 4l),  and  internally  in  I.Ephesos 2.9 and 1427.2  (both  C 4).  The  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic is  attested  externally  in  Hdt. 9.84.2;ML  95e(405);  SEG 17  111 (C 4). The  name  of  the  territory  is  '  (Hdt. 5.100,  6.16.2; I.Priene 3.13  (probably  C 3))  or  '  (Xen.  Hell. 3.2.14).  It included  the  location  Koressos  on  the  coast  (Hdt. 5.100);  cf. infra.  There  was  a  suburb  called  Smyrna  \"behind  the  polis\" (   ),  as  mentioned  by  Hipponax  fr. 50.1, West,  cf.  infra.  Priene  (no. 861)  had  a  common  border  with Ephesos,  presumably  to the  north-west  (I.Priene 3.12\u00ad14).  In Xen.  Hell. 1.5.12,  15  there  are  references  to  an  unspecified \u00b5  '  (presumably  the  city  harbour  is meant).  The  location  of  the  harbour  Panormos  mentioned in  Strabo  14.1.20  cannot  be  determined  with  certainty (Meri\u00e7  ( 1985)). Ephesian  Smyrna  has  been  located  beneath  the  agora  of the  Lysimachean  city  by  Langmann  ( 1993),  whose  identifi- cation  has  been  accepted  e.g.  by  Engelmann  ( 1990)  281\u00ad82. The  houses  excavated  on  this  site  date  from  C 8  and  C 7 (Karwiese  et al.( 1996)  12).  Langmann  ( 1993)  suggests  that the  site  was  inhabited  by  Smyrnaian  merchants. Koressos  is  mentioned  in  Hdt. 5.100  and  Xen.  Hell. 1.2.7\u00ad10;  and  it  is  referred  to  as  a \u00b5  in  Hell.  Oxy. 1.1, Chambers.  Xen.  Hell. 1.2.7  reports  that  Thrasyllos  landed his  hoplite  forces and  that  it  was located  on  the  opposite  side  of  Ephesos'  urban  centre  from the  swamp.  Robert  ( 1960)  139\u00ad44  argued,  partly  e  silentio, that  Koressos  was  an  integral  part  of  Ephesos  rather  than  a polis  in  its  own  right.  He  dismissed  the  identification  of this  Koressos  with  the  community  that  passed  the  C 3  hon- orific  decree  published  in  ibid. 132\u00ad34.  For  the  problems related  to  the  precise  location  of  Koressos,  see  Knibbe ( 1998)  76. According  to  Ephor.  fr. 126,  Ephesos  was  founded  by Proklos.  Shortly  after  its  foundation  it  became  involved  in  a war  against  Priene  in  which  most  of  the  Ephesian  citizens were  killed.  In connection  with  a  rebellion  against  the descendants  of  Androklos,  the  remaining  Ephesians  invited citizens  from  Karene  (no. 813)  and  Teos  (no. 868)  to  settle  at Ephesos,  and  the  newcomers  gave  their  names  to  two  of  the Ephesian  phylai.  C. 555\u00ad550  Ephesos  entered  into  a  treaty with  Kroisos,  presumably  as  a  subordinate  party (Polyaen. 6.50;Ael.  VH 3.26;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 107).  Ephesos  belonged  to the  Ionian  dodekapolis  (Hdt. 1.142.3)  and  its  citizens  partici- pated  as  judges  in  the  arbitration  between  Miletos  (no. 854) and  Myous  (no. 856)  in  391\u00ad388  (Tod 113.29). Ephesos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Ionian  district  and  is  recorded  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.i.22, restored)  to 415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.i.26)  a  total  of  sixteen  times,  pay- ing  a  phoros  of 7\u0153  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  260.vi.13),  from  445/4  reduced to 6  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  267.v.17),  but  in  433/2  raised  to  7\u0153  tal.  once  again (IG i\u00b3  279.i.65).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3 71.i.125).  Ephesos  revolted  against  the  Athenians  during  the Ionian  War  or,  at  any  rate,  not  earlier  than  414  (Pi\u00e9rart  ( 1995) 258),  after  which  the  Ephesians  supported  the  Peloponnesian War  effort  (SEG 39  370.23).  After  the  Peloponnesian  War Samian  exiles  were  given  asylum  at  Ephesos  (Tod  97.8 ( 403/2)).  In  395  Agesilaos  trained  his  army  in  the  urban  centre of  Ephesos  (Xen.  Hell. 3.4.16);  but  it  subsequently  joined Konon  after  the  battle  of  Knidos  in  394  (Diod. 14.84.3).  In  336 Ephesos  sided  with  Parmenion  and  Attalos,  but  changed course  again  in  334  when  citizens  with  oligarchic  leanings joined  forces  with  Memnon  (Gehrke,  Stasis 59\u00ad60). For  a  survey  of  the  history  of  the  Ephesian  constitution, see  Gehrke,  Stasis 57\u00ad60.  The  Aristotelian  collection  of  con- stitutions  included  one  of  the  Ephesians  (Heracl.  Lemb. 66; Arist.  no. 49).  Suda 3894  relates  how  Aristarchos  of  Athens was  called  to  Ephesos  to  serve  as  ruler,  and  Gehrke,  Stasis 57 suggests  tentatively  that  he  may  have  introduced  a  constitu- tion  resembling  that  of  Solon's  constitution  at  Athens.  After a  succession  of  pro-Persian  tyrants,  a  democratic  constitu- tion  was  introduced  in  492  (Herakleitos  fr. 121,DK),perhaps a  radicalisation  of  a  constitutional  arrangement  introduced by  Mardonios  in  494.  Hermodoros,  a  friend  of  Herakleitos, ionia  1071 was  exiled  after  the  introduction  of  the  constitutional change  in  492  (Gehrke,  Stasis 57\u00ad58).  Gehrke  notes  (Stasis 58)  that  there  is  no  evidence  for  any  constitutional  changes during  the  rest  of  C 5  and  most  of  C 4:  the  Ephesian  revolt against  the  Athenians  in  C 5l  (SEG 39  370.23)  does  not  neces- sarily  imply  that  the  Ephesians  had  replaced  their  democra- cy  with  an  oligarchic  constitution  (Pi\u00e9rart  ( 1995)  258  thinks it  unlikely  that  the  Ephesians  revolted  any  earlier  than 414/13).  Gehrke,  Stasis 39  suggests  that  the  regime  following the  King's  Peace  was  of  an  oligarchic  leaning,  and  that  the Ephesian  support  of  the  Makedonians  in  336  was  driven  pri- marily  by  democratic  forces  within  the  city.  An  oligarchic countermove  occurred  in  334,  when  Memnon  managed  to gain  control  of  Ephesos,  replacing  the  democratic  constitu- tion  with  an  oligarchy  that  lasted  only  until  Alexander's  vic- tory  at  Granikos  later  in  the  same  year  (Arr.  Anab. 1.17.10). The  reintroduction  of  democracy  was  accompanied  by  a massacre  of  the  oligarchs  (Arr.  Anab. 1.17.11\u00ad12). Public  enactments  passed  by  the  boule  and  the  assembly are,  e.g.,  SEG 39  1151  ( 326/5\u00ad324/3);  I.Ephesos 1419  and 1420 (both  C 4).A  sacred  law  ( \u00b5  ) is mentioned in I.Ephesos 2.5\u00ad6  (C 4).  In  I.Ephesos 1420.1\u00ad3  there  is  reference to a nomos  which  appears  to  be  the  budget  of  the  city,  desig- nating  sums  to  be  spent  on  public  works.  I.Ephesos 2  records death  sentences  passed  on  between  forty-four  and  forty-six persons  who  had  molested  a  board  of  Ephesian  theoroi  sent to  the  sanctuary  of  Artemis  at  Sardis.  The  case  was  conduct- ed  by on  behalf  of  the  goddess  Artemis  ( 2.1).It  is not  clear  from  the  text  who  had  actually  judged  the  case,  and it  has  even  been  suggested  that  it  was  heard  at  Sardis  (e.g. Masson  ( 1987)  228\u00ad29).  The  indictment  which  formed  the basis  of  the  trial  is  cited  in  the  decree. In C 4  the  eponymous  official was the  (I.Ephesos 1421.3\u00ad4,  1425.2,  1426.2  (all  C 4)).  The  boule  is  attested  in  a probouleutic  capacity  in  the  preambles  to  numerous  C 4 decrees  (e.g.  I.Ephesos 1419.2  (C 4)),and  was  in  charge  of  cer- tain  public  works  (I.Ephesos 1420.5  (C 4)).  The   (I.Ephesos 1438.3  (C 4))  were  responsible  for  assigning  new citizens  to  phyle  and  chiliastys  by  lot.  Other  officials are the board  of (I.Ephesos 1443  (C 4e)),  the   (I.Ephesos 1440.11  (C 4l))  and  the  board  of  (I.Ephesos 1440.7  (C 4l)).  For  the  neokoros  of  the  Ephesian Artemis,  see  Xen.  An. 5.3.6.  The  Ephesian  assembly  is  attest- ed  in  I.Ephesos 1389.1,  1419.2,  1420.3,  etc.  (all  C 4).  For Ephesian  commanders  and  troops  (hoplites),  see  Hell.  Oxy. 2.1,  Chambers. Ephesian  citizenship  grants  are  attested  in  Xen.  Hell. 1.2.10 (a  block  grant  of  citizenship  given  to  the  Selinuntians  (no. 44)  after  successful  defence  of  Ephesos  against  an  Athenian attack  in  409);  and  for  C 4  in  I.Ephesos 1389,  1408\u00ad45  (mostly C 4,  some  C 3),  and  SEG 39  1151.4  ( 326/5\u00ad324/3). The  civic  subdivisions  of  Ephesos  are  known  primarily from  citizenship  decrees,  in  which  it  is  stipulated  that  the  hon- orand  be  assigned  to  a  phyle  and  a  chiliastys:  I.Ephesos 1421.6 (C 4):   ,   '\u00b5. According  to  Ephor.  fr. 126,  there  were  five phylai  at  Ephesos: Bennaioi,  Teioi,  Karenaioi,  Euonymoi  and  Ephesioi.  Bennaioi is  undoubtedly  a  false  rendering  of  Bembineis.  The  phyle \u00b5  is  attested  in  I.Ephesos 1419.4, \u00b5  in I.Ephesos 1427.4, '  in  I.Ephesos 1420.5, in I.Ephesos 1421.6,  and in  I.Ephesos 1415.17  (all  C 4, 1415  as  late  as  c. 300  (Rhodes,  DGS 358)).  The  epigraphical record  provides  the  names  and  phyle  affiliation of  some  fifty chiliastyes;  see  Jones,  POAG 312. Ephesian  embassies  are  attested  epigraphically  in I.Ephesos 1436.1  (C 4)  and  I.Ephesos 1437.2  (before  321).  In  C 4 the  city  granted  proxenia  to  a  citizen  of  Kyrene  (no. 1028) (I.Ephesos 1389  (C 4))  and  to a  Makedonian  (I.Ephesos 1433.2\u00ad3).  Between  325  and 275,  Monounios,  son  of Sophokles  of  Ephesos,  was  appointed  proxenos  by  Delphi (no. 177).  For  a  grant  of  enktesis,see I.Ephesos 1389  (C 4l). Ephesian  theoroi  are  attested  in  I.Ephesos 2.3\u00ad4,  10  SEG 36 1011  (c. 350\u00ad300);  for  theorodokoi  to  host  theoroi  from  Argos (no. 347),  see  SEG 23  189.ii.8  ( 330\u00ad324). Although  Hdt. 1.26.2  may  suggest  that  the  urban  centre  of Ephesos  was  moved  at  some  point  during  C 6  or  C 5,  this  is not  at  all  certain  (see  \u00d6zyigit  ( 1988)  94\u00ad96).  Herodotos  need not  imply  any  more  than  that  the  urban  centre  had  expand- ed  considerably  since  C 6  and  that  the  Artemision  thus  was no  longer  situated  7  stades  outside  the  city  walls. So  far,  very  little  of  the  monumental  architecture  of Archaic  and  Classical  Ephesos  has  been  excavated.  In  addi- tion  to  a  temple  of  Meter  Theon  and  a  structure  which  was probably  an  Apollo  sanctuary,  the  Artemision,  perhaps  the most  important  monument  in  the  whole  of  Ephesos,  has been  uncovered  and  described  (Bammer  and  Muss  ( 1996)). According  to  Hdt. 1.26.2  (rC 6),  the  Artemis  temple  was  sit- uated 7  stades  from  the  walls  of  the  old  urban  centre.  The foundation  of  the  earliest  temple  has  been  dated  to  C 8.On the  fire  of  the  Archaic  Artemision  in  C 4m,  see  Knibbe ( 1998)  89.  He  rejects  the  tradition  of  the  mad  pyromaniac Herostratos  and  offers  a  more  plausible  explanation:  viz. that  the  foundations  of  the  temple  had  been  causing  prob- lems  since  the  days  of  Kroisos  and  were  slowly  sinking.  In addition  the  ground  level  was  constantly  rising  because  of alluvial  deposits  from  the  river  Kaystros.  The  fire  con- 1072 rubinstein veniently  made  it  possible  to  construct  the  late  Classical Artemision  on  higher  ground  than  its  predecessor.  For  an account  of  C 7\u00adC6  finds  in  the  Artemision,  see  Wiplinger and  Wlach  ( 1995)  107\u00ad8.   \u00b5  is mentioned  in  I.Ephesos 1438.4  (C 4),  from  which  it  appears that  citizenship  grants  were  displayed  in  the  temple.  Other temples  or  cult  sites  are  attested  epigraphically:  I.Ephesos 101  (C 5)  mentions  a  hieron  of  Zeus  Patroios  and  a  hieron of  Apollo  Patroios,  as  does  I.Ephesos 102  (c. 300).  The  hieron of  Zeus  Patroios  is  also  attested  in  I.Ephesos 104 (C 5).  I.Ephesos 107  is  a  C 4  private  dedication  to  '. The  preserved  theatre  (TGR  iii. 494\u00ad96)  dates  from  the Hellenistic  period, but  an  inscription  of C 4l (I.Ephesos 1440.10)  stipulates  that  the  honours  bestowed  on Sostratos  are  to  be  proclaimed  in  the  theatre  at  the  festival  of Dionysos.  According  to  Xen.  Hell. 3.4.18  and  Ages. 1.25, Ephesos  had  several  gymnasia  in  C 4.  That  Ephesos  was  for- tified in C 6f  is  apparent  from  Herodotos'  account  of  a  siege by  Kroisos  ( 1.26.2;  cf. 1.141.4).  So  far,  a  C 6f  city  wall  has  not been  confirmed archaeologically,  but  a  stretch  of  polygonal wall  on  the  north  slope  of  the  Panayirdag hill is dated by ceramic  evidence  to  c. 500  and  is  probably  part  of  a  city  wall (Scherrer  ( 2001)  60  figs. 3  no. 4  and 3  no. 9). Of  Ephesian  festivals,  the  Thesmophoria  are  mentioned in  Hdt. 6.16.2,  and  the  Dionysia  in  I.Ephesos 1440.10  (C 4l). For  the  Artemisia  and  the  Ephesia  and  the  question  as  to whether  these  two  names  refer  to  one  festival  or  two,  see Hornblower ( 1991)  527\u00ad29  with  references  to the  general  dis- cussion.  A  communal  dedication  by  the  Ephesians  to Athena  is  recorded  in  IG ii\u00b2  1486.5\u00ad6  (C 4l). For  the  Ephesian  calendar,  see  Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 96\u00ad99  \u00a7 84. At  least  six  months  were  identical  with  the  Athenian months. Ephesian  citizens  are  attested  as  victors  in  the  Olympic Games  (Olympionikai 398  ( 380),  431  ( 356)  and  438  ( 352)),  in the  Isthmian  Games  (I.Ephesos 1416.20  (C 4l))  and  in  the Nemean  Games  (I.Ephesos 1415.6,  1416.20\u00ad21  (c. 300)). Ephesos  struck  coins  from  C 7l.  (I)  Electrum  C 7l\u00adC6: denominations:  stater  and  fractions  down to forty-eighth.

The  collective use  of the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  abbreviated  form  on C 4  coins  (infra)  and  in  SEG 45  1619.3  (C 4l/C3e)),  and  exter- nally  in  literary  sources  (Hdt. 6.8.1)  and  in  inscriptions  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.153;Tod 113.33  ( 391\u00ad388)).  The  individual  and  external use  is  attested  on  a  late  Classical  funerary  monument  set  up at  Athens  (IG ii\u00b2  9973). Not  much  is  known  about  the  extent  of  Myesian  territory in  the  Classical  period.  The  only  piece  of  evidence  is  Tod  113 ( 391\u00ad388),  recording  an  arbitration  concerning  land  in  the Maiandros  valley  to  which  Miletos  (no. 854)  and  Myous  had both  laid  claim.  The  Myesians  lost  the  case  by  default. In 494  Myous  provided  three  ships  for  the  battle  of  Lade (Hdt. 6.8.1),  and  it  seems  to  have  been  under  Persian  control even  after  the  establishment  of  the  Delian  League:  the Persian  king  granted  tax-levying  rights  at  Myous  to Themistokles  during  the  latter's  exile  (Thuc. 1.138.5). 1088 rubinstein Myous  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Ionian  district  and  is  recorded  from  452/1  (IG i\u00b3 261.ii.30)  to  430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.i.15,  mostly  restored)  a  total  of eleven  times,  twice  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1 tal.  (IG i\u00b3  272.ii.12,  restored  in  all  other  lists)  but  1\u0153  tal.  in 452/1  (IG i\u00b3  261.ii.30,  conj.)  and  in  432/1  (IG i\u00b3  280.i.62).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.138). A  C 4l/C3e  grant  of  proxenia  and  of  citizenship  is  attested in  SEG 45  1619,  the  sole  surviving  public  enactment ( \u00b5,ll.16\u00ad17) passed by the bouleanddemosof  Myous (ll. 10\u00ad11).  This  decree  also  contains  a  grant  of  ateleia  (ll. 5\u00ad6). Because  of  the  absorption  of  Myous  into  Miletos  (no. 854)  in  the  Hellenistic  period,  very  little  remains  on  the  site, the  ruins  of  which  may  have  been  used  as  a  quarry  after  the polis  had  ceased  to  exist  (Bean  ( 1966)  246).  The  site  was  sur- veyed  by  H.  Weber  in  1964  and 1966.Weber ( 1965)  reports  on two  temples,  an  \"upper\"  and  a  \"lower\",  of  which  he  assumed that  the  upper  temple  was  the  older  one,  dating  from  C 6m. A  sanctuary  of  Apollo  is  attested  in  SEG 45  1619.18.

Polis  in  the  territorial  sense  is  attested in  Kritias  fr. 2.7,  DK,  and  Tod  192.16  ( 332/1).  Polites  is  applied to  the  citizens  in  Isoc. 8.98.  Politeia  is  used  in  the  sense  of  cit- izenship  in  PEP  Chios 12.27  (c. 320),  and  in  the  sense  of  con- stitution  in  Ath.  Pol. 24.2  (rC 5).  The  word politeuma  in  the sense  of  constitution  is  used  in  Tod  192.3  ( 332/1),  in  which Alexander  the  Great  prescribes  that  the  Chian  constitution is  to  be  democratic.  The  asty  of  Chios  is  referred  to in  I.D\u00e9los 9.3  SEG 19  510,33.633  (C 6)  and  PEP  Chios 78.2  (C 4);  and  in Hdt. 6.15.1  the  citizens  are  called  astoi.In IG ii\u00b2  10510.7  (cf. CEG ii  606  (C 4))  Chios  is  the  patris  of  Symmachos,  son  of Simon.  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  inter- nally  in  PEP  Chios 12.23  (c. 320)  and  externally  in  literature (Thuc. 7.57.4;  Arist.  Pol. 1303a34)  and  in  inscriptions  (Tod 118.16\u00ad17  ( 384);  IG ii\u00b2  43A.24  ( 378/7)).  The  individual  use  is found  externally  in  IG ii\u00b3  683  (C 6);  Hipponax  fr. 30.2,  West (C 6\u00adC5);  Simon.  fr. 19.1,  West;  SEG 36  50.2  ( 490\u00ad480);  and IG iv\u00b2.1123.117  (C 4).  There  is  also  one  internal  attestation  of the  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  (PEP  Chios 266.2 (C 3l/C2e)). The  territory of  Chios  is  referred  to as     in Hdt. 6.26.1.  The  names  of  several  locations,  some  of  which may  have  been  second-order  settlements  in  C 5,  are  known from  epigraphical  and  literary  sources:  Koila,  which  accord- ing  to  Hdt. 6.26.1  contained  a  Chian  garrison  in  494; Kardamyle  (Thuc. 8.24.3);  Boliskos  (Thuc. 8.24.3;Ephor.  fr. 103);  Phanai  (Thuc. 8.24.3);  and  Leukonion  (Thuc. 8.24.3). Delphinion,  a  site  with  more  than  one  harbour  on  the  coast 1064 rubinstein just  north  of  the  urban  centre of  Chios,  was  fortified b y the Athenians  in  412/11  (Thuc. 8.38.2),  and  traces  of  the  C 5  forti- fication on the t op  of  a  small  acropolis  were  reported  by Boardman  ( 1956)  41\u00ad49.  The  site  is  also  mentioned  in  PEP Chios 75  BCH 3  ( 1879)  242\u00ad55  a 8  (C 5\u00adC4).  PEP  Chios 76  BCH 3  ( 1879)  230\u00ad41  ( 475\u00ad450)  mentions `\u00b5  (c. 2,  4), (?) (c.6),  (c. 9), [ ]  (d. 17\u00ad18), \u00b5  (sic!)  (d. 20),     (d. 22\u00ad23)  and  (a. 11\u00ad12).  Section  c  of  the  inscription  is concerned  with  the  definition and preservation of  official boundaries  of  the  area  .  It  is  clear  from  c. 9\u00ad15  that the  polis  took  an  active  interest  in  the  preservation  of  these boundaries,  but  the  nature  of as  a  locality  is  not quite  clear.  PEP  Chios 75  BCH 3  ( 1879)  242\u00ad55  of  C 5\u00adC4 provides  some  more  names: (a. 22,  32,  a  sanctuary  is located  here),  and  (a. 34,  36\u00ad37:  an  area  that  con- tained  a  swamp  and  a  lake).  For  a  more  comprehensive overview  of  second-order  settlements  on  the  island,  see  fur- ther  the  gazetteer  in  Yalouris  ( 1986)  143\u00ad59.  The  community at  modern  Emporio  (which  cannot  be  securely  associated with  any  ancient  toponym;  see  Boardman  ( 1967)  254\u00ad56) was  a  sizeable  one.  The  Archaic  settlement  contained  a walled  acropolis  dating  from  C 7  (ibid. 4\u00ad5),  a  harbour,  at least  two  sanctuaries,  and  a  residential  area  on  the  hill  of Prophitis  Elias  of  considerable  density,  estimated  by Boardman  to  number  more  than  fifty  houses  in  an  area  of less  than  0.04  km \u00b2.  The  houses  appear  to  have  been  aban- doned  in  C 7,  but  there  is  evidence  of  Classical  and Hellenistic  occupation  on  the  hill  to  the  west  of  the  Archaic settlement  (ibid. 35). In  addition  to  their  territory  on  Chios  itself,  the  Chians also  controlled  the  islands  of  Oinoussai  (Hecat.  fr. 142;  Hdt. 1.165.1;  Thuc. 8.24.2).After  Harpagos'  attack  on  Phokaia  (no. 859)  c. 546,the  Phokaians  approached  the  Chians  with  a  view to  purchasing  and  resettling  in  these  islands;  but  according to  Hdt. 1.165.1,  the  Chians  refused  to  sell  because  they  feared the  establishment  of  a  rival  emporion  that  might  cut  off  their own  island  from  trade.  In  412,the  Athenians  used  the  islands as  a  naval  base  for  raids  against  Chios  after  the  latter's  seces- sion  from  the  Delian  League.  In  Hdt. 6.26.2  a is  mentioned,  but  it  is  not  clear  from  the  context  if  this  site was  located  on  Chios  itself  or  if  it  was  identical  with Polichne  on  the  Mimas  peninsula,  a  settlement  that  had become  an  Erythraian  dependency  by  C 5m.  In  C 6  Chios gained  control  of  Atarneus  (no. 803)  in  Aiolis  in  exchange for  handing  over  the  refugee  Paktyes  to  the  Persian  king (Hdt. 1.160.3\u00ad5).  Chios  still  possessed  Atarneus  as  part  of  its peraia  as  late  as  398/7  (Xen.  Hell. 3.2.11);  however,  at  that  time the  site  was  used  as  a  base  by  Chian  exiles.  It  is  probable, though  far  from  certain,  that  Chios  lost  its  Asian  peraia  as  a result  of  the  King's  Peace  (Debord  ( 1999)  264\u00ad72).  Chios appears  to  have  lost  control  completely  by  the  360s  at  the  lat- est,  when  Atarneus  had  been  taken  over  by  Euboulos  (Arist. Pol. 1267a31\u00ad37),  who  was  succeeded  by  Hermias  as  ruler  of the  place  (note,  however,  Theopomp.  fr. 291,  which  may indicate  that  Hermias  was  originally  installed  by  the  Chians and  the  Mytilenaians  (no. 798)  as  episkopos  of  the  Chian  and Lesbian  peraiai,  probably  including  Atarneus  and  its  sur- roundings). All  calculations  of  the  size  of  the  Chian  citizen  population are  based  on  the  size  of  the  Chian  fleet ( infra)  combined with  very  varying  assumptions  about  the  number  of  Chian citizens  on  board  each  ship  (Roebuck  ( 1986)  81;  Walter ( 1993)  97  n. 37).  See  Thuc. 8.15.2  for  evidence  that  the  Chian slaves  formed  part  of  the  crews  in  412  (cf.  Hunt  ( 1998)  46, 86).  Chios  is  referred  to by Thuc. 8.15.1  as  being  the  largest  of all  the  poleis  that  remained  in  the  Athenian  alliance  in  412, and  in  Thuc. 8.45.4  Alkibiades  claims  that  the  Chians  were the  wealthiest  of  all  the  Greeks. Chios  appears  to  have  been  a  strong  naval  power  from very early  on.  Its  contribution  of 100  ships  to  the  combined Ionian  fleet in  494  was  larger  than  that  of  any  other  polis involved,  and  there  were  forty  picked  citizen  troops  on board  each  ship  (Hdt. 6.15.1).  In  440/39  Chios  and  Lesbos together  provided  twenty-five  ships  for  the  Athenian  war against  Samos  (no. 864)  (Thuc. 1.116.2),  while  in  430  there were  fifty  Chian  and  Lesbian  ships  involved  in  the  raids  on the  Peloponnese  (Thuc. 2.56.2).  Chian  ships  participated  in the  Pylos  campaign  in  425  (Thuc. 4.13.2),  in  the  attack  on Melos  (no. 505)  in  416/15  (Thuc. 5.84.1),  and  in  the  Sicilian expedition  in  415\u00ad413  (Thuc. 6.43,7.20.2).It  may  be  inferred, e.g.  from  Thuc. 8.15.2,  that  normally  the  Chians  would themselves  supply  the  crews  for  the  ships  participating  in Athenian  campaigns:  after  Chios'  open  revolt  in  412,  the seven  ships  previously  provided  to  Athens  as  a  token  of  good faith  (Thuc. 8.9.2)  were  no  longer  held  to  be  trustworthy, and  the  free  men  on  board  (presumably  Chians)  were imprisoned,  while  the  slave  members  of  the  crews  were  set free.  When  the  Chians  made  their  approach  to  the  Spartans in 412,  they  claimed  to  have  at  least  sixty  ships  to  contribute to  their  new  alliance.  The  calculation  of  ship  numbers  in Gomme  et al.( 1981)  27\u00ad32  suggests  that  the  Chians  may  not have  exaggerated. In C 5l/C4e  the  organisation  of  the  Chian  armed  forces comprised  units  called  dekades:  two  inscriptions  (PEP  Chios 61  and 62)  record  slaves  enrolled  in  these  units,  and,  in  PEP ionia  1065 Chios 62,  slaves  who  had  been  granted  their  freedom  by  the polis.  Three  Chian  military  commanders  who  had  assisted the  Spartans  at  Aigos  Potamoi  were  honoured  with  statues at  Delphi  (Paus. 10.9). Chios  was  part  of  the  Ionian  dodekapolis  (Hdt. 1.142.2), and  Chian  citizens  participated  in  the  Ionian  arbitration between  Myous  (no. 856)  and  Miletos  (no. 854)  arranged  by Strouses  (Tod  113.17  ( 391\u00ad388)).In  Thuc. 8.40.1  the  Chians  are made  to  characterise  themselves  as  the  \"largest  of  the  allied poleis  in  Ionia\".  Yet,  perhaps  because  the  Chians  themselves regarded  their  city  as  a  Euboian  foundation  quite  separate from  the  other  Ionian  foundations  on  the  Asiatic  mainland, Chios'  regional  affiliation does not seem t o  have  been  self- explanatory  in  Antiquity.  In  his  work     Ion of Chios  (FGrHist 392)  fr. 1  relates  how  the  Chian  basileus Hektor,  the  great-grandson  of  Amphiklos  of  Histiaia,  took the  initiative  to  persuade  the  Chians  to  participate  in  the Panionia.  Paus. 7.4.8,  having  cited  the  passage,  adds  that  Ion failed  to  explain  why  Chios  was  counted  among  the  Ionian poleis  (cf.  Thuc. 8.6.2:   '  ). Ion  of  Chios  (FGrHist 392)fr.  1  is  our  earliest  source  for the  Chian  version  of  its  foundation  by  Oinopion,  Melas and  others,  with  a  second  wave  of  settlers  under  the  leader- ship  of  Amphiklos  of  Histiaia  in  Euboia.  That  the  founda- tion  myth  had  an  early  origin  is  indicated  by  the designation  of  Chios  as []  in I.D\u00e9los 9.3  ( 550\u00ad500). In  the  Archaic  period,  Chios  and  Miletos  supported  each other  as  allies  in  at  least  two  wars:  Miletos  backed  Chios  in  its war  against  Erythrai  (no. 845)  (terminus  ante  quem:  c. 600), while  the  Chians  returned  the  favour  by  aiding  the  Milesians against  Alyattes  of  Lydia  (Hdt. 1.18.3  (c. 600)).  Chios  appears to  have  escaped  conquest  by  the  Lydians  and  later  the Persians  right  up  until  the  aftermath  of  the  Ionian  Revolt  in 493,  when  the  Persians  attacked  the  island.  An  andrapodis- mos  may  be  indicated  in  the  account  of  how  the  Chians  were \"netted\"  by  the  Persians  (Hdt. 6.31.1\u00ad2).  According  to Herodotos,  the  Chians  had  previously  established  a  treaty  of xenie  with  Kroisos  (Hdt. 1.27.5),  perhaps  implying  that Chios  was  not  a  dependent  polis  as  such,  although  it  proba- bly  operated  under  considerable  political  constraint  from Lydia.  After  the  Persian  conquest  of  Lydia,  the  islands  off  the Ionian  coast  \"gave  themselves  up\"  to  Kyros  without  a  fight (Hdt. 1.169.2),and  Chios  probably  continued  as  a  dependent polis  within  the  Persian  Empire  from  this  point.  It  is  not known,  however,  if  Chios  was  subject  to  the  same  Persian demands  for  tribute  and  troops  as  the  Ionian  poleis  on  the mainland  (see  e.g.  Roebuck  ( 1986)  86).  From  at  least  as  early as 513  to 480/79,  Chios  was  ruled  by  the  pro-Persian  tyrant Strattis  (Hdt. 4.138.2,  8.132.2). Chios  was  one  of  the  first poleis  to  join  the  Delian  League after  the  battle  of  Mykale  (Hdt. 9.106.4).  As a  contributor  of ships  rather  than  money,  Chios  remained  autonomos  (Thuc. 3.10.5,  6.85.2,  7.57.4),  de  jure  at  any  rate,  although  Arist. Pol. 1284a39\u00ad41  suggests  that  the  de  facto  relationship  was heavily  dominated  by  Athens,  to  the  extent  that  the  terms  of their  alliance  were  actually  broken  by  the  Athenians.  A  bilat- eral  treaty  concerning  access  to  judicial  procedures  in Athens  between  Chios  and  Athens,  presumably  with  Chios as  a  subordinate  party,  may  have  been  in  force  in  C 5m  (IG i\u00b2 10.10\u00ad11,  but  the  restoration  is  very uncertain).  Chios  went over  to  the  Peloponnesian  side  in  412,  and  the  Spartans established  a  military  presence  on  the  island  as  early  as 412/11,  led  by  the  Spartan  nauarch  Pedaritos  (Thuc. 8.17.1, 38.3\u00ad4).  Thuc. 8.38.3\u00ad4,  along  with  the  very  fragmentary Hell.  Oxy. 5,  Chambers,  suggests  that  Pedaritos  was  heavy- handed  in  his  interference  in  internal  Chian  affairs.  That  the Spartan  involvement  in  Chios  continued  to  compromise Chian  autonomy  is  indicated  by  the  report  in  Diod. 13.65.3\u00ad4 that  the  Spartan  commander  Kratesippidas  restored  Chian oligarchic  exiles  to  the  island  and  occupied  the  acropolis  in 409/8.  Sparta's  direct  involvement  in  Chios  continued  for nearly  a  decade  after  the  end  of  the  Peloponnesian  War,  until the  Chians  expelled  the  Spartan  garrison  after  the  Athenian victory  in  the  battle  of  Knidos  in  394  (Diod. 14.84.3). Chios  entered  into  alliance  with  Athens  in  384/3  (Tod 118). The  treaty  appears  to  have  been  on  equal  terms,  and  Chian eleutheria  and  autonomia  are  guaranteed  (ll. 19\u00ad24). Although  Diod. 15.26.3  may  suggest  that  the  Spartans  man- aged  to  re-establish  temporary  control  over  the  island  after that  point,  this  cannot  be  substantiated  by  any  other  evid- ence.  In  any  case,  Chios  was  a  founding  member  of  the Second  Athenian  Naval  League  from  378/7  (IG ii\u00b2  43.24  and 79  Tod 123).  In  363  Epameinondas  succeeded  in  winning over  the  Chians;  but,  according  to  Diod. 15.79.1,  his  death shortly  afterwards  prevented  the  Thebans  (no. 221)  from consolidating  their  influence.  Chios  seceded  from  Athens again  in  357  (Dem. 15.3;Diod.  16.7.3),  when  it  formed  an anti-Athenian  alliance  with  Kos  (no. 497),  Byzantion  (no. 674)  and  Rhodos  (no. 1000),  with  further  backing  from Maussolos.  From  at  least  as  early  as  346  Chios  fell  within  the Hekatomnid  sphere  of  power.  It  is  likely  that  a  permanent Karian  garrison  was  established  by  Idrieus,  if  not  even  earli- er  by  Maussolos  (Dem. 5.25;  for  a  recent  discussion  of  the numismatic  evidence,  on  the  basis  of  which  it  has  been argued  that  the  Karian  presence  was  established  already  in 1066 rubinstein the  reign  of  Maussolos,  see  Debord  ( 1999)  382\u00ad83).  A Makedonian  garrison,  maintained  from  Chian  funds,  was imposed  by  Alexander  the  Great  (PEP  Chios 32  SEG 35  925 ( 334\u00ad330)),  along  with  a  demand  for  twenty  manned triremes  paid  for  by the  Chians. As  noted  above,  there  were  numerous  second-order  set- tlements  on  Chios,  and  some  of  them  were of  considerable size.  It  has  been  argued  that  the  formation  of  a  centralised Chian  polis  with  Chios  town  as  its  urban  centre  happened relatively  late.  ML  8  PEP  Chios 23  ( 600\u00ad550)  forms  an important  part  of  the  argument.  On  the  assumption  that  the text  is  indeed  Chian,  one  interpretation  of  the  boule  demosie in  ll.  C. 5\u00ad6,  manned  by  fifty  representatives  from  each  phyle (the  number  of  which  is  unknown),  is  that  the  council served  the  purpose  of  uniting  the  different  local  communi- ties  in  a  single  administrative  and  political  structure  (see recently  Walter  ( 1993)  94  and  Nomima i264\u00ad66  with  refer- ences  to  previous  discussions).  It  cannot  be  ruled  out  that the  peaceful  abandonment  of  the  settlement  at  Emporio c. 600  (Boardman  ( 1967)  37\u00ad38)  was  directly  related  to  a process  of  centralisation,  of  which  ML  8  may  then  represent a  later  stage.  We  may  thus  be  dealing  with  an  early  form  of synoecism.  However,  Yalouris'  gazetteer  ( 1986)  contains  at least  eight  second-order  settlements  with  continued  occu- pation  during  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  ( iii.8\u00ad9,  20, iv.5\u00ad6,  v.1,  4,  vi.4),  so  it  is  likely  that  a  considerable  part  of the  Chian  population  continued  to  reside  outside  the  urban centre.  Continuous  occupation  of  the  Chian  urban  centre up  to  modern  times  has  prevented  systematic  excavation, which  means  that  the  process  and  level  of  Archaic/Classical urbanisation  cannot  be  assessed  on  the  basis  of  archaeolog- ical  evidence. The  modern  reconstruction  of  early  Chian  political  insti- tutions  is  based  on  the  inscription  PEP  Chios 23  ML 8 ( 600\u00ad550);  but  doubts  concerning  the  origins  of  the  inscrip- tion  have  been  raised,  and  it  cannot  be  ruled  out  that  the inscription  pertains  to  Erythrai  (no. 845)  (for  a  parallel example,  see  I.Erythrai 15  PEP  Chios 25  (C 4m)).  The  text itself  points  to  a  constitution  in  which  the  assembly  had  a function  as  a  legislative  body  (A. 1\u00ad2),  and  it  may  also  have had  some  judicial  capacity  (A. 7).  The  council  (boule demosie,C. 5\u00ad6)  appears  to  have  had  a  probouleutic  function in  addition  to  a  judicial  one  (C. 9\u00ad14).  There  were ways  of calling  senior  officials ( demarchoi  and  basileis)  to account (A. 3\u00ad6),  although  the  procedural  details  are  not  clear. The  constitutional  arrangements  of  Archaic  Chios  were probably  disrupted  by  the  ascent  of  the  tyrant  Strattis (before  513  to 480/79).  In  C 5  until 412,  Chios  appears  to  have had  a  moderate  constitution  which  is  not  easily  labelled  as either  a  democracy  or  an  oligarchy  (O'Neill  ( 1978\u00ad79)). There  is  no  direct  evidence  for  a  Chian  assembly  in  C 5, although  Thuc. 8.9.3  may  indicate  that  it  did  exist.  PEP  Chios 76  ( 475\u00ad450)  attests  a  board  of  officials called \" the  Fifteen\" who  report  to  the  boule  (B. 1\u00ad5).The  Fifteen  have  the  author- ity  to  impose  fines on other officials  (here  the  horophylakes, B. 15\u00ad19).  There  is  mention  of  a  dicastic  panel  consisting  of 300  unbribed  men  (B. 21\u00ad25).The  official designated basileus has  as  part  of  his  task  the  pronouncing  of  public  curses (D. 7\u00ad9).  It  is  not  known  if  eligibility  to  serve  as  bouleutes,as an  official,  or  as  a  judge  was  restricted  by  a  property  census or  by  other  criteria  in  this  period.  Thucydides'  account  of the  Chian  revolt  from  Athens  in  412  suggests  that  the  boule had  considerable  scope  for  independent  action:  negotia- tions  with  the  Peloponnesians  had  evidently  been  conduct- ed  without  the  consent  of  the  broader  population  ( 8.9.3), and  the  citizens  who  were  involved  in  planning  the  revolt were  in  a  position  to  arrange  that  a  meeting  of  the  Chian boule  would  be  in  progress  when  the  Spartans  made  their surprise  arrival  on  the  island  ( 8.14.1\u00ad2). The  moderate  Chian  constitution  was  then  replaced  by  a much  narrower  oligarchic  one  (Thuc. 8.38.4).Opposition  to the  new  regime  was  crushed  (Thuc. 8.24.6,  38.3),  and  this constitution  probably  continued  until  394,  except  perhaps for  a  brief  period  between  410  and 409/8  (Pi\u00e9rart  ( 1995) 268\u00ad69).  PEP  Chios 2  (C 5l/C4e)  is  a  public  enactment  with the  heading  boules  gnome  (l. 2),  while  SEG 35  923.B.13\u00ad26 (C 5\u00adC4)  is  a  law  passed  by  the  boule  presided  over  by the basileis.  There  is  no  mention  of  an  assembly  in  either inscription. There  are  no  Chian  public  enactments  that  can  be  secure- ly  dated  to  the  period  between  394  and 355,  and  we  know very  little  about  its  political  institutions  (Tod  118.33\u00ad34  ( 384) probably  referred  to Chios'  boule  in  addition  to unspecified archai).  There  is  no  decisive evidence  to prove  that  the Chians  reintroduced  democracy  in  connection  with  their alliance  with  Athens  (pace  Gehrke,  Stasis 46).  By  355  the Chian  constitution  was  definitely oligarchic (Dem. 15.19), but  it  is  not  clear  whether  this  was  the  result  of  a  recent  sta- sis.  The  abolition  of  an  extreme  oligarchic  government  in Chios,  mentioned  in  Arist.  Pol. 1306b3\u00ad5,  may refer  to the period  around  394  or  to  constitutional  upheavals  in  C 4m,  as argued  by  Gehrke,  Stasis 46.  However,  constitutional  conti- nuity  may  be  suggested  by  the  fact  that  the  eponymous  offi- cial  is  the  prytanis  throughout  the  Classical  period  (PEP Chios 2.1  (C 5\u00adC4),  75.A.20  (C 4m),  80.23\u00ad24  (C 4s),  32.1 ( 334\u00ad330));  whereas  the  single  prytanis  had  been  replaced  by ionia  1067 a  board  of  prytaneis  by c. 320,  perhaps  on  an  Athenian  model (PEP  Chios 12.A.30).  The  restoration  of  the  heading [  ]  \u00b5  in  SEG 35  923.A.1  (c. 400)  is  disputed (Rhodes,  DGS 230). When  Alexander  the  Great  decreed  in  334\u00ad330  that  the Chian  constitution  was  to  be  democratic,  a  fundamental revision  of  Chian  legislation  (nomoi,  PEP  Chios 32.5)  was deemed  necessary  (PEP  Chios 32.4\u00ad6).  The  institutions attested  in  PEP  Chios 12  (c. 320)  were  undoubtedly  the  result of  these  reforms.  The  psephisma  (A. 43)  was  passed  by  a  pop- ular  assembly  (A. 1:   \u00b5),  and  the  magistrates mentioned  in  the  decree,  with  the  exception  of  the  agono- thetes  (A. 29),  were  serving  as  members  of  boards  (prytaneis, A. 30;  tamiai,A. 33;  exetastai,A. 37). The  best  evidence  for  the  judicial  system  in  C 5  is  provid- ed  by PEP  Chios 76  ( 475\u00ad450).  Impending  court  cases  (per- haps  concerning  disputed  property)  were to be  announced by kerykes  in  the  countryside  as  well  as  the  urban  centre (B. 5\u00ad20),  and  the  penalties  of  fines and atimia  are  also attested  here  (C. 14\u00ad15).  The  polis  appears  to  have  assumed responsibility  for  conducting  cases  on  behalf  of  individuals who  have  been  evicted  from  their  property  (D. 1\u00ad5).  Dikai prodikoi  are  granted  to two  teams  of  foreign  judges  in  PEP Chios 12  A. 16\u00ad17  (c. 320). Taxes  payable  to  the  polis  and  to  a  local  settlement  ( ) are  attested  in  PEP  Chios 75  B. 45\u00ad46  (C 4m).  Total  ateleia  is granted  to  a  priestess  in  PEP  Chios 6.11\u00ad12  (C 4),  while  limit- ed  ateleia  from  import  and  export  taxes  is  granted  in  PEP Chios 12  A. 17\u00ad18  (c. 320).Free  foreigners  are  subject  to  special charges  in  connection  with  the  sacrifices r egulated  in  PEP Chios 78.12\u00ad13  (C 4).  For  a  list  of  free  foreigners  attested  epi- graphically,  see  Sarikakis  ( 1986)  130\u00ad31. Chian  envoys  were sent  to Lakedaimon  (no. 345)  in  413/12 (Thuc. 8.4\u00ad6.1),  to  Astyochos  in  412/11  (Thuc. 8.40.1)  and  to Athens  (no. 361)  in  384/3  (Tod 118.13).Chian  citizens  received proxenia  from  Athens  (IG ii\u00b2  23  ( 388/7))  and  Anaphe  (no. 474)  (Michel  662.17\u00ad18  (C 4)).  Chios  bestowed  proxenia  and citizenship  on  a  group  of  foreign  judges  from  Naxos  (no. 507)  and  Andros  (no. 475)  (PEP  Chios 12.17\u00ad19,  27).  PEP Chios 50  is  conventionally  interpreted  as  a  C 4m  list  of  Chios' proxenoi  in  different  communities  (at  least  fifteen);  cf.  PEP Chios 12  SEG 12  390.31\u00ad32:    . Chian  theorodokoi  hosted  theoroi  from  Argos  (no. 347) c. 330\u00ad324  (SEG 23  189.ii.4)  and  theoroi  announcing  the Nemean  Games  (SEG 36  331.ii.46\u00ad49  ( 323/2)).  The  Chians were  given  promanteia  in  Delphi  (F.Delphes iii.3213 (C 4\u00adC3));  and  in  C 5e  they  sent  a  chorus  of 100  young  men (Hdt. 6.27.2).  For  the  altar  of  Apollo  dedicated  by  the Chians,  see  Hdt. 2.135.4  and  F.Delphes iii.3212  (after  480). Xenopeithes  of  Chios  was  victorious  at  Olympia  in  480 (Moretti  ( 1970)  296). The  system  of  civic  subdivisions  underwent  more  than one  radical  reform  during  the  Classical  period.  There  was  a phyle  structure  attested  perhaps  as  early  as  C 6f  (assuming that  PEP  Chios 23.C.8\u00ad9  ML 8  relates  to Chios);  but  there is  as  yet  no  attestation  of  the  traditional  six  Ionian  phylai (Pi\u00e9rart  ( 1985)  182).  Jones,  POAG 191\u00ad93  argues  for  a  three- tier  structure  in  C 5\u00adC4e,  tentatively  identifying  the  groups as  phylai,  phratries  (PEP  Chios 80.28  (C 4m))  and  gene  (PEP Chios 7.2  (C 4m)).It  was  assumed  by  Forrest  ( 1960),followed by  Jones,  POAG 194  and  Pi\u00e9rart  ( 1985)  181\u00ad82,  that  the  three- tier  structure  was  replaced  by  a  more  complex  system  with four  tiers  in  C 4s.  In  this  system  the  phylai  consisted  of  num- bered  subdivisions  ( ,  ,  ).  These  sub- divisions  were  in  turn  further  subdivided  into  units designated  by  numbers  ( ,  ,  ,  etc.),  each  of  which  were subdivided  into  groups  designated  by  a  \"patronymic\".  While the  groups  designated  by  numbers  and  \"patronymic\"  are well  attested  in  C 4l  (PEP  Chios 71,  72,  73  (c. 315))  and  occupy an  uncontroversial  place  in  the  hierarchy  of  subdivisions,  it is  more  problematic  to  identify  the  named  subdivisions  in C 5  and  C 4f  as  either  phylai,  phratries  or  gene.  Some  groups, such  as  the  Kaukaseis  (PEP  Chios 8  ( 450\u00ad425))  and  the Klytidai  (PEP  Chios 75  (C 4m)),  had  complex  administrative and  political  structures;  but  it  is  still  uncertain  if  these groups  belonged  in  the  uppermost  tier  as  phylai  or  at  a  lower level  as  phratries.  The  mention  of  Zeus  Patroios  in  a  decree passed  by  the  Klytidai  (PEP  Chios 80.35  (C 4s))  has  led  some to  suggest  that  the  group  was  indeed  a  phratry  (for  a  sum- mary  of  the  debate,  see  Graf  ( 1985)  36\u00ad37);  but  nothing  can be  concluded  with  certainty.  It  may  be  suggested  on  the  basis of  PEP  Chios 75.11\u00ad12  and 29  that  the  Klytidai  had  originally been  a  territorially  based  unit,  perhaps  centred  on  a  second- order  settlement  ( 45\u00ad46: ),  not  unlike  the  Kleisthenic demes.  The  same  may  be  true  of  the  Kaukaseis  (Hdt. 5.33.1 mentions ,a  location  on  the  coast).  For  this  inter- pretation,  see  Graf  ( 1985)  35  pace  Forrest  ( 1960)  188,who believed  that  the  Kaukaseis  derived  their  name  from Kaukasos,  the  companion  of  Chios'  mythical  founder Oinopion.  PEP  Chios 9  (C 4\u00adC3)  allows  the  interpretation that  admission  of  the  next  generation  of  Chians  to the  cit- izen  body  was  controlled  locally  in  the  civic  subdivisions. The  text  is  a  list  of  members  of  the  Totteidai  (perhaps  a phratry)  who  have  been  admitted  to  the  agogaia. Chios  was  exposed  to  numerous  outbreaks  of  stasis  and, consequently,  exiles  are  frequently  mentioned  in  the 1068 rubinstein sources.  Arist.  Pol. 1303a34\u00ad35  refers  to Chian  exiles  in Antissa  (no. 794)  in  Lesbos,  who  were later  expelled  by the Antissaians  because  of  the  threat  that  they  posed. Unfortunately  the  event  cannot  be  dated.  Hdt. 8.132.2  relates how  six  conspirators  against  the  tyrant  Strattis  fled the island  in  480/79  after  their  assassination  plans  had  been revealed.  The  defection  of  Chios  from  Athens  in  412  was  the result  of  rivalry  between     and    (Thuc. 8.9.3,  14.2),  and  we  hear  of  Chian  exiles  once  again  after  the Chians  had  sided  with  the  Peloponnesians.  A  party  of  pro- Spartan  oligarchic  exiles  was  restored  to  the  island  by  the Spartan  commander  Kratesippidas  in  409/8  (Diod. 13.65.3\u00ad4).  If  Pi\u00e9rart's  ( 1995)  interpretation  and  dating  of SEG 39  370  are  correct,  the  exiles  mentioned  in  the  inscrip- tion  as  \"friends  of  Sparta\"  are  identical  with  the  exiles  in Diod. 13.65.3\u00ad4.  According  to Pi\u00e9rart,  the  members  of  the extreme  oligarchic  regime  set  up  by  Pedaritos  were  expelled by  the  Chians,  who  were  taking  advantage  of  the  reversal  of Spartan  fortunes  after  the  Athenian  victory  at  Kyzikos  in 410.When  Kratesippidas  had  succeeded  in  bringing  the  pro- Spartan  exiles  back  to  the  island,  they  in  turn  exiled  600  of their  opponents,  and  the  latter  set  up  base  at  Atarneus. According  to  Xen.  Hell. 3.2.11,  the  second  group  of  exiles  still occupied  the  Chian  peraia  in 398.The  letter  of  Alexander  the Great  to  the  Chians  (PEP  Chios 32  SEG 35  925  ( 334\u00ad330)) stipulated  that  Chian  exiles  were  to  be  allowed  to  return  (l. 2):  these  exiles  were  undoubtedly  of  democratic  or  anti- Persian  orientation  (or  both),  and  may  have  been  forced  out in  the  wake  of  constitutional  upheavals  in  C 4m  (see  Dem. 15.19).  In  the  same  letter  Alexander  instructed  the  Chians  to impose  exile  on  Medising  citizens  (ll. 11\u00ad12). Although  excavations  of  individual  plots  in  Chios  town have  uncovered  parts  of  the  ancient  agora,  we  depend almost  exclusively  on  literary  evidence  for  the  identifica- tion  of  major  civic  structures  in  the  urban  centre.  Ps.- Skylax 99  mentions  the  harbour.  Aen.  Tact. 11.3\u00ad5  provides evidence  for  dockyards,  a  stoa  and  a  tower  near  the  har- bour,  but  the  date  of  the  event  related  in  this  passage  is uncertain.  A  sanctuary  of  Athena  Poliouchos  is  attested  in Hdt. 1.160.3  (rC 6).  Aen.  Tact. 17.5  refers  to  the  Chian  agora (C 4).  A  festival  of  Dionysos  is  attested  in  Aen.  Tact. 17.5  and PEP  Chios 12  A 22  (c. 320),  which  involved  a  procession  to  his altar,  perhaps  located  in  the  agora.  For  a  comprehensive discussion  of  cults  and  cult  sites  on  the  island,  see  Graf ( 1985)  22\u00ad146. The  Chian  calendar  included  some  Attic  months,  e.g. Posideon  (PEP  Chios 80.23  (C 4)),  but  also  the  month Leukatheon  (PEP  Chios 75  A 25  (C 5\u00adC4)),  which  is  peculiar to  the  Ionian  cities  in  Asia  Minor  (Graf  ( 1985)  18\u00ad21; Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 102\u00ad5). In 425/4  the  Athenians  ordered  the  Chians  to tear  down their  new  wall  in  order  to  deter  them  from  revolting  (Thuc. 4.51);  it  is  not  clear  whether  this  wall  was  just  an  addition  to existing  fortifications or whether Chios had been unforti- fied before this time.  In  412/11  the  Athenians  besieged  its urban  centre  in  vain,  and  it  is  highly  likely  that  it  was  protected  by  walls  (Thuc. 8.38.3,  40.1,  56.1,  61.3).  Aen.  Tact. 11.6  provides  further  evidence  for  city  walls,  but  the  date cannot  be  ascertained. Chios  struck  coins  on  the  Chian  standard  ( 15.6  g)  from c. 550.  The  earliest  attested  issue  is  an  electrum  hekte.  Types: obv.  sphinx;  rev.  four-part  incuse  square  (anepigraphic). There  was  simultaneous  minting  of  silver  and  electrum staters  525\u00ad510.  Hardwick  ( 1993)  213  suggests  that  the  silver staters  were  issued  c. 525\u00ad493,  and  that  the  series  may  have been  discontinued  after  the  Persian  attack  on  the  island  in 493.  A  second  series  of  silver  staters  was  issued  c. 490\u00ad435: obv.  sphinx  and  amphora;  rev.  four-part  incuse  square (anepigraphic).  From  435\u00ad425:  obv.  sphinx,  amphora  and grapes;  rev.  four-part  incuse  square  (anepigraphic). Hardwick ( 1993)  216  argues  for  a  break  in  the  minting  of  sil- ver  staters  425\u00ad412.  A  unique  electrum  stater  is  dated  by Hardwick  to  the  period  immediately  after  the  revolt  of 412: obv.  sphinx,  amphora  and  wreath;  rev.  four-part  incuse square  (anepigraphic).  There  is  a  corresponding  silver tetradrachm  to  which  Hardwick  assigns  the  same  date. From  the  last  decade  of  C 5  to c. 330  silver  tetradrachms  and fractions  were  issued  continuously:  obv.  sphinx  and  ampho- ra;  rev.  four-part  incuse  square;  legend:  sometimes  magis- trate's  name  or  anepigraphic.  Chios  also  struck  bronze  coins in  C 4:  obv.  sphinx  and  grapes;  rev.  amphora;  legend:  and  magistrate's  name  (Hardwick  ( 1993);  SNG  Cop.  Ionia 1539\u00ad55). The  Chians  are  named  as  the  founders  of  Maroneia  (no. 646)  in  Thrace  by Ps.-Skymnos  676.  They  also  participated in  the  foundation  of  the  Hellenion  at  Naukratis  (no. 1023) (Hdt. 2.178.2). 841.Chyton  Map 56.  Lat. 38.20,long.  26.45.  Unlocated. Size  of  territory:  unknown but  probably  1  or 2.  Type:  C.  The toponym is ,  (I.Erythrai 502.9\u00ad10  Tod 114 ( 387/6);  Ephor.  fr. 78).  Chyton  is  probably  identical  with  the Chytron  mentioned  by Arist.  Pol. 1303b9,  and is  an almost  universally  accepted  conjecture  for  MSS .The reason  for  recording  Chyton  in  this  Inventory  is  Aristotle's information  that  Chyton  and  Klazomenai  (no. 847)  tended ionia  1069 to  break  up  into  two  political  communities  like  Kolophon (no. 848)  and  Notion  (no. 858),  which  in  some  periods  were split  up  into  two  poleis. According  to  Strabo  14.1.36,  Chyton  was  located  on  the site  of  Old  Klazomenai,  which  was  later  moved  to  an  island connected  with  the  mainland  by  a  causeway.  It  is  perfectly conceivable  that  habitation  may  have  continued  on  the  site of  Klazomenai's  former  urban  centre.  Recent  excavations conducted  by  G.  Bakir  and  his  team  show  that  the  C 6 mainland  site  was  indeed  abandoned  after  494,  but  that habitation  resumed  around  400  (Mellink  ( 1984)).  The results  of  later  excavations  placed  the  date  of  abandonment of  the  Archaic  settlement  further  back,  in  the  550s  and  540s (Mellink  ( 1992)  142).  Excavation  of  C 4  houses  on  the  main- land  site  revealed  two  phases:  the  first from c. 400  to 380\u00ad370, when  these  houses  were  ruined;  the  second  phase  from c. 370\u00ad330  (Mellink  ( 1987)  23).  The  chronology  of  the  main- land  settlement  corresponds  quite  well  to  the  little  that  can be  gleaned  from  literary  and  epigraphical  sources  for  the history  of  Chyton  in  C 4;  and  Strabo's  identification of  this settlement  with  Old  Klazomenai  thus  seems  to  be  con- firmed. Chyton  presents  problems  akin  to those  relating  to Anaia (no. 838).Although  part  of  Klazomenian  territory,  it  consti- tuted  a  considerable  \"nuisance  factor\"  like  other  peraiai (Hornblower  ( 1991)  405)  in  that  it  provided  a  haven  for  cit- izens  dissatisfied w ith  the  constitutional  set-up  of  their  city (Gehrke,  Stasis 78\u00ad79).  The  decree  I.Erythrai 502  Tod 114, passed  by  Athens  in  387,  promised  Athenian  non-interven- tion  in  a  conflict between the Klazomenians and      (l. 9).  The  Klazomenians  were  given  full  authority  in matters  regarding  a  peace  settlement  with  the  people  at Chyton  (ll. 8\u00ad9),  some  of  whom  were  held  as  hostages  by  the Klazomenians  (ll. 9\u00ad10).  It  is  perhaps  significant that no city-ethnic  derived  from  the  name  of  the  locality  Chyton  is used  in  this  document:  the  conflict is v iewed  as  an  internal conflict w ithin  the  community  of  Klazomenai  rather  than  a war  between  two  poleis.  We  do  not  know  how  the  people  of Chyton  would  have preferred  to represent  themselves;  but  it should  be  noted  that  Arist.  Pol. 1303b9  uses  the  same  expres- sion  as  the  decree  (       ). 842.  Dios  Hieron  (Diosirites) Map  61.  Lat. 38.00,long. 27.05.  Size  of  territory:  probably  1  or 2.  Type:  B.  The toponym is  `,  (Thuc. 8.19.2;  IG i\u00b3  65.12 ( 427/6)).  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  37.27  (C 5))  or (IG i\u00b3  289.i.42).  Dios  Hieron  is  not  attested  as  a polis  in  any  Archaic  or  Classical  source,  but  the  collective  use of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  an  external  context  in  IG i\u00b3 37.27  (C 5)  and  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (infra). Dios  Hieron  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Ionian  district  and  is  recorded  from  454/3 (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.23)  to  416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.42)  a  total  of  fourteen times,  paying  a  phoros  first of 1,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.23)  from 442/1  of 500  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  270.i.4).  It  is  often  listed  together  with Kolophon  (no. 848)  (five times) and/or N otion  (no. 858)  (six times)  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.21\u00ad23,  289.i.40\u00ad42;  Pi\u00e9rart  ( 1984)  171  n. 49).  An  Athenian  decree  of 427/6  honouring  a  citizen  of Kolophon  indicates  that  at  this  point  Dios  Hieron  (called  a chorion)  was  dependent  on  Kolophon  (IG i\u00b3  65.11\u00ad14). However,  as  dated  and  restored,  another  decree  of  C 5  men- tions  the  citizens  of  Dios  Hieron  on  a  par  with  the  citizens  of Kolophon  and  Lebedos  (no. 850),  and  all  three  cities  are  to cover  the  travelling  costs  and  daily  expenses  of  five elected oikistai  to  be  sent  out  from  Athens  (IG i\u00b3  37.27).  So  far,  we have no  evidence  for  Dios  Hieron  in  C 4;  but  its  reappear- ance  as  a  community  in  its  own  right  in  the  Hellenistic  period  (SEG 39  1244.i.22;Head,  HN \u00b2650)  may  serve  as  an  indication  in  favour  of  its  continued  existence  as  a  polis  in C 4. 843.

The  topo- nym  is  not  attested  in  the  Classical  period;  but  it  was  proba- bly ',  derived  from  the  city-ethnic  ', attested  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists.  Engelmann  and Merkelbach  ( 1972)  37,  followed  by  Barr.,  reject  the  identific- ation  with  the  island  '  mentioned  by  Strabo 13.1.67  and  note  that  many  Greek  communities  derived  their name  from  their  olive  trees. The  Elaiousioi  were  members  of  the  Delian  League.  They belonged  to  the  Ionian  district  and  are  recorded  from  448/7 (IG i\u00b3  264.iii.30)  to  427/6  or 426/5  (IG i\u00b3  284.2\u00ad3)  a  total  of eleven  times,  five times c ompletely  but  plausibly  restored. Elaious  is  explicitly  recorded  as  a  dependency  of  Erythrai ( ' ') in two lists (IG  i\u00b3  281.i.22,  284.2) and  in  the  assessment  of 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.151\u00ad52).  In  448/7 and 447/6  they  paid  alongside  the  other  dependencies  of Erythrai  (no. 845);  they  all  formed  a  syntely,  but  the Elaiousioi  paid  on  their  own  behalf  (IG i\u00b3  264.iii.30, 265.i.63).  In  later  years  their  payment  is  recorded  separately from  that  of  the  other  Erythraian  dependencies.  They  paid 100  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  268.i.28)  and  were  assessed  at  a  phoros  of 100  dr. in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.151\u00ad52). 844. ", "Boutheia": "Identifier: 840. , (Boutheieus) Map  56.

Boutheia  is called  a  by Theopomp.  fr. 369,  but  this  designation does  not  rule  out  that  Boutheia  was  indeed  a  polis,  as  its membership  of  the  Delian  League  suggests  that  it  was.  The collective  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  the Athenian  tribute  lists  (infra). Boutheia  cannot  be  located  with  precision,  and  several sites  in  the  Erythraia  have  been  suggested  as  likely  candi- dates.  Now  that  the  existence  of  an  Archaic  temple  of Athena  (part  of  which  can  be  dated  back  to  C 8)  has  been confirmed  at  Ildir,  the  site  of  Classical  Erythrai,  the hypothesis  that  the  site  at  Ilica  contained  Archaic  Erythrai must  be  abandoned  (Mitchell  ( 1985)  83).  Ilica,  then,  must be  another  potential  location  of  Archaic  and  Classical Boutheia;  but  it  may  equally  well  have  housed  one  of  the four  other  sites  known  to  have  formed  part  of  the Erythraian  syntely  (cf.  Erythrai  (no. 845)).  Only  numismat- ic  and/or  epigraphical  evidence  found  in  situ  can  provide  a conclusive  answer. Boutheia  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Ionian  district  and  is  recorded  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3 259.v.19)  to  427/6  or 426/5  (IG i\u00b3  284.1)  a  total  of  fourteen times,  five times c ompletely  but  plausibly  restored.  In  430/29 Boutheia  is  explicitly  recorded  as  a  dependency  of  Erythrai (IG i\u00b3  281.i.20:[ ]~ ').  In  453/2  the Boutheieis  paid  3  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  260.x.5).  In  450/49,  448/7  and 447/6  they  paid  alongside  the  other  dependencies  of Erythrai;  they  all  formed  a  syntely,  but  the  Boutheieis  paid on  their  own  behalf  (IG i\u00b3  259.v.19,  260.x.5,  263.ii.17, 264.iii.30,  265.i.62).  In  later  years  their  payment  is  recorded separately  from  that  of  the  other  Erythraian  dependencies, and  they  seem  in  all  years  to  have  paid  1,000  dr.

For  its  urban  centre,  see  infra. Some  lexicographers  seem  to  agree  in  calling  Stryme  an emporion  (Harp. 49,  perhaps  derived  from  Philoch.  fr. 43 or  from  Dem. 50.20;  cf.  Suda  1231). Stryme  was  situated  in  the  Briantike,  a  region  formerly called  Galla\u00efke  and  belonging  to  the  Thracian  Kikones  (Hdt. 7.108\u00ad9).  Stryme  was  an  island  off  the  Thracian  coast colonised  by  Thasos  (Harp. 49,  quoting  Heraclid.  Pont.  fr. 125,  Wehrli)  and  the  C 3  historian  Philostephanos  of  Kyrene (FHG iii  28\u00ad34,  omitting  this  fragment)).  Demosthenes stresses  its  lack  of  a  safe  harbour  at  least  for  naval  units (Dem. 50.22: \u00b5 ).  Describing  the  march  of Xerxes'  army  through  the  Aegean  Thrace,  Herodotos 880 loukopoulou ( 7.108\u00ad9)  presents  a  confusing  account  of  Stryme's  location: west  of  Mesambrie,  the  westernmost  settlement  in  the  peraia  of  Samothrake,  and  separated  from  it  by  the  river Lissos,  but  also  east  of  Lake  Ismaris,  which  lay  between Maroneia  and  Stryme.  These  incoherent  pieces  of  informa- tion  do  not  allow  any  secure  identification.  It  is  usually assumed  that  Stryme  was  a  Thasian  coastal  outpost  border- ing  on  the  territory  of  Maroneia  (Lazaridis  1971a),  and therefore,  ever  since  its  foundation  in,  probably,  C 7,a constant  bone  of  contention  between  these  two  cities. Vaguely  attested  is  a  first c ontention  in  C 7s  (Philoch.  fr. 43, citing  Archilochos,  fr. 291,  West);  a  direct  conflict in  361/60 was  solved  by Athenian  intervention  in  support  of  the Thasians  (Dem. 12.17,  50.20\u00ad22)  recording  the  Athenian arbitration  (cf.  Isaac  ( 1986)  70\u00ad71).  Stryme  was  presumably destroyed  c. 350  by  the  Maronitans,  possibly  supported  by Philip  II  (Bakalakis  ( 1967)  145). Stryme  is  inconclusively  identified w ith  the  ancient  forti- fied settlement e xcavated  on  a  peninsula  north-east  of  Cape Molyvoti  (plan  in  Lazaridis  ( 1972)  fig. 71)  with  remains  dating  from  C 6l  to  C 4f  (Bakalakis  ( 1967);  disputed  by  Isaac  ( 1986)  12,  71\u00ad72).  The  present  configuration of  the peninsula  allows  the  hypothesis  that,  as  recorded  by Philostephanos  (supra),  it  was  indeed  an  island  during  at least  part  of  Antiquity  (Kranioti  ( 1990)  629;  for  a  tentative demarcation  of  the  extent  of  Stryme's  territory,  see  Lazaridis ( 1972b)  4.19).  Archaeological  remains  include  parts  of C 5\u00adC4m  fortification walls and cross-walls built in irregular masonry  with  brick  superstructure,  subterranean  tunnels, cisterns  and  wells  in  the  southern  edge  of  Cape  Molyvoti, which  were  interpreted  as  having  constituted  a  major  aque- duct,  on  the  analogy  of  the  Eupalinean  aqueduct  in  Samos but  on  a  much smaller  scale.  Furthermore,  there  are  traces  of a  small  port  located  south  of  the  city,  and  a  group  of  five grave  monuments  with  three  inhumations  and  two  crema- tions  dated  to  450\u00ad425  bordering  a  roughly  paved  road,  to the  north-east  of  the  cross-wall.  Imported  pottery  in  the entire  excavated  area  consists  exclusively  of  Attic  C 5\u00adC4 ware.  The  urban  centre  extended  south  and  east  of  the citadel,  while  the  cemetery  spread  over  the  west  flank of  the cape,  outside  the  wall.  On  the  evidence  of  a  few  excavated C 5l\u00adC4m  private  houses,  it  is  believed  to  have  conformed  to the  Hippodameian  urban  system  (Bakalakis  ( 1967)); Kranioti  ( 1984)).  A  cemetery  with  tumuli  containing  C 5  cist graves  and  sarcophagi  was  excavated  4  km  north  of  the walled  settlement  (Bakalakis  ( 1967)  3\u00ad18;  on  the  recent  dis- covery c. 4  km  north  to north-east  of  Molyvoti  of  four  C 5s sepulchral  tumuli,  see  Triantaphyllos  ( 1992)  655\u00ad59). 651.Zone  (Zonaios) Map  51.Lat.40.50,long.25.45.Size  of territory:  probably  2.

Zone  is  listed  among  members  of  the  Delian  League  in  the assessment  decree  of 422/1,  and  was  assessed  at  2  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 77.5.27\u00ad28),  an  indication  that  it  was  the  richest  if  not  the largest  of  the  cities  of  the  peraia  of  Samothrake. Zone  was  situated  on  the  beach  front,  between  Sale  and Serreion  (Hdt. 7.59.2),  in  the  vicinity  of  Drys  (Ps.-Skylax 67),  also  located  near  Serreion.  It  has  been  sought  at  Cape Makri  (identified w ith  Serreion),  right  below  the  Zonaia Mts.  (presumably  Choban  Dag),  and  was  tentatively  identi- fied w ith  a  site  near  the  modern  village  of  Makri  (ATL  i. 518; Bakalakis  ( 1961)  15;  Lazaridis  ( 1971c)  39;  for  an  early  discus- sion  of  proposed  unjustified identifications  simplifying  the admittedly  confused  settlement  pattern  transmitted  by  lit- erary  sources  for  this  area,  see  Robert  ( 1940)  and,  more recently,  Isaac  ( 1986)  128\u00ad33).  However,  numerous,  other- wise  rare  coins  of  Zone  have  turned  up  during  the  systemat- ic  excavation  of  the  urban  centre  near  the  mouth  of  the stream  Shabla  Dere,  formerly  identified w ith  Mesambria. These  finds strongly support the now prevailing v iew  that the  site  is  ancient  Zone  (BE  ( 1976)  464,(1978)  312,(1979)  282, ( 1980)  319,(1981)  326;  TIR 61;  Thrace  ( 1994)  80; J.  Tsatsopoulou  ( 1995)  671\u00ad73;  Galani-Krikou  ( 1996),  contra Soustal  ( 1991)  354\u00ad55;  according  to  Triantaphyllos  (Thrace ( 1994)  80)  Mesambria  may  have  been  some  older  name  of Zone).  This  identification was r einforced  by  the  discovery  of an  Archaic  sanctuary  of  Apollo  (see  infra),  the  poliad  deity of  Zone,  as  evidenced  by  this  city's  C 4  coinage. The  excavated  urban  centre  near  Shabla  Dere,  dating from  C 6  to  the  Hellenistic  period,  is  organised  in  accord- ance  with  the  Hippodamic  system,  with  cross-intersecting paved  roads,  various  types  of  house  and  an  elaborate sewage  system.  It  is  protected  by  two  contiguous  fortifica- tion  walls  (ashlar  and  pseudo-isodomic  poros  masonry,  the western  wall  in  Lesbian  masonry)  measuring 1370  and 960 m  respectively  and  enclosing  an  area  of 50  ha),  reinforced with  rectangular  towers  extending  from  the  seaboard  to  the top  of  a 108.5  m-high  acropolis;  the  southern  sea-wall  is thrace  from  nestos  to  hebros  881 presumed  to  have  disappeared  in  the  sea  (J.  Tsatsopoulou ( 1987)  472),  as  did  the  presumed  port  installations (Vavritsas  ( 1988)  80).  The  south-west  part  of  the  enclosed area,  measuring 50.50 46.50  m,  was  densely  built  and additionally  fortified  with  an  internal  wall.  Ceramic  pipes probably  belonging  to  the  city  aqueduct  were  discovered near  a  mountain  spring  c. 1,500  m  to  the  north-west (Vavritsas  ( 1973)  122).  Extensive  C 5\u00adC3  cemeteries  were identified  west  of  the  urban  centre  (P.  Tsatsopoulou ( 1997)).  A  decree  discovered  in  the  excavations  remains unpublished  (BE  ( 1976)  464). The  evidence  of  the  coins  indicates  that  the  poliad  deity  of Zone  was  Apollo  (Galani-Krikou  ( 1996),  ( 1997)).  His  sanc- tuary,  with  a  C 6  temple,  probably  in  antis  or  prostyle,  has been  identified on the hill-top near the eastern fortification wall.  Inside  the  temenos  were  found  parts  of  the  cult  statue  of c. 600,  as  well  as  rich  votive  offerings,  including  numerous sherds  with  graffitti ( J.  Tsatsopoulou  ( 1988)  491\u00ad92;(1989); Thrace  ( 1994)  83).  Epigraphically  attested  is  the  cult  of Demeter  in  a  small  C 4  sanctuary  by  the  south-eastern  end  of  the  western  fortification wall,  with  numerous  offerings  of silver  and  gilded  votive  plaques  representing  Demeter,  Kore and  Cybele  (Vavritsas  ( 1973)  77\u00ad81,(1984)  27\u00ad29).Moreover, the  rich  oak  forest  covering  the  Zonaia  Mts.  in  the  vicinity  of Cape  Serreion  and  lying  in  the  territory  of  Zone,  has  been associated  with  the  activity  of  Orpheus  (Apoll.  Rhod.  Argon. 23\u00ad31;  Nic.  Ther. 458\u00ad464;  cf.  Pompon.  Mela  2.28;  cf.  Robert ( 1940)  82\u00ad90).

The  toponym is ,  (Hdt. 7.109.1;  Archestratos  fr. 56,  Olson  and Sens;  IG iv\u00b21  94.ib.29,  Epidauros  ( 359);  SEG 43  486.21, Bulgaria  (C 4m)).The  toponym  evidently  recalls  Maron,  son of  Euanthes,  Apollo's  priest  at  Homeric  Ismaros  (Hom.  Od. 9.197;C5f  coins  (infra));  the  probable  linguistic  connection between  Maroneia  and  Ismaros  is  underlined  by  Isaac ( 1986)  113  n. 224.  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3 260.vi.19;Xen.  An. 7.3.16;  SEG 43  486.27\u00ad8,  Bulgaria)  or (IG i\u00b3  263.iii.22)  or  (IG i\u00b3 269.iii.6).  Maroneia  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by Hekataios  (fr. 159),  Herodotos  ( 7.109.1)  and  Ps.-Skylax  ( 67). The  political  sense  is  attested  in  IG ii\u00b2  43.78  and 87  where Maroneia,  under  the  heading  ,  is  listed  as  one  of  the members  of  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League.  The  collec- tive  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on  coins (infra)  and  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3 260.vi.19)  and  in  literary  sources  (Dem. 50.20\u00ad23).  For  the individual  and  external  use,  see  the  funerary  inscriptions  IG ii\u00b2  9286\u00ad93  from  Athens  and  Xen.  An. 7.3.16. The  city's  territory  extended  according  to  Lazaridis (( 1972)  4  and  plan  21)  from  the  slopes  of  Mt.  Ismaros  in  the east  to  the  course  of  the  river  Philiouri  (probably  identified with  the  ancient  Lissos)  and  the  banks  of  Lake  Ismaris  in  the west  and  to  the  river  Kourou  and  the  northern  slopes  of  Mt. Ismaros  to  the  north,  but  Pantos  claims  that  it  must  at  times have been  far  more  extended,  including  Stryme  to the  west (Pantos  ( 1983)  168  para. 14).  The  C 5s  population  of Maroneia,  a  vast  and  prosperous  city,  is  estimated  at  c. 12,000 (Lazaridis  ( 1972)  14.44\u00ad45,  with  refs.),  or  at  15,000\u00ad20,000 (Samsaris  ( 1980)  167\u00ad68). Maroneia  was  situated  on  a  coastal  plateau  east  of  Stryme and  Lake  Ismaris lake  of  Mitrikon  (Hdt. 7.109.1;Strabo 7 878 loukopoulou fr. 44)  and  west  of  Orthagoria  (Strabo  7  fr. 48;  Plin.  HN 4.42: between  Dikaia  and  Cape  Serreion),  on  the  fertile  vine- growing  slopes  of  Mt.  Ismaros  (Suda 645,  222;  Eust.  Od. 1.133.9;  cf.  Hom.  Od. 9.196\u00ad211;  Archiloch.  fr. 2;  Plin.  HN 14.53\u00ad54). The  exclusive  testimony  of  Ps.-Skymnos  ( 675\u00ad78)  refer- ring  to  Maroneia  as  a  colony  of  Chios  is  usually  accepted (Isaac  ( 1986)  114).  Its  foundation  is  dated  before  C 7m,  when Maronitans  clashed  with  Thasians  over  the  possession  of Stryme  (Archiloch.  fr. 2,  quoted  by  Philoch.  fr. 43).  The  city fell  undoubtedly  under  Persian  rule  following  the  occupa- tion  of  Thrace  by  Megabazos.  With  the  Persian  rule  termi- nated  under  unspecified circumstances (Isaac ( 1986)  115\u00ad16 with  bibliography)  Maroneia  predictably  entered  the  Delian League.  It  belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded in  the  tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.5)  to  415/14  (IG i\u00b3 290.iii.19)  a  total  of  twenty  times.  It  paid  a  phoros  of 1  tal. 3,000  dr.  down  to  443/2  (IG i\u00b3  269.iii.6)  or  perhaps  441/0  (IG i\u00b3  271.ii.44).  From  436/5  it  paid  10  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  276.v.29), reduced to 3,000  dr.  in  430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.ii.8).  In  425/4  it  was presumably  assessed  at  the  enormous  sum  of 21  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 71.iii.156,  city-ethnic  restored).  Moreover,  numismatic  evi- dence  suggests  close  financial and political r elations  with the  Odrysian  kingdom.  On  the  justifiably disputed t ribute imposed  on  Abdera  and  other  Greek  cities  of  the  northern Aegean  by  the  Odrysians,  see  Veligianni  ( 1995a)  with  refs. and  Loukopoulou  ( 2003). In C 4,  Maroneia  became  a  member  of  the  Second Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.87).Moreover,its  relations with  the  Odrysians  were  further  strengthened  in  C 4f,  as  was the  antagonism  with  other  powerful  Greek  cities  of  the north  Aegean  who  had  financial interests in the Thracian hinterland.  C. 400  a  Maronitan  served  as  a  councillor  at  the court  of  Seuthes  II  (Xen.  An. 7.3.16).  In  376/5  Maroneia  is believed  to  have  supported,  if  not  invited,  the  Triballian invasion  which  resulted  in  the  catastrophic  defeat  of  Abdera (Diod. 15.36.3\u00ad4;  cf.  schol.  Ael.  Arist. 172.7,  173.17).  She  had apparently  also  succeeded  in  driving  Thasos  away  from Stryme,  and  the  dispute  was  solved  only  with  Athenian intervention  (Dem. 12.17,  17.23,  50.20\u00ad23,  51.17).  A  recently published  inscription  from  Vetren  in  Bulgaria  discloses  the privileged  position  of  Maroneia  in  the  Thracian  commerce under  Kotys  I  and  his  successors  (SEG 43  486;  Velkov  and Domaradzka  ( 1994);  cf.  Loukopoulou  ( 1999),  ( 2002), 2003));  it  was  brought  to  an  end  by  Philip  II's  conquest  of southern  Thrace  and  the  dissolution  once  and  for  all  of the  Odrysian  power  (Dem. 23.183;Polyaen.  Strat. 4.  2.  22). Maroneia's triremes  and  army,  which  included  mercenaries and  \"neighbouring  barbarians\"  are  mentioned  in  relation  to her  dispute  with  Thasos  over  Stryme  in  361  (Dem. 50.14\u00ad15, 20\u00ad23). We  have  no  information  about  the  constitution  of Maroneia.  Maronitan  ambassadors  are  recorded  in  361/0 (Dem. 50.20\u00ad23).  In  359  Maroneia  had  a  theorodokos  to  host theoroi  from  Epidauros  (IG iv\u00b21  94.ib.  29).  In  C 4  Karthaia bestowed  proxenia  on  a  citizen  of  Maroneia  (IG xii  5 242.b.2).  I.Priene 10  (C 4)  is  a  decree  by  Priene  (no. 861) bestowing  various  judicial  privileges  on  citizens  of Maroneia.  A  citizen  of  Maroneia  was  Olympic  victor  in  476 (Olympionikai 213). The  poliad  deity  of  Maroneia  was  most  probably Dionysos,  whose  portrait  appears  on  coins;  his  sanctuary (Dionysion)  was  the  place  of  publication  of  official docu- ments  (SEG 35  823.43\u00ad4  (C 2)).  With  Dionysos'  cult  was apparently  associated  that  of  the  city's  eponymous  hero Maron  (cf.  the  legend  on  C 5f  coins  (infra)),  as indicated  by  their  joint  cult,  along  with  that  of  Zeus  and Rome,  in  the  Roman  period  (Triantaphyllos  ( 1983)  425).The cult  of  Apollo  is  presumed  on  legendary  evidence  (Hom. Od. 9.187\u00ad215). The  town  of  Maroneia  is  securely  located  in  the  well- protected  bay  of  Ag.  Charalambos,  which  also  served  as  the city  harbour.  A  vast  10.5  km-long  fortification wall protect- ed  the  entire  area  from  the  port,  west  of  the  bay  (reinforced to  the  east  by  an  artificial mole;  cf.  Sarla-Pentazou  and Pentazos  ( 1984)  47  figs. 2\u00ad3,  5\u00ad6),  to  the  acropolis,  identified on  the  hill  of  Ag.  Athanasios  (height  678m).  Archaeological research  has  not  yet  identified t races  of  the  Archaic\u00ad Classical  city.  The  isodomic  city  wall  was  reinforced  with numerous  semicircular  and  rectangular  towers.  Also  identi- fied are a C 4  sanctuary,  presumably  of  Dionysos,  and  the sanctuary  of  the  Egyptian  deities  (Tsimbidis-Pentazos ( 1971)  104,(1973)  84\u00ad86  fig. 1;  Pentazos  ( 1982)  29\u00ad30;  Sarla- Pentazou  and  Pentazos  ( 1984)  48  fig. 10;  Lazaridis  ( 1972) 40.140;  Pentazos  ( 1986);Ergon  ( 1973)  59\u00ad61,(1986\u00ad87)  44\u00ad45, ( 1987)  20\u00ad22;  Triantaphyllos  ( 1983)  431\u00ad32). In C 6l  Maroneia  struck  a  limited  series  of  silver  coins  on the  Thrako-Makedonian  standard.  Denominations:  stater, tetrobol,  diobol  and  obol.  Type:  obv.  horse  protome;  rev. incuse  square.  In  the  Classical  period  silver  coins  were  struck first on the Phoenician standard,  later  on  the  Persian  stan- dard,  sometimes  on  the  Attic  standard.  Denominations from  C 5e  on:  didrachm,  drachm,  triobol,  diobol,  tri- hemiobol.  Types:  obv.  forepart  of  horse,  or  prancing  horse, or  head  of  Dionysos;  rev.  first,  incuse  square;  later,  vine  or grapes  in  square.  Legend:  c. 500  on  obv. or or thrace  from  nestos  to  hebros  879 ,  later  on  rev. or but  mostly or  later  and  often  a magistrate's  name.  The  same  types  appear  on  bronze  coins and  on  two  series  of  gold  coins  struck  in  C 4f(Head,  HN \u00b2 248\u00ad50;  Sch\u00f6nert-Geiss  ( 1987)  46\u00ad47;  SNG  Cop.  Thrace 592\u00ad633).  The  dating,  seriation  and  distribution  of  the important  coinage  of  Maroneia,  as  well  as  the  systematic study  of  its  impact  on  political  and  financial developments in  Thrace  and  on  the  Odrysian  coinage,  have  been  based  on the  mints  of  Abdera  and  Ainos  (May ( 1965);  West  ( 1929) 55\u00ad147;  Sch\u00f6nert-Geiss  ( 1979),  ( 1985),  ( 1987);  Peter  ( 1997) passim).  As a  consequence  of  the  revision  of  Abdera's  mon- etary  history  (no. 640),  historical  conclusions  are  now  open to reconsideration. 647.  Mesambrie Map 51.  Lat. 40.50,long.  25.40,  but  see infra.  Size  of  territory:  probably  2.  Type:  A:?  The  toponym, \u00b5,  ,  is  attested  exclusively  by Herodotos  ( 7.108.2, quoted  at  Steph.  Byz. 446.19\u00ad21: \u00b5).  Herodotos describes  Mesambrie  as  the  westernmost  teichos  of  the peraia  of  Samothrake  and,  at  the  same  time,  as  a  polis  both  in the  urban  sense  and  in  the  territorial  sense,  viz.  as  bordering on  the  polis  of  Stryme  and  the  river  Lissos.  It  was  situated  in the  Briantike,  formerly  called  Galla\u00efke,  a  part  of  the  region formerly  owned  by  the  Kikones.  Herodotos'  description indicates  that  Mesambria  was  a  dependent  polis  belonging to  Samothrake. Mesambrie  was  tentatively  but  unconvincingly  identified by  some  scholars  with  Drys  (Perdrizet  ( 1909)  35;  cf.  Seure ( 1900)  152  n. 1),  by others  with  Orthagoria  (Meyer  ( 1976)  3, ( 1978)  97\u00ad98)  or  with  Zone  (Thrace  ( 1994)  80).  For  an  early discussion  of  proposed  unjustified identifications,  simplify- ing  the  admittedly  confused  settlement  pattern  transmitted by  literary  sources  for  this  area,  see  Robert  ( 1940)  and,  more recently,  Isaac  ( 1986)  128\u00ad33.  Mesambrie  has  persistently been  identified w ith  the  site  systematically  excavated  near the  stream  Shabla  Dere  (Kazarow  ( 1918)  33;  Amandry ( 1940\u00ad41);  Walter  ( 1942)  189\u00ad90);  Bakalakis  ( 1961)  15; Lazaridis  ( 1971c)  39;  supported  by  the  excavator  of  the  site, A.  Vavritsas,  and  followed  by  Barr.).  But  this  identification has  now  been  abandoned  in  favour  of  Zone  (Tsatsopoulou ( 1995)  671\u00ad73;  cf.  TIR 37;  Isaac  ( 1986)  131;  disputed  by  Soustal ( 1991)  354\u00ad55;see infra 881).  Mesambrie  should  be  sought  3 km  further  west,  at  the  mouth  of  the  stream  Yali  Dere (Meyer  ( 1976)  3;(1978)  97\u00ad98;  Mottas  ( 1989)  89). 648.  Orthagoria  (Orthagoreus) Map  51.  Unlocated.  Type: B: ? The toponym is ',  (Strabo  7  fr. 47),accord- ing  to  Pliny  (HN 4.42)  the  former  name  of  Maroneia.  The city-ethnic  is  attested  on  C 4m  coins  (infra), indicating  that  it  was  a  self-governing  polis  at  the  time. Orthagoria  has  been  unconvincingly  identified w ith  var- ious  locations  on  the  Aegean  coast,  usually  east  of  Maroneia (Robert  ( 1940)  87\u00ad90;  Lazaridis  ( 1972)  40.158,  46.164; Pantos  ( 1983)  171.27  and,  more  recently,  Isaac  ( 1986)  123,with refs.). Orthagoria  minted  silver  and  bronze  coins  in  C 4m  or later.  Denominations:  stater,  triobol  and  fractions  in  bronze. Type:  obv.  head  of  Artemis  or  Apollo;  rev.

", "Abdera": "Identifier: 641. , was  eventually  refounded  in  544  by  Teians  fleeing from  Persian  rule  (Hdt. 1.168\u00ad69;Strabo 14.1.30;  Ps.- Skymnos  670\u00ad71;  cf.  Isaac  ( 1986)  81\u00ad85,  with  an  interesting analysis  of  the  poems  of  Anakreon,  who  participated  in  the foundation  of  the  colony).  Pindar's  second  Paian  (Radt ( 1958);  cf.  Isaac  ( 1986)  85\u00ad86)  records  the  colonists'  success- ful  struggles  to  establish  and  extend  their  territory  until  C 6s, probably  even  C 5m  (Graham  ( 1992)  62\u00ad64);  according  to Strabo,  some  of  the  Teian  refugees  were  eventually  repatriat- ed  (Strabo  14.1.30;  cf.  Veligianni-Terzi  ( 1997)  692\u00ad93). The  history  of  Abdera  in  the  late  Archaic  and  Classical periods  has  been  largely  reconstructed  on  the  basis  of  the numerous  and  plentiful  series  of  its  important  coinage  by May ( 1966).  However,  recent  numismatic  research  by Katerina  Chryssanthaki  (diss.  Paris  IV, 2000;  forthcoming) has  brought  forth  evidence  which  leads  to  a  drastic  revision of  May's  dates,  and  consequently  of  his  historical  recon- struction.  In  anticipation  of  Chryssanthaki's  substantial revision  of  May's  seriation  and  dating,  the  following account  is  based  mainly  on  the  testimony  of  literary,  epi- graphic  and  material  sources  other  than  the  important numismatic  evidence. Abdera  rapidly  grew  into  a  major  financial power.  Its  sil- ver  coinage,  presumably  initiated  as  early  as  c. 540\u00ad35  (May ( 1966)  49\u00ad58;Kraay ( 1976)  35;  cf.  however  Chryssanthaki, forthcoming)  and  widely  exported  and  distributed  in  the East,  indicates  direct  access  to  rich  silver-bearing  Thracian regions  (Mt.  Symbolon,  west  of  the  Nestos  or  the  Thracian hinterland?).  Her  growing  rivalry  with  Thasos  became  man- ifest  during  the  period  of  Persian  occupation.  Following Dareios'  Skythian  expedition,  the  Thasians  were  denounced by  their  neighbours  for  planning  rebellion,  and  were ordered  by Dareios  to demolish  their  fortifications and bring  their  ships  to  Abdera  (Hdt. 6.46.1),  while  the  latter  city was  rewarded  with  the  Persian  king's  trust  and  friendship (Hdt. 8.120). Under  unknown  circumstances  and  at  an  unspecified date  Abdera  joined  the  Delian  League.  Numismatic  evi- dence  during  the  period  following  the  evacuation  of  the Persians  appears  to  indicate  a  further  increase  of  the  city's opulence,  especially  following  the  sedition  and  fall  of Thasos  in  463/2.  Abdera  belonged  to  the  Thracian  district and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.v.5) to 429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.30)  a  total  of  thirteen  times,  once  com- pletely  restored,  paying  an  exceptionally  high  phoros  of mostly 15  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  261.v.17)  reduced  to  10  tal.  from  432/1  on (IG i\u00b3  280.ii.46).  In  425/4  and 422/1  it  was  presumably assessed  for  tribute  together  with  Dikaia  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.153\u00ad4 and  IG i\u00b3  77.iv.29\u00ad30,  city-ethnics  completely  restored),  see infra. Abdera's  opportunistic  policies  revived  after  the  rise  of the  Odrysian  power:  with  the  Abderitan  Nymphodoros  as intermediary,  she  was  the  first t o  establish  relations  with  the thrace  from  nestos  to  hebros  873 Odrysian  royalty  (Hdt. 7.137.3;  Thuc. 2.29.1,  5).  The  purpose was  evidently  to secure  and  develop  her  exploitation  of Thracian  resources,  even  under  burdensome  financial obli- gations.  On  the  justifiably disputed t ribute  imposed  on Abdera  and  other  Greek  cities  of  the  northern  Aegean  by  the Odrysians,  see  Veligianni  ( 1995a)  and  Loukopoulou  ( 2002). The  same  Nymphodoros  extended  his  services  by  negotiat- ing  in  431  in  favour  of  the  Athenians  the  valuable  alliance  of the  Odrysian  king  Sitalkes,  not  least  the  ephemeral  rap- prochement  of  Perdikkas,  king  of  Macedonia  (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 165).  The  reduction  of  Abdera's  tribute  to the  League  by some 33  per  cent  in  432/1  may  have  been  a  reward  in  recogni- tion  of  Nymphodoros'  mediation  (Isaac  ( 1986)  102;  for  a  dif- ferent  interpretation,  see  ATL  iii. 310\u00ad11).  There  is  no satisfactory  explanation  of  the  marked  reversal  of  this  situa- tion  in  425,  when  Abdera  (with  Dikaia)  was  assessed  for  the enormous  sum  of 75  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.153\u00ad54).  Dissatisfaction and  unrest  among  Athen's  allies  in  the  northern  Aegean resulted  in  Abdera's  defection  from  the  League,  probably following  the  second  secession  of  Thasos  in  411  (Isaac  ( 1986) 105).  Abdera  was  brought  back  into  the  League  by Thrasyboulos  in  407  (Diod. 13.72.2;Xen.  Hell. 1.4.9;  cf.  May ( 1966)  181\u00ad83). In 376/5  Abdera  fell  victim  to  a  massive  invasion  of Triballians, allegedly  assisted--if not  invited--by Maronitans;  despite  untrustworthy  support  by  neighbour- ing  Thracians,  the  city  suffered  enormous  losses  and  was saved  from  complete  devastation  only  thanks  to  the  inter- vention  of  an  Athenian  squadron  under  Chabrias  (Aen. Tact. 15.8\u00ad10;Diod.  15.36.1\u00ad4).  An  Athenian  garrison  was established,  and  Abdera  became  a  member  of  the  Second Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.3  Tod 123;Diod. 15.36.3\u00ad4;  cf.  schol.  Ael.  Arist. 172.7,  173.17).  Still  suffering from  the  disastrous  effects  of  her  crushing  defeat,  the  city was  occupied  by  Philip  II  (Polyaen.  Strat. 4.2.22;  for  diverg- ing  opinions  on  the  date,  see  Isaac  ( 1986)  106).  In  346/5 Athens  granted  asylum  to  pro-Athenian  refugees  from Abdera (IG ii\u00b2  218). Abdera  seems  to  have  persistently  maintained  close  rela- tions  of  affiliation w ith  its  metropolis,  Teos,  down  to  the Roman  period.  Characteristically,  colony  and  mother  city shared  the  same  religious  festivals  (Herrmann  ( 1981); Graham  ( 1991));  Abderitan  coins  (and  amphora  stamps;  cf. Lazaridis  ( 1954)  169)  show  that  a  griffin was the city emblem of  both  poleis,  while  occasional  decrees  promulgated  in  Teos are  expressly  proclaimed  valid  also  for  Abdera  (Herrmann ( 1981)  from  Teos  (C 5f));  one  contains  public  imprecations and  seems  to  be  a  kind  of  citizen  oath  applying  equally  to Teians  and  Abderitans  (SEG 31  985).  Also  two  decrees  of Abdera  were found  in  Teos  (Herrmann  ( 1971),  ( 1981)). In C 5  the  constitution  was  presumably  democratic,  as  is indicated  by the  provision  that  confiscation of  property, imprisonment  and  capital  punishment  could  only  be imposed  by  a  court  manned  with  a  minimum  of 500  citizens (SEG 31  985.A.13\u00ad22;  Lewis  ( 1982)).Predictably,some  at  least of  the  institutions  of  Abdera  reproduced  those  of  its metropolis:  most  importantly,  as  in  Teos,  the  board  of  exec- utive  magistrates  in  Abdera  were  the  timouchoi  (Bousquet ( 1940\u00ad41)  100\u00ad107;C3m,  from  Delphoi).  As  in  Teos,  the  cit- izen  body  of  Abdera  appears  to  have  been  subdivided  in smaller  entities;  the  only  one  attested  in  Abdera  may  be  a subdivision  of  a  phyle,  perhaps  a  genos;see `\u00b5    in  a  C 4l  dedication  (Kallintzi and  Veligianni  ( 1996);  SEG 46  841).  The  eponymous  official was  presumably  the  priest  of  Apollo,  at  least  after  C 4m (Lazaridis  ( 1971b)  27,  140;  Thrace  ( 1994)  61).  The  names engraved  on  Abderitan  coins  (   ) are usually interpreted  as  those  of  annual(?)  mint  officials.  One  C 5s moneyer, \u00b5 ,  is  often  identified w ith  the  pre- Socratic  philosopher  of  Abdera  (Isaac  ( 1986)  103).  Other institutions,  including  the  boule  and  demos  of  Abdera (Herrmann  ( 1981))  and  magistracies,  are  only  expressly attested  in  epigraphic  sources  of  Hellenistic  and  Roman date. An  Abderitan  ambassador  is  said  to  have  been  sent  to  the king  of  Sparta,  Agis,  son  of  Archidamos,  in  the  latter  part  of C 4  (Plut.  Mor. 215  E).  Abderitans  are  awarded  proxenia  by Athens  (IG ii\u00b2  77  ( 378/7);  SEG 35  71  ( 332/1))  and  Kolophon (AJP 56  ( 1935)  363  l. 142  (C 4l)).  In  370/69,  a golden  crown  is recorded  as  offered  by the  Abderitans  to the  godess  of Athens  (IG ii\u00b2  1425.119  ( 370/69)).  In  359  the  city  had  a  theo- rodokos  to  host  theoroi  from  Epidauros  (IG iv\u00b21.  94.ib.28). Our  knowledge  of  Abderitan  legislation  is  limited  to  a  C 5 Abderitan  law  forbidding  the  burial  of  persons  who  had  dis- persed  the  family  fortune,  recorded  in  connection  with Demokritos  (Ath. 4.168b),  and  a  C 4  regulation  concerning the  marketing  of  cattle  (Feyel  ( 1942\u00ad43)  180,no.  2). Pindar's  second  Paian  evokes  the  organisation  of  the army  (with  emphasis  on  cavalry  units)  in  the  first days of  the establishment  of  the  colony  (Pind.  fr. 52b.104;  cf.  Isaac  ( 1986) 85\u00ad86).Some  indications  of  the  importance  of  its  size  can  be obtained  in  relation  to  the  battles  fought  in  376  against  the invading  Triballians  (Lazaridis  ( 1971b)  33\u00ad34  nos. 168\u00ad70). The  poliad  deity  of  Abdera  was  probably  Dionysos,  fre- quently  mentioned  by  Anakreon  (Isaac  ( 1986)  82\u00ad85).  Also important  was  the  cult  of  Apollo,  evoked  with  the  eponym 874 loukopoulou Derainos  or  Derenos  in  Pindar's  second  Paian  (Pind.  fr. 52b.5)  and  regularly  portrayed  on  C 4  coinage  (Isaac  ( 1986) 84  n. 65,  106\u00ad7).  Also  attested  in  epigraphic  and  literary sources  is  the  celebration  of  Thesmophoria,  Anthesteria, Herakleia  and  the  festival  of  Zeus  (Herrmann  ( 1981)),  the cult  of  Athena  Epipyrgitis,  probably  imported  from  the metropolis  Teos  (Lazaridis  ( 1971b)  27  no. 138;  Skarlatidou ( 1984a)  158),  that  of  Aphrodite  and  Hekate  (Pind.  fr. 52b.5; 78;  cf.  Isaac  ( 1986)  107\u00ad8),  and  a  grove  dedicated  to  the Nymphs  near  the  city  wall  (Lazaridis  ( 1971b)  41  no. 206);  for the  discovery  of  a  C 4l\u00adC3e  sanctuary  presumably  of Demeter  or  Kore,  see  Koukouli-Chryssanthaki  ( 1982)  3, ( 1983)  7;  Skarlatidou  ( 1984a)  159;  Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1987b)  180\u00ad82,(1988)  143\u00ad45,(1989)  222\u00ad23,(1992)  165\u00ad66). Further  attested  are  the  heroic  cult  of  Abderos,  celebrated with  athletic  contests,  excluding  horse  and  chariot  events (Philostr. 2.25;  presumably  to  be  identified w ith  the  hero Mesopolites  Epenor  (Kallintzi  and  Veligianni  ( 1996)  62),and that  of  Timesios  the  Klazomenian  ktistes  of  the  first c olony at  Abdera  (Hdt. 1.168);  in  C 4s,  Parmenion  is  said  to  have built  a  temple  for  Jason  (Strabo  11.14.12), Abdera  has  been  identified beyond any doubt w ith  the archaeological  site  near  Cape  Bouloustra  (with  visible remains  of  the  modest  Byzantine  town  Polystylon  on  its south-west  end),  some  7  km  south-west  of  the  homonymous (formerly  Bouloustra)  modern  village  (Reinach  ( 1881);  Regel ( 1887);  Kazarow  ( 1918)).  Despite  dramatic  geomorphological mutations  of  the  lowlands  from  the  alluvial  activity  and  the westward  movement  of  the  Nestos  estuary  (cf.  Strabo  7  fr. 43), recent  excavations  have  uncovered  parts  of  the  Archaic  and Classical  polis,  located  further  north  of  Cape  Bouloustra,  pre- sumably  on  a  promontory  linked  to the  mainland  by a  nar- row  strip  with  natural  bays  to  the  east  and  west:  identified are parts  of  two  early  phases  (C 7s\u00adC5:  Kokouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1987b)  177\u00ad83)  of  fortification walls protecting the city's por- tuary  installations  (a  neosoikos?),  remains  of  an  important public  building  (Koukouli-Chryssanthaki  ( 1991)  200\u00ad1), traces of  C 6\u00adC4  houses  and  the  C 7s\u00adC6f  (Klazomenian) cemetery  (Koukouli-Chryssanthaki  ( 1997)).  A  vast  Late Classical\u00adClassical  tumuli  necropolis  extended  to  the  north and  north-west  (Romiopoulou  ( 1964)  377;  Lazaridis  ( 1965) 460\u00ad61;  Triantaphyllos  ( 1973\u00ad74)  809\u00ad10;  Koukouli- Chryssanthaki  ( 1982)  9\u00ad16;  Triantaphyllos  ( 1975)  297\u00ad98). Two  gates  are  known  from  literary  tradition:  the  Thracian (Hippocr. 3.3.17)  and  the  Prourides  (Callimach. 4.90).  Due undoubtedly  to  the  changing  geomorphology,  the  site  was abandoned  in  C 4m  (Koukouli-Chryssanthaki  ( 1987a)  412), and  the  city  was  relocated  further  south,  where  systematic excavations  since  the  early  1950s  have  revealed  segments  of the  C 4  fortifications w ith  a  gate,  and  several  insulae  of Hellenistic  and  Roman  dwellings.  The  walls  enclosed  an  area of 112  ha,  and  the  city  was  apparantly  grid-planned  from  its foundation  (Hoepfner  and  Schwandner  ( 1994)  180\u00ad87).  Only undated  traces  of  the  theatre  (TGR  ii. 115)  were  identified (Lazaridis  ( 1971b)  38  no. 193;  Lazaridis  ( 1966)  359\u00ad61; Triantaphyllos  ( 1984)  32\u00ad33),  but  it  is  attested  in  a  C 2  inscrip- tion  (Avezou  and  Picard  ( 1913)  122\u00ad24,  128\u00ad29;  BCH 37  ( 1913) 122\u00ad37  (C 2))  and  mentioned  by  Lucian  in  a  C 4l\u00adC3e  context (Hist.  conscr. 1).  The  palaistra  (Hippocr. 6.8.30:  palaistrophy- lax)  remains  unidentified. Abdera  struck  high-quality  coins  from  C 6s  and  through- out  the  entire  Classical  period.  Its  mint  was  one  of  the  most important  and  enjoyed  a  wide  circulation.  Seriation  and dating  of  this  coinage,  established  by  May's  exhaustive  study ( 1966),  has  now  been  drastically  revised  following  import- ant  evidence  mainly  from  coin  hoards  discovered  in  various parts  of  the  East  (Price and  Waggoner  ( 1975);  Mattingly ( 1977)).  Since  the  results  of  recent  research  are  still  unpub- lished  (cf.  supra 873),  it  is  preferable  to refrain  from  repro- ducing  May's  conclusions  and  limit  the  presentation  to a summary  description  of  the  coin  types.  Abdera  struck  silver coins  on  variable  weight  standards,  of  mostly  large denominations:  octadrachm,  tetradrachm,  didrachm, drachm  and  subdivisions.  Type:  obv.  griffin t o left  (Abdera's city  emblem,  as  opposed  to  that  of  Teos:  griffin facing r ight), often  accompanied  by  various  symbols  (May  ( 1966)  86);  rev. incuse  square  and  later  various  representations  (portraits  or full-length  representations  of deities--in particular Dionysos--and symbols thereof,  animals  or  birds,  objects, fruits).  Legend:  full  or  abreviated  name  of  annual  magistrate in  the  nominative  or  in  the  genitive  case  after  ;  also,  at times,  the  city-ethnic  or .In addition  to  the  silver  coins  there  were  limited  bronze  emissions  from  C 5l,  presumably  for  local  use,  and  in  C 4m  a limited  emission  of  gold  coins  (SNG  Cop.  Thrace 308\u00ad73). 641. ", "Ainos": "Identifier: 642. , (Ainios) Map  51.  Lat. 40.45,long.  26.05.  Size  of territory:  probably  4  or 5.  Type  A: .  The  toponym  is  , (Hom.  Il. 4.520: ;  Hdt. 4.90.2;  Ant. 5.20;  Thuc. 4.28.4;  Ps.-Skylax;  IG iv\u00b21  94.ib.30  ( 359)).  The  city-ethnic  is (IG i\u00b3  260.vi.15;  F.Delphes iii.  1  497.6  (C 4l\u00adC3e); Thuc. 7.57.5)  or  (Hipponax  fr. 72.7,  West).  Ainos  is called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Hdt. 4.90.2,  7.58.3; Ephor.  fr. 39;  Ps.-Skylax 67)  and  in  the  political  sense  (Ant. 5.78).  The  town is  called  polisma  at  Ephor.  fr. 39.  The  collec- tive  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on  coins thrace  from  nestos  to  hebros  875 (infra)  and  externally  in  inscriptions  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.7  Tod 123)  and  literary  sources  (Thuc. 7.57.5;Dem.  23.119).  For  the individual  and  external  form,  see  IG ii\u00b2  152  (C 4f);SEG  38  217, Athens  (C 4);  IG iv\u00b2  1  58.7,  Epidauros  (C 4l\u00adC3e);  Arist.  Pol. 1311b21. Ainos  was  situated  in  the  Melas  Gulf,  at  the  mouth  of  the Hebros  delta  (Strabo  7  fr. 52),  commanding  the  exit  of  the vast  Hebros  plain  and  lowlands  famous  for  their  fertility (Plin.  HN 18.7.70).  It was  apparently  situated  in  close  prox- imity  to  the  Lake  Stentoris  (Hdt. 7.58.3),  on  what  was  prob- ably  a  peninsula  and  is  known  to  have  possessed  a well-protected  harbour  (Ps.-Skylax  67),  probably  a  river harbour  on  Lake  Stentoris Gala  G\u00f6lu  (Plin.  HN 4.43:  por- tus  Stentoris).  For  sketch  plans  of  the  Hebros  delta,  cf.  May ( 1950)  figs. 1\u00ad3).  The  harbour  served  communications  both with  the  Aegean  and  with  the  Thracian  hinterland,  as  the river  must  have  been  easily  navigable  (May  ( 1950)  1\u00ad7;  Isaac ( 1986)  140\u00ad46).  The  area  was  also  renowned  for  its  fishing banks  rich  in  large  mussels,  anchovy  and  pig-fish (Archestratos  frr. 7,  23,  Olson  and  Sens;  cf.  May  ( 1950)  6). The  extent  of  the  territory  of  Ainos  is  unknown;  attested however  is  the  existence  of  dependent  forts  (teiche)  on  the Thracian  littoral  south  of  Ainos  and  north  of  the  mouth  of the  river  Melas  (Ps.-Skylax  67). Ainos  is  already  known  in  the  Iliad  ( 4.519\u00ad20);  and according  to  Hipponax  (fr. 741,  Diehl  (c. 540\u00ad537))  the  leg- endary  king  Rhesos  was  king  of  the  Ainians.  Ainos  was  an Aiolian  colony  (Hdt. 7.58.3),  first established,  presumably  in C 7s  or  C 6f  (Isaac  ( 1986)  147\u00ad48)  by  Alopekonnesians,  subse- quently  reinforced  by Mytilenaians  and  Kymaians  (Ephor. fr. 39;  Ps.-Skymnos  697;Strabo 7  fr. 51)  on  land  (Apsinthis) owned  by  the  Thracian  Apsinthioi,  later  known  as  Korpiloi (Strabo  7  fr. 57;  cf.  fr. 51a). Undoubtedly  occupied  by  the  Persians  in  C 6l,it  recovered its  independence  under  unknown  circumstances  after  480 and  joined  the  Delian  League  as  a  tribute-paying  member (Thuc. 5.57.5;  cf.  May  ( 1950)  14).  It  belonged  to  the  Thracian district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3 259.i.23)  to  436/5  (IG i\u00b3  276.vi.29)  a  total  of  fourteen  times, twice  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 12  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 260.vi.15)  reduced  to  10  tal.  after  445  (IG i\u00b3  267.iii.2)  and finally  4  tal.  in  435  (IG i\u00b3  276.vi.29).  In  425  Ainos  was  pre- sumably  assessed  at  20  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.159,  ethnic  complete- ly  restored).  The  reasons  for  the  tribute  fluctuations as w ell as  for  the  absence  of  Ainos  from  the  full  panels  of 435/4  (IG i\u00b3  277),  432/1  (IG i\u00b3  280)  and  429  (IG i\u00b3  282)  remain  obscure (Meiggs  ( 1972)  249;  Isaac  ( 1986)  151\u00ad52).  The  army  of  Ainos included  peltasts  before  the  end  of  C 5  (cf.  Thuc. 4.28.4 (r 425)),  and  Ainian  forces  are  recorded  as  having  participat- ed  in  the  expedition  of  Sicily  (Thuc. 7.57.5). In 375,  with  Athens  once  more  the  undisputed  mistress  of the  Aegean,  Ainos  became  a  member  of  the  Second Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.7;  cf.  May  ( 1950)  187). Yet,  numismatic  evidence  has  been  interpreted  as  indicating a  decline  of  prosperity  since  early  C 4,  undoubtedly  aggravated  since  365  under  the  pressure  of  Odrysian  expan- sionism  over  south-eastern  Thrace  and  the  Thracian Chersonesos  (May ( 1950)  174\u00ad94).The  adverse  situation  was temporarily  averted  when  Kotys  I  ( 383/2\u00ad359)  was  murdered by  two  Ainian  citizens,  Python  and  Herakleides,  who  were handsomely  rewarded  by  the  Athenians  (Dem. 23.119;  Arist. Pol. 1311b22).  However,  the  improved  relations  between Athens  and  the  successors  of  Kotys  could  not  forestall  Philip II's  successful  advance  in  Thrace.  Renewed  aggression  by  the Odrysians  and  burdensome  contributions  imposed  by  the Athenians  could  be  exploited  by  a  pro-Makedonian  faction, active  in  Ainos  at  least  since  344/3.  As  a  result,  Ainos  went over  to the  Makedonian  king  c. 342  or  shortly  thereafter  and accepted  a  Makedonian  garrison  (Dem. 58.37\u00ad38;  cf.  May ( 1950)  195\u00ad203;Gehrke,  Stasis 16;  Isaac  ( 1986)  154\u00ad55). In 359  Ainos  had  a  theorodokos  to  host  theoroi  from Epidauros  (IG iv\u00b21  94.ib.30).The  two  Ainians  who  killed  the Odrysian  king  Kotys  in  359  were  awarded  Athenian  citizen- ship  and  proxeny  (Dem. 23.119;  Arist.  Pol. 1311b); Timaphenides  of  Ainos  was  granted  proxenia  in  Athens before  353/2  (IG ii\u00b2  152).  In  303/2  another  Ainian,  Alkaios, son  of  Heraios,  was  granted  Athenian  citizenship,  proxenia and  a  golden  crown  in  Athens  (IG ii\u00b2  495);  furthermore,  he was  honoured  with  the  proxenia,  ateleia  and  asylia  in Epidauros  (IG iv\u00b2  158). The  poliad  deity  of  Ainos  was  most  probably  Hermes Perpheraios,  whose  wooden  statue,  a  work  of  Epeios,  was washed  up  at  the  neighbouring  coast,  where  a  sanctuary  was presumably  built  in  his  honour  (Callim.  Ia. 7  fr. 197,  Pfeiffer; cf.  May  ( 1950)  272\u00ad73  for  C 5  coin  representations).  Pan  and the  Nymphs  depicted  on  a  C 4  relief  were  presumably  wor- shipped  in  a  cave  at  the  foot  of  the  acropolis  (Casson  ( 1926) 257\u00ad58).  Also  presumed  from  epigraphic,  numismatic  and literary  evidence  are  the  cults  of  Dionysos,  the  legendary king  Rhesos  and  Asklepios  (Isaac  ( 1986)  with  refs.). The  town  of  Ainos  is  securely  identified w ith  Byzantine and  modern  Ainos  (Turkish  Enez)  on  the  left  bank  of  the Hebros  river;  it  is  now,  following  extensive  geomorphologi- cal  changes  and  the  formation  of  a  sand-bar  blocking  the river's  mouth,  situated  2.5  km  upstream  from  the  modern coastline,  surrounded  by marshes  and  lagoons  (Hasluck 876 loukopoulou ( 1908\u00ad9)  249\u00ad51;  Casson  ( 1926)  256\u00ad57;May ( 1950)  1\u00ad2).The ancient  site  is  hidden  under  the  modern  town,  and  archaeo- logical  remains  are  sporadic. The  coinage  of  Ainos,  of  great  artistic  excellence,  was  ini- tiated  shortly  after  the  departure  of  the  Persians.  Ainos struck  coins  in  gold,  silver  and  bronze.

If  this  entry  can be  trusted,  Bergepolis  was  an  urban  centre  dependent  on Abdera.  The  second  part  of  the  composite  toponym  suggests that  it  was  a  polis:  viz.,  a  dependent  polis  lying  in  the  territo- ry of  Abdera. Otherwise  unknown,  Bergepolis  has  been  tentatively located--on no c onclusive  evidence--at the ancient site identified between K outson  and  Vafe\u00efka  (TIR 21  with  refs.; Triantaphyllos  ( 1973\u00ad74)  810\u00ad13,  and,  more  recently, Skarlatidou  ( 1990)  616).

Apart  from  Steph.  Byz. 230.15  there  is  no attestation  of  a  city-ethnic.  Dikaia  is  listed  as  a  polis  in  the urban  sense  alongside  Abdera  and  Maroneia  at  Hdt. 7.109.1 and  Ps-Skylax  67.  Polis  status  in  the  political  sense  is  con- firmed b y  her  coinage  (infra)  and  membership  of  the  Delian League  (infra). According  to Herodotos  ( 7.109.1)  Dikaia  was  situated  on the  Thracian  coast  between  Abdera  and  Maroneia,  near Lake  Bistonis  and  west  of  the  river  Koudetos  (Ps.-Skylax  67, to  be  identified w ith  Herodotos'  river  Kompsatos,  according to ATL  i. 517).  According  to  Strabo  7  frr. 43  and 46,  it  lay  in  a bay  near  the  sea-ward  side  of  the  lake,  which  served  her  as  a port.  It  was  situated  in  the  vicinity  of  the  legendary  palace  of Diomedes,  king  of  the  Bistones,  and  off  the  sea-ward  canal of  Lake  Bistonis  allegedly  cut  by  Herakles. Usually  sought  south  or  south-east  of  Porto  Lagos  (ATL  i. 517;  cf.  Bakalakis  ( 1958)  89\u00ad90),  Dikaia  has  been  located-- yet  without  any  conclusive  archaeological  or  epigraphic evidence  (Isaac  ( 1986)  109)--on a low hill named Katsamakia,  a  few  kilometers  north  of  Cape  Phanari (Bakalakis  ( 1958)  89;  Lazaridis  ( 1971b)  45  no. 223).At  this  site were  found  traces  of  part  of  a  C 4  fortification wall and sparse  remains  of  Hellenistic  houses  (Bakalakis  ( 1958)  68; Triantaphyllos  ( 1972)  535).  Some  C 6l\u00adC5  sepulchral  tumuli found  west  of  Katsamakia  have  been  attributed  to  the  city's cemetery  (Triantaphyllos  ( 1972)  535,(1973);  for  a  tentative demarcation  of  the  territory  of  Dikaia,  see  Lazaridis  ( 1971b) 46  no. 225). On  the  uncertain  evidence  of  sparse  archaeological remains  and  the  modest  amount  of  tribute,  the  population of  Dikaia  was  estimated  as  a  maximum  of 1,000  inhabitants (Samsaris  ( 1980)  168;  cf.  Lazaridis  ( 1971b)  51  no. 243). Dikaia  was  probably  founded  in  C 6,  but,  in  the  absence  of literary  testimonia,  the  origin  and  foundattion  date  remain obscure  (Isaac  ( 1986)  109\u00ad10).  The  bull's  head  on  Dikaia's coins  in  492  has  been  taken  to  indicate  a  Samian  origin  or, more  probably,  financial r elations  with  Samos  (May  ( 1965)). Dikaia  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from 454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.28)  to  432/1  (IG i\u00b3  280.ii.60)  a  total  of  thir- teen  times,  once  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 3,000  dr.  from  454/3  to 447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.ii.44),  reduced  to 2,000  dr.  in  446/5  (IG i\u00b3  266.ii.8)  but  raised  again  to  3,000  dr. (IG i\u00b3  280.ii.60)  perhaps  in  435/4  (IG i\u00b3  277.vi.19,  amount restored).  In  425/4  and 422/1  it  was  presumably  assessed  for tribute  together  with  Abdera  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.153\u00ad4  and  IG i\u00b3 77.iv.29\u00ad30).  In  425/4  the  two  members  were  assessed  at  the enormous  sum  of 75  tal. From C 6s  to  the  end  of  Persian  occupation  in  the  area, c. 476,  Dikaia  minted  two  series  of  silver  coins  of  excellent workmanship.  ( 1)  Series  I  was  struck  C 6l\u00ad480  on  the Thrako-Makedonian  standard  of  Thasos.  Denominations: tetradrachm,  stater  and  subdivisions.

Lat. 40.05,long.  25.40.  Size  of territory:  probably  2  or 3.  Category:  B:?  The  toponym  is ,  (Hecat.  fr. 160;  Ps.-Skylax 67;Dem.  23.132;  IG i\u00b3 77.v.29\u00ad30:   ).  The  city-ethnic  is (F.Delphesiii.1497.5  (C 4l\u00adC3e)).According  to  Ps.- Skylax 67,  Drys  and  Zone  were  emporia  lying  on  the  coast opposite  Samothrake.  Drys  is  classified as a polis  only  in  late sources  (Polyaen.  Strat. 2.22.3  (r 375);  Harp. 82;  Suda 1551; Steph.  Byz. 240.3).  Harpokration  is  quoting  Theopompos (fr. 161)  and  Stephanos  Hekataios  (fr. 160),  but  in  neither case  is  it  possible  to  ascertain  that  the  site-classification as a polis  stems  from  the  author  quoted.  In  the  Athenian  assess- ment  decree  of 422/1  Drys  is  listed  as  a  member  of  the  Delian League  and  assessed  at  1  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  77.5.29\u00ad30).  In  a  Delphic inscription  of  C 4l  or  C 3e,  the  ethnic  is  listed  along- side  other  ethnics  which  are  indisputably  city-ethnics  (F. Delphes iii.1479.5).The  presumption  is  that  Dryites  is  a  city- ethnic  too.  Thus,  Drys  appears  to  have  been  a  polis  from  C 5s to,  perhaps,  C 3e  (Robert  ( 1940)  81\u00ad87). Apart  from  its  membership  of  the  Delian  League,  the  only information  we  have  about  the  history  of  Drys  is  that  it  was a  fortified t own  which  in  375  was  besieged  by  the  Athenians under  Chabrias  (Polyaen.  Strat. 2.22.3),  and  that  in  c. 360  it was  the  home  of  the  Athenian  strategos  Iphikrates  (Dem. 23.132).  Drys  is  believed  to  have  been  absorbed  by Traianoupolis  under  the  empire  (Isaac  ( 1986)  129). Drys  is  tentatively  but  unconvincingly  identified b y some scholars  with  Mesambria  (Perdrizet  ( 1909)  35)  or  with Orthagoria  (ATL  i. 519)  and  in  turn  located  south-west  of Dikella  (Kazarow ( 1918)  52\u00ad55;  ATL  i. 518\u00ad19;  Bakalakis ( 1961)  15\u00ad16  et  al.),  at  Shabla  Dere infra  Zone  (Meyer ( 1976);  cf.  however  Robert  ( 1940)  86\u00ad87  and,  more  recently, Isaac  ( 1986)  129\u00ad30  and  Mottas  ( 1989)  89,  103). 645.

Il. 2.557;  Aesch.  Pers. 273;  Thuc. 2.93.4;  IG i\u00b3  1.2  (C 6l)),denoting  both  the  island  (Hdt. 8.76.2) and  the  town  (Ps.-Skylax  57;  cf.  Strabo  9.1.9).  An older toponym is (Aesch.  Pers. 570;  SEG 26  121.32  (C 1l); Strabo  9.1.9).  The  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  748 (C 5e);  Dem. 19.251).  Salamis  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban sense  at  Ps.-Skylax  57,  and  in  the  territorial  sense  (but  in  a mythological  context)  at  Cratinus  fr. 246.  Salamis  is  called the  metropolis  of  Cypriote  Salamis  at  Aesch.  Pers. 894.The collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  probably  attested  internal- ly  in  abbreviated  form  on  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  an Athenian  decree  of  C 4l  (IG ii\u00b2  1260.19)  and  in  literature (Aeschin. 1.25;Dem.  19.251).  The  individual  use  is  attested internally  in  sepulchral  monuments  found  on  Salamis  (IG ii\u00b2  10173,  undated)  and  externally  in  those  found  in  Attika attika  637 (IG ii\u00b2  10176  (C 4m))  and  in  literary  sources  ( \u00b5,  killed  by  the  Thirty  in  404  (Xen.  Hell. 2.3.39)). In C 6e  a  war  between  Athens  and  Megara  over  Salamis (Solon  frr. 1\u00ad3,  West;  Plut.  Sol. 8)  ended  with  an  Athenian victory  and  the  conquest  of  Salamis.  The  credit  for  the  vic- tory  goes  in  some  sources  to  Solon  (Plut.  Sol. 9;Dem.  19.251; Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 17.2),  in  others  to  Peisistratos  (Aen.  Tact. 4.8\u00ad12).  During  the  stasis  in  C 6f  Athens  seems  to  have  lost Salamis  once  again  to  the  Megarians  (Plut.  Sol. 12.5),  and  the dispute  over  Salamis  was  eventually  submitted  to Lakedaimonian  arbitration.  The  Athenians  seem  to  have invoked  an  allegedly  interpolated  line  about  the  Athenians in  the  Homeric  Catalogue  of  Ships  (Il. 2.558),  and  the Lakedaimonians  found  for  the  Athenians  (Plut.  Sol. 10; Arist.  Rh. 1375a29\u00ad30).  In  the  sources  the  Athenian  side  was represented  by either  Solon  or  Peisisteros  (Strabo  9.1.10), but  modern  historians  prefer  a  date  of  c. 520\u00ad510,associating the  Lakedaimonian  arbitrator  Kleomenes  (Plut.  Sol. 10.6) with  King  Kleomenes  of  Sparta.  For  a  full  account,  see Taylor ( 1997)  21\u00ad47. In C 6l  Salamis  was  settled  with  a  contingent  of  Athenians who  were  liable  to  pay  taxes  and  give  military  service  to Athens  (IG i\u00b3  1).  The  commonly  accepted  view  is  that  these Athenians  were  klerouchs,  although  perhaps  of  a  peculiar kind  (Cargill  ( 1995)  pp.  xxiv, 60;  for  a  different  view  see Taylor ( 1997)  63\u00ad74).  The  only  explicit  evidence  is  schol. Pind.  Nem. 2.19.  In  the  C 6l  Athenian  decree  concerning Salamis, [  ]\u00b5[   ]  has  been  restored by  most  editors  (IG i\u00b3  1.1  ML 14;Koerner ( 1993)  1).  More important  is  that  a  lease  of  confiscated property on L emnos of 387/6  compares  \"klerouchs  on  Lemnos\"  to  \"those  on Salamis\"  (Agora xix  L 3.33\u00ad34:      [---- ]      \u00b5[  ].  And  in  an  honorary inscription  of  c. 325, \u00b5   \u00b5 appears  alongside  \u00b5     \u00b5  (IG ii\u00b2 3206;  SEG 46  261;  cf.,  however,  Salomon  ( 1997)  96\u00ad101). The  epigraphic  evidence,  principally  sepulchral  monu- ments,  shows  that,  in  addition  to  metics  and  slaves  (IG ii\u00b2 1570.ii.42  (c. 330)),  the  population  of  Salamis  consisted  part- ly  of  Athenians  registered  with  their  demotics  and  partly  of so-called  Salaminioi.  A  good  many  tombstones  found  on Salamis  commemorate  Athenians  with  ordinary  demotics (IG ii\u00b2  7101  (C 4,  etc.);  Lys. 13.44;see Taylor ( 1997)  267\u00ad316, nos. 9,  10,  16,  18,  29,  etc.).  Some  two  score  tombstones  with known  provenance  were  set  over  Salaminioi;  a  few  were found  on  Salamis,  but  the  majority  in  Attika  (IG ii\u00b2 10171\u00ad215  with  addenda  in  Taylor  ( 1997)  263\u00ad316).  Who  these  Salaminians  were  is  still  a  moot  point.  No  link  can  be established  between  the  genos  of  the  Salaminioi  attested  in Athens  in  C 4  (IG ii\u00b2  1232  (C 4l);  Agora xix  L 4a  ( 363/2))  and the  Salaminioi  who  were  named  after  the  island  of  Salamis (Taylor  ( 1997)  47\u00ad63;  Parker  ( 1996)  312).Salaminians  named after  the  island  of  Salamis  must  be  distinguished  from Salaminioi  from  the  polis  on  Cyprus.  The  latter  are  some- times  specified as being  \u00b5      (IG ii\u00b2 10217\u00ad18  (C 4)).  Pace  Taylor ( 1997)  136,  264,  it  is  unbelievable that  all  the  tombstones  found  in  Attika  commemorate Salaminioi  from  Cypriot  Salamis.  Most  of  them,  perhaps  all, are  probably  Salaminioi  from  the  island  in  the  Saronic  Gulf (so  also  Osborne  and  Byrne  ( 1996)  272\u00ad76).  Finally,  in  spite of  all  the  prosopographical  information  we  possess,  there  is not  one  single  attestation  of  a  person  who  is  recorded  both as  a  Salaminian  and  as  belonging  to  one  of  the  Athenian demes.  The  only  evidence  of  an  Athenian  who  is  both  a Salaminian  and  a  member  of  a  deme  is  Moirokles  of  Eleusis (SEG 28  103.6\u00ad7  ( 332/1);  cf.  SEG 31  109A),  who  is  presumably identical  with   \u00b5  at  Harp. 36.He may  be  a  Salaminios  naturalised  by  the  Athenians,  like `  \u00b5  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 41.3),  or  he may  be  one  of  the  Athenians  living  on  Salamis.  The  sources do  not  support  Taylor's  view  that  the  ethnic  Salaminios  des- ignates  a  full  Athenian  citizen  who  happens  to  reside  on Salamis  and  that  all  Salaminians  were  inscribed  in  the  139 demes  (( 1997)  123\u00ad58).  The  population  of  Salamis  was  prob- ably  divided  into  Salaminians  and  Athenians  (for  a  parallel, see  IG xii.8  668,  a  decree  mentioning  side  by  side  the Athenian  demos  (sc.  on  Skyros)  and  those  who  live  on Skyros,  infra 774).  The  presumption  is  that  the  so-called Salaminians  were  never  integrated  into  the  Athenian  state. They  had  no  representation  in  the  Council  of  Five  Hundred, and  never  filled any other A thenian  office (Develin ( 1989)); they  are  not  attested  as  jurors  in  the  People's  Court  (Kroll ( 1972)),  and  were presumably  excluded  from  the  ekklesia  as well.  Both  groups  were  entitled  to  pass  decrees,  both  the demos  of  the  Athenians  on  Salamis  (IG ii\u00b2  3206  (c. 325))  and the  demos  of  the  Salaminians  (IG ii\u00b2  1260.19  (C 4l);  IG ii\u00b2 1225.4  (C 3m)).  The  eponymous  official was the  \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  1.7\u00ad12  (C 6l);  IG ii\u00b2  3093  (C 4e);  IG ii\u00b2  1227.1 (C 2s)),  who  was  an  Athenian  magistrate,  selected  by  lot (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 54.8)  and  paid  by  the  Athenians  (Ath.  Pol. 62.2)  like  other  overseas  magistrates. The  rural  Dionysia  were  celebrated  on  Salamis  (Arist. Ath.  Pol. 54.8;  IG ii\u00b2  3093  (C 4e)),  and  there  were  cults  of  the nymph  Salamis  (IG ii\u00b2  1955  (c. 320);  obv.of  C 4  coins  (infra)), of  Aias  (Hdt. 8.64.2;  SEG 26  121.32  (C 1l);  rev.of  C 4  coins (infra)),  and  of  Athena  Skiras  (Hdt. 8.94.2). 638 hansen The  town  was  situated  on  the  eastern  side  of  the  island, north  of  Kynousura.  It was  fortified,  but  the  C 4  circuit  wall was  rebuilt  in  C 3m  (IG ii\u00b2  1225.11\u00ad12)  and  later,  but  today only  the  faint  outline  of  the  walls  can  be  observed  (Haider ( 1989)  596).  In  the  town  was  an  agora  with  a  C 4e  statue  of Solon  (Aeschin. 1.25;Dem.  19.251)  and  one  of  three  monu- ments  commemorating  the  battle  of 480  (Paus. 1.36.1;  schol. Aesch.  Pers. 303;  Lycurg. 1.73;  IG ii\u00b2  1228.27\u00ad28  (C 1));  anoth- er  was  on  Kynousura,  where  remains  of  it  were seen  by Stewart  and  Revett  (Hammond  ( 1973)  304\u00ad10).  On  the north-west  tip  of  the  island  at  Boudoron  was  a  fortress  men- tioned  in  connection  with  the  Peloponnesian  raid  on Salamis  in  429/8  (Thuc. 2.93.4,  94.3,  cf. 3.51.2). The  Salaminians  struck  bronze  coins  in  C 4.  Types:  obv. female  head  (nymph  Salamis?);  rev.  Boiotian  shield  and sword  in  sheath  with  strap  (shield  of  Aias?).  Legend: .  The  beginning  of  this  coinage  is  now  dated  c. 400 (Kroll  and  Walker  ( 1993)  215).  The  legend  is  probably  the abbreviated  form  of  the  ethnic, (\u00b5),  indicating that  the  coins  were  struck  on  Salamis  by  the  Salaminians. Taylor ( 1997)  193\u00ad95  suggests  as  an  alternative  that  the  leg- end  is  (\u00b5) or (\u00b5),  and  that  the  coins were  struck  in  Athens  (Head,  HN \u00b2392;  SNG  Cop.  Attica 455\u00ad58). attika  639", "Athenai": "Identifier: 362. , (Athenaios) Map  59.  Lat. 38.00,long.  23.45. Size of  territory: 5.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is  ,   (Hom.  Il. 2.546;Ar.  Nub. 207;Lys.  6.25;  Pl.  Leg. 753A;  IG i\u00b3 1178.1  ( 433/2)),  in  Doric  (IG iv\u00b2  1  94.3  ( 359)).  The toponym  usually  denotes  the  town  (Dem. 56.9;  Ps.-Skylax 57),  but  sometimes  the  town  plus  its  hinterland  (ML  23.4; Din. 2.25)  and  sometimes  the  political  community  (Thuc. 1.44.2;  Pl.  Leg. 753A;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 19.4).  The  city-ethnic  is (Solon  fr. 4.30,  West;  Dem. 1.1;ML  15  ( 506),  27.2 ( 479/8);  CID ii  32.33  (C 4m)),  in  the  Doric  dialect   (IvO 30  (C 5)). Athens  is  called  a  polis  in  the  territorial  sense  (Thuc. 2.48; Dem. 10.63;  Din. 1.77;ML  23.4  (C 4m)),  in  the  urban  sense (Hdt. 7.133.2;  Thuc. 2.57;Dem.  18.204,  230;  IG i\u00b3  136.4 ( 413/12)),  and  in  the  political  sense  (Hdt. 6.106.2;  Thuc. 1.70.6;  Hell.  Oxy. 9.3;  Theopomp.  fr. 88;  Arist.  Pol. 1304a10;  IG i\u00b3  92.8  ( 416/15)).Polis  in  the  sense  of  akropolis  is  used  in  fixed idioms  down to C 4e  (IG i\u00b3  4B.3  ( 485/4);  IG ii\u00b2  17.10  ( 394/3), see  Henry  ( 1982);  Thuc. 2.15.6).  The  urban  centre  is  called asty  (Pl.  Phdr. 230D;  Dem. 42.7;  Hesperia  suppl. 29  p. 4.13), and  during  the  civil  war  of 404/3  the  oligarchs  residing  in Athens  are  frequently  referred  to as        (Lys. 12.55; Xen.  Hell. 2.4.7;Dem.  20.12);  the  term  polisma  is  found  at Hdt. 1.143.2  and  Aesch.  Eum. 668.  For  Athens  as  the  patris  of the  Athenians,  see  Solon  fr. 36.8,  West;  Plato  Com.  fr. 217, 626 hansen PCG;Isoc. 10.35).  A  C 4  epigram  describes  an  Athenian  kler- ouchos  as  having  a  double  patris:  viz.  Athens  and  Samos (CEG 594.10\u00ad11). The  collective  sense  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  inter- nally  in  abbreviated  form  on  coins  (infra),  in  inscriptions (IG i\u00b3  14.22\u00ad24  (C 5m);  IG ii\u00b2  1.3\u00ad4  ( 403/2))  and  in  literary sources  (Solon  fr. 4.30,  West;  Pl.  Euthphr. 2A;  Dem. 1.1)  and externally  in  inscriptions  (ML  25  ( 479);  SEG 33  440A ( 375/4))  and  literary  sources  (Pind.  Pyth. 1.76;  Hdt. 1.29.1; Hell.  Oxy. 1.2).  The  individual  use  is  in  a  few  cases  attested internally  (Thuc. 1.1.1;  Pl.  Prt. 311C),  whereas  attestations  of the  external  use  abound  (ML  27.2  ( 479/8);  CID ii  4.i.67 ( 361/60);  IG xii.5542.36\u00ad41  (C 4m);  Tod  196.5  ( 330\u00ad326)). Kleisthenes  wanted  membership  of  a  demos  (infra)  to become  part  of  an  Athenian  citizen's  full  name  (Arist.  Ath. Pol. 21.4),and  in  C 4  this  reform  had  caught  on  so  that,  inside Attika,  a  citizen  was  called  by  name,  patronymic  and  demot- ic  (IG ii\u00b2  5228\u00ad7855;  Whitehead  ( 1986)  69\u00ad75).  Klerouchies excepted (IG xii.6252\u00ad76:  Samos  ( 366\u00ad322)),  attestations  of the  demotic  used  outside  Athens  and  Attika  are  rare  (IG xii.5113  (C 4s  from  Paros)). In  the  Classical  period,  Athens  was  probably  the  most populous  of  all  the  Hellenic  poleis.  In  the  Persian  War,  Athens provided  9,000  hoplites  at  Marathon  (Nep.  Milt. 5;  Suda 545;  cf.  Paus. 10.20.2)  and  8,000  at  Plataiai  (Hdt. 9.28.6).  At Artemision  they  provided  127  ships  (Hdt. 8.1.1),  and  180  at Salamis  (Hdt. 8.44.1).In  431  Athens  had  a  field army of 15,800 men,  of  whom  13,000  were  citizen  hoplites;  a  defence  force  of 16,000,of  whom  3,000  were  metic  hoplites,  and  a  navy  of 300 triremes  (Thuc. 2.13.6\u00ad7;  Hansen  ( 1981)).  There  were  alto- gether  some  50,000\u00ad60,000  adult  male  citizens  (Rhodes ( 1988)  271\u00ad77;  Hansen  ( 1988)  23\u00ad25).  Due  to  the  plague  in 430\u00ad426,  war  casualties  during  the  Peloponnesian  War,  and the  siege  of 405/4,  the  number  of  citizens  dropped  to  some 25,000\u00ad30,000  in  c. 400  (Hansen  ( 1988)  14\u00ad28).  During  C 4 the  number  of  Athenian  citizens  living  in  Attika  must  have been  in  the  range  of 30,000, a  few  thousand  (Hansen ( 1985)  65\u00ad69;(1994)).  The  war  effort  in  the  Lamian  War  of 323/2  (Diod. 18.10.2,  11.3;  IG ii\u00b2  1631.167\u00ad74)  presupposes  that there  must  have  been  no  fewer  than  30,000  full  citizens  living in  Attika  (Hansen  ( 1985)  37\u00ad40;(1994)  308\u00ad10).  The  result  of a  census  conducted  by  Demetrios  of  Phaleron  during  the decade  317\u00ad307  was 21,000  Athenians  and  10,000  metics (Ath. 272C).  The  census,  called  exetasmos,  was  probably  a military  review  of  able-bodied  citizens  of  military  age (Hansen  ( 1985)  29\u00ad35;(1994)  301\u00ad2).  For  lower  population figures,  see  Gomme  ( 1933)  27:  43,000  in 431;  Ruschenbusch ( 1984)  and  Sekunda  ( 1992):  c. 21,000  in  C 4.  Numbers  of  free foreigners  and  slaves  fluctuated c onstantly  in  accordance with  trade  and  prosperity  (Xen.  Vect. 2.1\u00ad7;  Hansen  ( 1988) 10\u00ad12).  Ten  thousand  metics  were  counted  in  Demetrios' census  (Ath. 272C),  perhaps  an  army  figure r ather  than  a population  figure (Hansen ( 1985)  31\u00ad32),  and  comparing  the number  of  C 4  tombstones  commemorating  metics  ( 650,of whom 40  per  cent  are  women)  with  those  commemorating citizens  ( 2,110,  of  whom  35  per  cent  are  women),  we  can  infer that  there  must  have  been  a  sizeable  population  of  metics (Nielsen  et al.( 1989)  419;  Hansen  et al.( 1990)  26).  Down to the  end  of  C 4,  c. 875  citizens  of 149  different  poleis  (Abdera, Abydos,  etc.)  and  c. 150  persons  from  forty  different  regions and  islands  (Achaia,  Aitolia,  etc.)  are  attested  as  foreign  resi- dents  of  Athens  (Osborne  and  Byrne  ( 1996)).  Classical sources  testify  to  more  than  100  citizenship  decrees (Osborne  ( 1981\u00ad83)  D  1\u00ad25  and  T  1\u00ad82),  in  most  cases  indi- vidual  and  purely  honorific g rants  of  citizenship  to foreign notables,  but  foreign  residents  were naturalised  too  (T 30\u00ad31),and  especially  in  C 5  there  were  also  some  block  grants to,  for  example,  the  Plataians  in  427  (Dem. 59.104\u00ad5;D 1)  and to  the  Samians  in  405/4  (IG ii\u00b2  1.51\u00ad5;D 4).  We  have  no  reli- able  evidence  for  the  number  of  slaves,  but  rough,  exaggerat- ed  estimates  indicate  that  the  number  of  slaves  may  even have  equalled  the  number  of  free  (Hyp.  fr. 33,  Sauppe;  Ath. 272C;  Isager  and  Hansen  ( 1975)  15\u00ad18).However,the  estimate of 30,000  slaves  working  in  the  silver  mines  in  C 4s  is  on  the high  side  (Lauffer  ( 1979)  155\u00ad62).  Sallares  ( 1991)  57  suggests 11,000  max.  in  C 5m. This  is  not  the  place  to  survey  the  history  of  Athens,  and the  rest  of  this  entry  comprises  (A)  the  relations  with  other poleis;  (B)  the  constitution,  including  the  civic  subdivisions; (C)  the  Athenian  religion;  (D)  the  urban  centre  of  Athens, including  Peiraieus;  and  (E)  the  Athenian  coinage. (A)  Athenian  membership  of  leagues  and  large  alliances starts  with  the  Hellenic  League,  formed  in  481  against  Persia (Hdt. 7.132.2,  145.1;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 130)  and  the  Athenians  are recorded  among  the  victors  on  the  Serpent  Column  in Delphi  (ML  27.2)  and  in  Olympia  (Paus. 5.23.1).  The Athenians  were  the  hegemonic  leaders  of  the  Delian  League, 478\u00ad404  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 23.5;  Thuc. 1.95\u00ad97;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 132;  Meiggs  ( 1972);  Schuller  ( 1974)).In  the  years  404\u00ad395  they were  members  of  the  Peloponnesian  League  (Xen.  Hell. 2.2.20;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 211).  Between  378/7  and 338  they  were the  hegemonic  leaders  of  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League (IG ii\u00b2  43;  Paus. 1.25.3;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 257;  Cargill  ( 1981); Dreher  ( 1995)),  and  in  338/7  they  joined  the  Corinthian League  (IG ii\u00b2  236;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 403).  Athens  was  a  attika  627 member  of  the  Delphic  amphiktyony and  provided  ex  officio one  of  the  two  Ionic  hieromnemones  (Aeschin. 2.116;  CID ii 94.4  ( 328/7);  Lef\u00e8vre  ( 1998)  63\u00ad69).The  Athenians  possessed a  treasury  in  Delphi  (Partida  ( 2000)  48\u00ad70),  and  eight  com- munal  dedications  by  the  Athenians  have  been  found (Jacquemin  ( 1999)  315\u00ad16).  SEG 14  350  is  a  c. 500  dedication at  Olympia  ( [ ]~    \u00b5[]),  and  SEG 22  346 (C 5f)  is  one  of  Persian  spoils. The  Athenians  sent  out  heralds  ( ,ML  45.9  (C 5s)) and  envoys,  called  first  (Hdt. 5.73.1),  from  C 5s mostly (IG ii\u00b2  43.72\u00ad77  ( 378/7));  the  envoys  were sent  to other  poleis  (Thuc. 5.22.3)  or  to  monarchs  (Thuc. 2.67.2)  or  to federal  governments  (IG ii\u00b2  116,  176:  Thessaly  in 361/60)  or  to  international  peace  conferences  (Xen.  Hell. 6.3.1\u00ad3  ( 372/1)).Mostly  boards  of  envoys  were sent  out,  often ten  at  a  time  (Aeschin. 2.18  ( 347/6);  Mosley  ( 1973)  55\u00ad63).For an  (incomplete)  list  of  ninety-two  attested  embassies  sent out  from  Athens  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods,  see Kienast  ( 1973)  595\u00ad611.  Conversely,  foreign  embassies  were received  in  Athens  by  the  prytaneis  and  admitted  to  the  boule and  the  ekklesia  (IG i\u00b3  40.12\u00ad14  ( 446/5);  Mosley  ( 1973) 78\u00ad79).  Two  examples  are  envoys  from  Leontinoi  in  433/2 (IG i\u00b3  54)  and  envoys  from  Dionysios  I  of  Syracuse  in  368/7 (IG ii\u00b2  105).  Athenian  theorodokoi  hosted  theoroi  sent  from Delphi  in  C 5l  (Syll. \u00b390.16\u00ad17)  and  from  Epidauros  in  359  (IG iv\u00b21  94.ia.3). Athens  had  proxenoi  in  most  Greek  poleis.  To  the  end  of the  Classical  period  close  to  100  are  attested  in  inscriptions. These  proxenoi  are  citizens  of  sixty-three  different  Hellenic poleis,  of  two  Phoenician  city-states--Sidon ( IG ii\u00b2  141,  343) and  Tyros  (IG ii\u00b2  342)--and three w ere  the  kings  of Makedon  (Walbank  ( 1978)  1),of  the  Pelagonians  (IG ii\u00b2  190) and  of  the  Messapians  (Walbank  ( 1978)  70;  Marek  ( 1984), excluding 5,  8,  14,  21,  42,  53,  59,  65,  68,  72,  76  and 80,but adding  SEG 40  57,  72;  SEG 45  59,  76).  To  these  proxenoi  must be  added  all  those  mentioned  in  literary  sources  (Thuc. 3.2.3;Dem.  7.38,  etc.;  Monceaux  ( 1886)  321\u00ad23,  fourteen attestations).  Conversely,  in  the  same  period,  Athenian  cit- izens  are  attested  as  proxenoi  appointed  by  different  Hellenic poleis.  Thus,  in  C 4m,  Karthaia  on  Keos  lists  a  minimum  of fifteen and perhaps twenty different A thenians  as  their  prox- enoi  in  Athens  (IG xii.5542.35\u00ad45).  For  attestations  in  liter- ary  sources,  cf.  Aeschin. 3.138  and  Monceaux  ( 1886)  323\u00ad25, fourteen  attestations) Athenians  were  victorious  in  all  the  Panhellenic  games.  In the  Olympic  Games,  thirty-five v ictories  are  attested  cover- ing  the  period  696\u00ad328.  Victors  include  Kylon  ( 640?)  (Hdt. 5.71.1),  Miltiades  ( 560)  (Hdt. 6.36.1),  Peisistratos  ( 532)  (Hdt. 6.103.2),  Alkibiades  ( 416)  (Thuc. 6.16.2)  and,  perhaps, Demades  ( 328)(Suda 414);  see  Olympionikai 56,  106,  124, 345,  467.  In  the  Pythian  Games,  twenty  victories  from  c. 542 to 374.Victors  include  Chabrias  in  374  (Dem. 59.34);  see  Kyle ( 1987)  A 3,  4,  15,  17,  29,  30,  42,  43,  58,  71,P95,  107;  Krause  ( 1841) 105\u00ad6).  In  the  Nemean  Games,  thirty  victories  from  C 6l  to C 4e.  Victors  include  Alkibiades  (Paus. 1.22.6)  and  Lysis  (Pl. Lysis 205C);  see  Kyle  ( 1987)  A 1,  4,  15,  29,  42,  45,  57,  58,  64,  74, 78).  In  the  Isthmian  Games,  twenty-four  victories  from  C 5e to C 4f.  Victors  include,  perhaps,  Plato  (Proleg.  Plat.  Phil. 2, p. 198,  Hermann);  see  Kyle  ( 1987)  A 1,  15,  18,  29,  42,  57,  74,  78, P 86,P107  (Plato);  Krause  ( 1841)  222).  The  Athenians  organ- ised  the  Panathenaic  Games,  which  were  Panhellenic  (IG ii\u00b2 2311  (C 4f);  Pl.  Leg. 833A\u00adB;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 54.7,  60.3;Kyle ( 1987)  33\u00ad39).  In  addition  to  Athenians,  many  foreigners  are attested  as  victors  (IG ii\u00b2  2312  (C 4);  Kyle  ( 1987)  38  n. 28. (B)  The  Constitution  of  the  Athenians  is  the  only  surviving one  out  of  the  158  Aristotelian  politeiai  (Rhodes  ( 1981); Chambers  ( 1990);  Keaney  ( 1992)),  and  since  its  rediscovery in 1890  it  has  been  the  backbone  of  any  reconstruction  of  the history  of  the  Athenian  constitution,  starting  with Wilamowitz-Moellendorff  ( 1893). According  to  the  local  traditions,  Athens  was  originally ruled  by  hereditary  basileis  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 41.2,frr.  1\u00ad2; Hellan.  (FGrHist 323a)  fr. 23),  and  these  traditions  are  usually believed  to  contain  a  core  of  truth  (Carlier  ( 1984)  359\u00ad72). Kingship  was  replaced  by  government  by  magistrates appointed  from  the  rich  and  well-born  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 3.1:   ).  The  most  powerful  magis- trates  were  the  nine  archontes  (Thuc. 1.126.8:  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 13.3),  of  whom  the  chief  was  the  eponymous  official ( IG i\u00b3 4A.14\u00ad175  ( 485/4)).  The  Athenian  list  of  archontes,  published in  C 5l  (ML  6),  went  back  to  the  archonship  of  Kreon  in  683/2 (Hieronymus  p. 93,  Helm),  or  684/3  (Develin  ( 1989)  27\u00ad28)). According  to Herodotos  ( 5.71.2),  an  important  political assembly  was  the  prytaneis  of  the  forty-eight  naukrariai;but we do  not  know  what  a  naukraria  was,  nor  even  whether  the word  is  connected  with  naus  (\"ship\")  or  naos  (\"temple\") (Billigmeier  and  Dusing  ( 1981)).  That  Athens  had  an Assembly  of  the  People  is  extrapolated  from  later  evidence (Solon  fr. 36.1\u00ad2;  Andrewes  ( 1982)  387).And  the  Athenians  did not  themselves  know  whether  the  Council  of  the  Areopagos-- composed  of  all  ex-archons--had been instituted b y  Solon (Plut.  Sol. 19;  Arist.  Pol. 1273b35\u00ad41)  or  had  existed  long  before his  time  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 1273b41\u00ad74a3;  see  Wallace  ( 1989)  3\u00ad47). During  C 7  growing  social  and  economic  tensions  pro- duced  a  series  of  political  crises  from  about  630  to 530,of 628 hansen which  the  most  important  resulted  in  the  coup  of  Kylon,  the laws  of  Drakon,  the  reforms  of  Solon,  and  the  tyranny  of Peisistratos.  In  636  or 632  an  Athenian  called  Kylon  attempt- ed  to  set  himself  up  as  tyrannos  of  the  city.  The  coup  failed, Kylon  fled,  and  his  followers  were  put  to  death  (Hdt. 5.71; Thuc. 1.126.3\u00ad12;  Welwei  ( 1992)  133\u00ad37).  A  few  years  later,  in 621  (Develin  ( 1989)  31),Athens  acquired  its  first w ritten  code of  laws,  compiled  by  Drakon  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 7.1;  Arist.  Pol. 1274b15\u00ad16).  His  law  of  homicide  remained  in  force,  with modifications ( IG i\u00b3  104;  Tulin  ( 1996)  3\u00ad19),  right  down to the  time  of  Demosthenes  (Dem. 23.51);  but  the  rest  of  his laws,  whose  penalties  were  \"written  not  in  ink  but  in  blood\"  (Plut.  Sol. 17.3;  Arist.  Pol. 1274b15\u00ad18),  were  supersed- ed  in  the  very  next  generation  by  those  of  Solon  (Arist.  Ath. Pol. 7.1). In 594,  rich  and  poor  united  to  give  the  archon  Solon  ple- nary  power  to  dictate  a  compromise  (Welwei  ( 1992) 161\u00ad206).  He  began  with  a  general  amnesty  (Plut.  Sol. 19.4), then  abolished  enslavement  for  debt  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 6.1)  and gave  freedom  to  those  so  enslaved,  even  those  who  had  been sold  abroad  (Solon  fr. 36.8\u00ad15).  Next,  he  freed  the  indebted tenants,  the  hektemoroi,  from  the  sixth-parts  they  paid  to their  landlords  and  allowed  them  to  hold  their  land  free  of obligations  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 6.1;  Solon  fr. 36.3\u00ad6);  but  he  set himself  against  a  redistribution  of  the  land  (Solon  fr. 34; Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 11.2).  Besides  his  economic  reforms,  Solon also  reformed  the  administration  of  justice.  According  to later  tradition  he  set  up  a  People's  Court,  called  the  Heliaia (Arist.  Pol. 1273b35\u00ada3;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 7.3,  9.1),  manned  by sworn  jurors  (Arist.  Pol. 1274a3;  Hansen  ( 1983)  153\u00ad55,(1989) 242\u00ad49,  258\u00ad61  contra  Ostwald  ( 1986)  10\u00ad11)  and  gave  every party  to  any  lawsuit  the  right  to  appeal  to  the  Heliaia  against the  award  of  the  magistrates  (Lys. 10.16;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 9.1). Since  Solon's  time  the  Athenians  were  divided  into  four property classes:  pentakosiomedimnoi  (men  worth  500  med- imnoi  \"measures\"  of  natural  produce),  hippeis  (knights), zeugitai  (owners  of  a  yoke of  oxen)  and  thetes  (literally \"menials\",  day-labourers)  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 7.3).  The  thetes were  excluded  from  all  state  offices (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 7.3\u00ad4), and  to  the  most  important  offices the electors--probably the  People's Assembly  (Solon  fr. 5.1\u00ad2)--could appoint only citizens  from  the  top  two  classes  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 8.1,  26.2, 47.1;  Hignett  ( 1952)  101\u00ad2).  However,  of  Solon's  constitu- tional  reforms  the  most  important,  according  to  the  tradi- tion,  was  his  creation  of  a  Council  of  Four  Hundred, 100 from  each  of  the  four  tribes  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 8.4).  Solon  carried  out  a  new  codification of  the  laws  (Solon  fr. 36.18\u00ad20; Hdt. 1.29.1;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 7.1;  Rhodes  ( 1981)  130\u00ad35;frag- ments  in  Ruschenbusch  ( 1966)),  and  \"the  Laws  of  Solon\" were  not  revised  till  410\u00ad399,  when  they  were  recodified. Neither  side  was  satisfied w ith  Solon's  compromise (Solon  frr. 34,  37),  and  the  citizen  body  was  soon  split  into three  competing  factions  (staseis):  the  \"Men  of  the  Plain\" (i.e.  the  plain  around  Athens)  led  by  Lykourgos,  the  \"Men beyond  the  Mountains\"  (i.e.  beyond  Hymettos  and Pentelikon)  led  by  Peisistratos,  and  the  \"Men  of  the  Coast\" led  by  the  Alkmaionid  Megakles  (Hdt. 1.59.3;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 13.4;  Andrewes  ( 1982b)  393\u00ad98).  In  561  Peisistratos  became tyrant  in  a  coup  (Hdt. 1.59.4\u00ad6;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 14.1).  Apart from  two  long  periods  of  exile,  he  ruled  Athens  until  527 (Hdt. 1.59.3\u00ad64.3;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 14.1\u00ad17.2).  He  was  succeed- ed  by  his  son  Hippias  ( 527\u00ad510),  who  met  gradually  increas- ing  opposition  from  the  aristocrats,  many  of  whom  were forced  into  exile  (Hdt. 5.62.2;  Thuc. 6.59.4;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 19.3).  Two  of  those  who  remained  attempted  a  coup  in 514: the  young  Harmodios  and  his  lover  Aristogeiton  tried  to murder  Hippias  at  the  Panathenaia  festival,  but  succeeded only  in  killing  Hippias'  younger  brother,  Hipparchos.  They were  instantly  put  to  death  (Hdt. 5.55\u00ad57;  Thuc. 6.54\u00ad58; Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 18),  and  were  later  regarded  as  democratic heroes  (Thuc. 1.20.2,6.53.3;Ath.695B).Statues  of  the  tyrant- slayers  were  put  up  in  509  and  again  in  477  (Plin.  HN. 34.17 ( 509);  Marm.  Par.  (FGrHist 239)  A 54  ( 477)),  and  a  cult  for Harmodios  and  Aristogeiton  was  instituted  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 58.1). In 510  the  Peisistratid  tyrants  were  expelled  from  Athens, but  the  revolution  ended  in  a  power  struggle  between  the returning  aristocrats,  led  by  Kleisthenes,  and  those  who  had stayed  behind,  led  by  Isagoras.  With  the  help  of  the  ordinary people  (the  demos),  Kleisthenes  successfully  opposed Isagoras  (Hdt. 5.66\u00ad73),  and,  reforming  the  Solonian  insti- tutions  of 594,  he  made  Athens  a  democracy.  The  term demokratia  can  be  traced  back  to c. 470  (SEG 34  199;  Aesch. Supp. 604;  Hansen  ( 1986);  contra  Raaflaub ( 1998)  37)  and may  go  back  to  Kleisthenes'  reforms  of 508/7  (Hdt. 6.131.1). Kleisthenes'  major  reforms  were  to  divide  Attika  into  139 municipalities  (demoi),  which  in  turn  were  distributed among  ten  tribes  (phylai).  Citizen  rights  were  linked  to membership  of  a  deme,  and  a  Council  of  Five Hundred  was introduced,  with  fifty r epresentatives  from  each  of  the  ten tribes  and  a  fixed n umber  of  seats  assigned  to  each  of  the demes  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 21.2\u00ad6).  Finally,  to  avoid  a  new  tyran- ny  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 22.3)  or,  rather,  to  avoid  a  repeat  of  the power  struggle  of 510\u00ad507,  Kleisthenes  introduced ostracism  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 22.1,  3\u00ad4;  Brenne  ( 2001);  Siewert ( 2002)). attika  629 During  the  next  century  the  new  democracy  was  but- tressed  by  other  reforms:  in  501,  command  of  the  army and the  navy  was  transferred  from  the  polemarch  to  a  board  of  ten popularly  elected  generals  (strategoi)  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 22.2).  In 487/6  the  method  of  selection  of  the  nine  archons  was changed  from  election  to  selection  by  lot  from  an  elected short  list  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 22.5).  Ephialtes'  reforms  of 462 deprived  the  Council  of  the  Areopagos  of  its  political  powers, which  were  divided  between  the  Assembly  (ekklesia),  the Council  of  Five  Hundred  (boule)  and  the  People's  Court (dikasterion)  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 25.2).  Shortly  afterwards,  on  the initiative  of  Perikles,  political  pay  was  introduced  for  the People's  Court  (Arist.  Pol. 1274a8\u00ad9)  and  the  Council  (IG i\u00b3 82.20),  so  that  even  poor  citizens  could  exercise  their  political rights.  Athenian  citizenship  became  a  much-coveted  privi- lege,  and  in  451  Perikles  had  a  law  passed  confining citizenship to  the  legitimate  sons  of  an  Athenian  mother  as  well  as  father (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 26.4;  Patterson  ( 1981);  Hansen  ( 1985)  73\u00ad76). The  defeats  in  the  Peloponnesian  War  resulted  in  a  grow- ing  opposition  to  democracy,  and  twice  the  anti-democratic factions  succeeded  for  some  months  in  establishing  an  oli- garchy:  in  411  an  oligarchy  led  by  a  Council  of  Four  Hundred (Thuc. 8.47\u00ad98;Arist.Ath.Pol.29\u00ad33;Gomme,Andrewes  and Dover  ( 1981)  153\u00ad256),  followed  by  an  equally  short-lived mixed  constitution  in  411/10  based  on  5,000  enfranchised  cit- izens  (Thuc. 8.97.1\u00ad2;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 33.1\u00ad2);  and  in  404/3  a radical  oligarchy  under  a  junta  which  fully  earned  the  name \"the  Thirty  Tyrants\"  (Xen.  Hell. 2.2\u00ad4;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 35\u00ad38; Diod. 14.3.7).  In  403/2  democracy  was  restored  in  a  modified form  (Hansen  ( 1999)  300\u00ad4;  contra  Bleicken  ( 1994)  64\u00ad66). Legislation  (in  403)  and  all  jurisdiction  in  political  trials (c. 355)  were  transferred  from  the  people  in  assembly  to  the panel  of 6,000  jurors  acting  as  both  legislators  (nomothetai) and  judges  (dikastai)  (Hansen  ( 1999)  167\u00ad68,  181\u00ad83).  In the 330s  a  kind  of  minister  of  finance was introduced ( ho  epi  te dioikesei)  (SEG 19  119).  He  was  elected  for  a  four-year  period and  could  be  re-elected,  and  for  twelve  consecutive years  the administration  of  Athens  was  entrusted  to  Lykourgos  (Hyp. fr. 139,  Sauppe;  Burke  ( 1985)).  Most  of  these  reforms  were allegedly  a  return  to  the  \"ancestral\"  or  \"Solonian\"  democracy (Andoc. 1.83;Aeschin.3.257;  Hansen  ( 1999)  296\u00ad300),but  the gradual  and  moderate  transformation  of  the  democratic institutions  came  to  an  abrupt  end  in  322/1  when  the Makedonians  after  their  victory  in  the  Lamian  War  abol- ished  the  democracy  and  had  it  replaced  by  a  \"Solonian\"  oli- garchy  (Diod. 18.18.4\u00ad5). After  the  restoration  of  democracy  in  403/2,  more  specif- ically  in  the  age  of  Demosthenes  ( 355\u00ad322),  the  Athenian democracy  was  organised  as  follows  (Hansen  ( 1999) 55\u00ad295).  Political  rights  were  restricted  to  adult  male Athenians.  Women,  foreigners  and  slaves  were excluded (Dem. 9.3).An  Athenian  was  inscribed  into  his  father's  phra- tria  (infra 632)  at  the  age  of 3  or 4  (P  Oxy. 2538.ii.24\u00ad28),  and at  the  age  of 18  he  became  a  member  of  his  father's  deme (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 42.1;Dem.  30.15,  39.29),  with  his  name inscribed  in  the  deme's  roster  (the  lexiarchikon  gram- mateion:  Aeschin. 1.103;Harp. 17);  but  as  ephebes,  most young  Athenians  (Lycurg. 1.76;  Hansen  ( 1988)  3\u00ad6,(1994) 302\u00ad4;  contra  Rhodes  ( 1981)  503)  were  liable  for  military service  for  two  years  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 42;  Burckhardt  ( 1996) 26\u00ad75)  before,  at  the  age  of 20,  they  could  be  inscribed  in  the roster  of  citizens  who  had  access  to  the  Assembly  (the  pinax ekklesiastikos:Dem. 44.35).  Full  political  rights  were obtained  only  at  the  age  of 30,  when  a  citizen  was  allowed  to present  himself  as  a  candidate  at  the  annual  sortition  of magistrates  (Xen.  Mem. 1.2.35)  and  of  jurors  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 63.3)  (who  served  both  as  legislators  and  as  judges). In  the  People's Assembly  (Hansen  ( 1987a)),  called  he ekklesia,  any citizen  over  20  years  of  age  had  the  right  to speak  and  to  vote  (Xen.  Mem. 3.6.1).The  people  (demos)  met forty  times  a  year  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 43.3),  mostly  on  the  Pnyx hill  (Aeschin. 3.34);  a  meeting  was  normally  attended  by  at least 6,000  citizens,  the  quorum  required  for,  among  other things,  ratification of  citizenship  decrees  (Dem. 59.89),  and a  session  lasted  only  a  couple  of  hours  (Aeschin. 1.112).  The Assembly  was  summoned  by  the  fifty prytaneis  and  chaired by  the  nine  proedroi  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 44.2\u00ad3).  Apart  from some  obligatory  items  on  the  agenda,  all  matters  debated  by the  people  had  to  be  debated  first in the C ouncil  of  Five Hundred  and  passed  in  the  form  of  a  probouleuma  (Arist. Ath.  Pol. 45.4).  The  debate  consisted  of  a  number  of  speech- es  made  by  the  politically  active  citizens  (Dem. 1\u00ad10,  13\u00ad16), and  all  votes  were  taken  by  a  show  of  hands  (cheirotonia), assessed  by  the  proedroi  without  any  exact  count  of  the hands  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 44.3).  The  Athenians  distinguished between  laws  (general  and  permanent  rules,  called  nomoi) and  decrees  (temporary  and/or  individual  rules,  called psephismata:  Andoc. 1.87;  SEG 26  72.55\u00ad56  ( 375/4)).  The Assembly  was  not  allowed  to  pass  nomoi  (Dem. 1.19,  3.10\u00ad11) but  did,  by  decree,  make  decisions  on  foreign  policy  and  on major  issues  of  domestic  policy  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 43.6). Furthermore,  the  Assembly  was  empowered  (a)  to  elect  the military  and  financial magistrates (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 43.1,44.4), (b)  to  initiate  legislation  (nomothesia)  by  appointing  a  panel of  legislators  (nomothetai,Dem. 3.10\u00ad13),  and  (c)  to  initiate a  political  trial  (eisangelia  eis  ton  demon)  by  appointing  a 630 hansen panel  of  judges  (a  dikasterion:  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 43.4;Dem. 19.116). Citizens  over  30  years  of  age  were  eligible  to  participate  in the  annual  sortition  of  a  panel  of 6,000  jurors  (hoi omomokotes:Ar.  Vesp. 662)  who  for  one  year  served  both  as legislators  (Dem. 24.21)  and  as  judges  (Dem. 24.148\u00ad51). When a nomos  was  to  be  enacted,  the  Assembly  decreed  to appoint  for  one  day  a  board  of,  e.g., 1,000  legislators  (nomo- thetai)  selected  by lot  from  the  6,000  jurors  (Dem. 24.20\u00ad38; Aeschin. 3.38\u00ad40).  Having  listened  to  a  debate,  the  nomo- thetai  decided  by  show  of  hands  about  all  amendments  of \"Solon's  laws\",  i.e.  the  Solonian  law  code  of 594/3  as  revised and  codified in  403/2  (Andoc. 1.82\u00ad85).  Boards  of  nomo- thetai  were  appointed  only  infrequently,  and  to  legislate once  in  a  month  was  considered  excessive  (Dem. 24.142) (Hansen  ( 1999)  161\u00ad77). Jurisdiction  was  much  more  time-consuming  (Hansen ( 1999)  178\u00ad224;  Todd  ( 1993)).  The  People's  Court  (dikasteri- on)  met  c. 200  days  in  a  year.  On  a  court  day,  members  of  the panel  of 6,000  jurors  came  to the  agora  in  the  morning,  and by  sortition  from  among  those  who  presented  themselves were  appointed  a  number  of  courts,  made  up  of 201  or 401 judges  each  in  private  actions  and  501  or  more  in  public actions.  Each  court  was  presided  over  by  a  magistrate,  and  in a  session  of  some  eight  hours  the  judges  had  to  hear  and decide  either  one  public  action  or  a  number  of  private actions  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 63\u00ad69).  The  two  most  important types  of  political  trial  were  the  public  action  against  uncon- stitutional  proposals  (graphe  paranomon),  against  pro- posers  of  decrees  (Aeschin. 3.3\u00ad8),  and  the  denunciation  to the  people  in  assembly  (eisangelia  eis  ton  demon:Hyp. 3.7\u00ad8),  used  most  frequently  against  generals  charged  with treason  and  corruption  (Dem. 13.5). In  addition  to the  decision-making  organs  of  govern- ment  (ekklesia--nomothetai--dikasterion),  Athens  had about 1,200  magistrates,  called  archai  (Hansen  ( 1999) 225\u00ad45;  Develin  ( 1989)).  They  were appointed  from  among citizens  over  30  who  presented  themselves  as  candidates (Lys. 6.4).  About  100  were  elected  by the  ekklesia  (Aeschin. 3.14),  whereas  the  other  1,100  were  picked  by  lot  (Dem. 39.10):  viz. 500  councillors  and  c. 600  other  magistrates, often  organised  in  boards  of  ten  with  one  representative from  each  tribe  (IG ii\u00b2  1388.1\u00ad12).  The  period  of  office was restricted  to  one  year,  and  magistrates  selected  by  lot  could not  hold  the  same  office more than once (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 62.3).Prior  to entering  office,  magistrates  had  to  undergo  an examination  (dokimasia)  before  a  dikasterion  (Arist.  Ath. Pol. 55.2\u00ad5)  and,  when  their  term  of  office e xpired,  they  had to  render  accounts  (euthynai)  before  another  dikasterion (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 54.2,  48.4\u00ad5). The  magistrates'  principal  tasks  were  to  summon  and preside  over  the  decision-making  bodies  and  to  see  to  the execution  of  the  decisions  made  (Arist.  Pol. 1322b12\u00ad17). Apart  from  routine  matters,  the  magistrates  could  not decide  anything  but  only  prepare  the  decisions  (Arist.  Pol. 1298a28\u00ad32).  The  Council  of  Five  Hundred  prepared  busi- ness  for  the  ekklesia  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 45.4)  and  the  nomothetai (Dem. 24.48),  the  other  magistrates  for  the  dikasteria (Aeschin. 3.29). By  far  the  most  important  board  of  magistrates  was  the Council  of  Five  Hundred,  called  he  boule  hoi  pentakosioi (Andoc. 1.96;  Rhodes  ( 1972)).  It  was  composed  of  fifty  per- sons  from  each  of  the  ten  phylai,  who  for  a  tenth  of  the  year (a  prytany  of 36  or 35  days)  served  as  prytaneis,  i.e.  as  an  exec- utive  committee  of  the  Council,  which  in  turn  served  as  an executive  committee  of  the  Assembly.  The  Council  met every  day  except  holidays  in  the  bouleuterion  on  the  agora  to run  the  financial administration of  Athens  and  to  consider in  advance  every  matter  to  be  put  before  the  demos  (Arist. Ath.  Pol. 43.2\u00ad49.5). Of  the  other  boards  of  magistrates,  the  most  important were  the  ten  generals  (strategoi)  who  commanded  the Athenian  army  and  navy  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 61.1\u00ad2;  Hamel ( 1998));  the  Board  for  the  Theoric  Fund  (hoi  epi  to  theor- ikon),  who  in  the  350s  under  Euboulos  supervised  the Athenian  financial administration (Aeschin. 3.24\u00ad25);  and the  nine  archons  who  in  most  public  and  private  actions  had to  summon  and  preside  over  the  People's Court  and  super- vised  the  major  festivals,  e.g.  the  Panathenaia  and  the Dionysia  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 55\u00ad59). In  all  matters  the  initiative  was  left  to  the  individual  cit- izen,  in  this  capacity  called  ton  Athenaion  ho  boulomenos hois  exestin  (SEG 26  72.34;  Hansen  ( 1999)  266\u00ad68).  At  any time  about  1,000  citizens  must  have  been  active  as  speakers and  proposers  of  nomoi  and  psephismata  or  as  prosecutors and  synegoroi  before  the  People's  Court.  But  it  was  always  a small  group  of  about  a  score  of  citizens  who  more  or  less professionally  initiated  Athenian  policy  (Hansen  ( 1999) 268\u00ad72).  They  were called  rhetores  (Hyp. 3.4,  8)  or  poli- teuomenoi  (Dem. 3.29\u00ad31),  whereas  the  ordinary  politically active  citizen  is  referred  to  as  an  idiotes  (Dem.  Prooem. 13). There  were  no  political  parties,  and  the  people  did  not  vote according  to  the  crack  of  their  leaders'  whip  (Hansen  ( 1999) 277\u00ad87).  But  by  persuasion  and  charisma  major  political leaders  sometimes  succeeded  in  dominating  the  political assemblies  for  a  longer  period,  as  did  Perikles  from  443  to  his attika  631 death  in  429  (Thuc. 2.65.10),and  Demosthenes  in  the  period 341\u00ad338  (Dem. 18.320). The  ordinary  citizens  were  reimbursed  for  their  political activity as  ekklesiastai  or  nomothetai  or  dikastai  or  bouleutai (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 62.2;Dem.24.21).Very few  of  the  magistrates were  paid  on  a  regular  basis  (Hansen  ( 1979);  contra Gabrielsen  ( 1981)),  but  many  obtained  perquisites  instead (Isoc. 7.24\u00ad27;  Hansen  ( 1980a)).  Speakers  and  proposers  in the  political  assemblies  were  unpaid,  and  those  who attempted  to  make  a  profit out of  politics  were  regarded  as sycophants  and  liable  to  punishment  (Dem. 59.43). The  Council  of  the  Areopagos  was  a  survival  of  the Archaic  period  (Wallace  ( 1989)),  and  in  the  period  461\u00ad404 mainly  a  court  for  cases  of  homicide  (Philoch.  fr. 64).  In  C 4, however,  the  activity  of  the  Areopagos  was  again  progres- sively  enlarged  in  connection  with  the  attempts  to  revive  the \"ancestral\"  or  \"Solonian\"  democracy  (Din. 1.62\u00ad63;  Lycurg. 1.52;  Hansen  ( 1989)). Athenian  civic  subdivisions  comprise  phylai,  trittyes, demoi  and  phratriai  (Jones  ( 1999)  51\u00ad220).  During  the  periods  covered  by  our  sources  neither  the  genos  (Parker ( 1996)  59\u00ad65)  nor  the  oikos  (Hansen  ( 1998)  135\u00ad37)  was  a civic  subdivision  in  the  proper  sense.  In  the  Archaic  period the  Athenian  citizens  were  organised  into  four  phylai:  viz. Geleontes,  Argadeis,  Aigikoreis  and  Hopletes  (Hdt. 5.66.2). Each  phyle  was  headed  by  a  \"king\"  (phylobasileus)  and  sub- divided  into  three  trittyes  and  twelve  naukrariai  (Arist.  Ath. Pol. 8.3).  This  organisation  was  still  maintained  in  C 4  for religious  purposes  (Hesperia 4  ( 1935)  19\u00ad32  no. 2.33\u00ad35).  In the  years  after  508/7  Kleisthenes  implemented  a  new  organ- isation  whereby  Attika  was  divided  partly  into  three  dis- tricts--the t own  of  Athens  with  its  immediate  hinterland (asty),  the  coast  (paralia),  and  the  inland  (mesogeia)--and partly  into  139  municipalities  of  varying  size,  called  demoi. Each  demos  was  headed  by  a  demarchos,  and  many  had  a nucleated  centre  where  the  members  held  their  meetings, called  agorai  (Osborne  ( 1985);  Whitehead  ( 1986)).  Next,  the 139  demoi  were  distributed  over  thirty  trittyes,  with  ten  trit- tyes  in  each  of  the  three  districts.  Each  trittys  consisted  of from  one  to ten  demoi  (Siewert  ( 1982)).  Finally,  ten  phylai were  formed,  each  consisting  of  three  trittyes,  one  picked  by lot  (Hansen  ( 1987b))  from  each  of  the  three  districts.  The  ten phylai  were  named  after  local  heroes  and  called  Erechtheis, Aigeis,  Pandionis,  Leontis,  Akamantis,  Oineis,  Kekropis, Hippothontis,  Aiantis  and  Antiochis  (Jones  ( 1999)  151\u00ad94). All  these  civic  subdivisions  were  basically  territorial,  but membership  was  hereditary  (Hdt. 5.69;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 21.2\u00ad4;Arist.Pol.1319b19\u00ad27;  Traill  ( 1975),(1986)).According to Traill  ( 1986)  123,  there  were  140  demes,  Acharnai  being  a divided  deme,  but  see  Whitehead  ( 1987)  443.  In  the  Archaic period,  all  Athenians  were  organised  into  phratriai  (IG i\u00b3 104.18,  23  (C 7l)),  gentilician  groups  with  hereditary  mem- bership,  but  also  locally  based  (Lambert  ( 1993);  Jones  ( 1999) 195\u00ad220).  This  system  persisted  in  the  Classical  period  and was  not  co-ordinated  with  the  distribution  into  demes. Thus,  Theodoros  of  Dekeleia  (LGPN  no. 96)  and  Pantakles of  Oion  (LGPN  no. 19)  both  belonged  to  the  phratria  of  the Demotionidai  (IG ii\u00b2  1237.2,  11  ( 396/5)). (C)  The  patron  divinity  of  Athens  was  Athena,  in  this  func- tion  called  \"Athena  who  watches  over  Athens\"  (  \u00b5:ML  23.4\u00ad5  (C 4m  but  r 480)),  or  Athena Poliouchos  (Ar.  Eq. 581\u00ad85)  or  Athena  Polias  (Aeschin. 2.147),  an  epithet  which  originally  denoted  the  akropolis rather  than  the  polis  (Cole  ( 1995)  301\u00ad2).  Athena  was  wor- shipped  under  many  different  forms,  each  specified b y  an epithet  denoting  function  or  origin,  and  each  manifestation of  Athena  had  its  own  sanctuary,  its  own  personnel  and  its own  rites.  In  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  at  least  seven- teen  different  manifestations  are  attested:  viz.  Athena  Areia (Paus. 1.28.5),  Boulaia  (Ant. 6.45),  Epi  Palladio  (IG i\u00b3  369.71 ( 423/2)),  Ergane  (IG i\u00b2  561  (C 4)),  Hephaistia  (IG ii\u00b2  223B.4 ( 343/2)),Hippia  (Paus. 1.30.4;cf.Thuc.8.67.2),Hygieia  (IG i\u00b3 506  (C 5m)),  Itonia  (IG i\u00b3  383.151\u00ad52  ( 429/8)),  Lemnia  (Paus. 1.28.3),  Nike  (IG i\u00b3  36.5\u00ad6  ( 424/3)),  Pallas  (IG i\u00b3  647  (C 6l)), Pallenis  (IG i\u00b3  383.121\u00ad22  ( 429/8)),  Parthenos  (IG i\u00b3  850 (C 5f)),  Phratria  (IG ii\u00b2  2344.1  (C 4e)),  Polias  (IG i\u00b3  375.6 ( 410/9)),  Poliouchos  (IG i\u00b3  775  (C 5e))  and  Zosteria  (IG i\u00b3 369.92  ( 423/2)).  For  the  other  gods,  see  Nilsson  ( 1967) 383\u00ad601. In  addition  to  the  cults  of  all  the  gods,  there  were  cults  of heroes,  of  whom  some  300  are  attested  in  the  sources (Kearns  ( 1989)  139\u00ad207),  ranging  from  Herakles  (Dem. 19.125;Harp. 14;  Woodford  ( 1971))  to  the  poet  Sophokles under  the  name  of  Dexion  (Etym.  Magn. 256.6\u00ad12;Kearns ( 1989)  154). During  the  democracy  many  new  cults  were  introduced. Some  of  them  were  purely  or  primarily  political,  viz.  the cults  of  the  tyrannicides  Harmodios  and  Aristogeiton (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 58.1),  of  the  ten  eponymous  heroes  (IG ii\u00b2 1140  (C 4e);  Kron  ( 1976)),  of  Zeus  Boulaios  and  Athena Boulaia  in  the  bouleuterion  (Ant. 6.45),  of  Zeus  Eleutherios, connected  with  the  victory  over  the  Persians  at  Plataiai (Thuc. 2.71.2;  Raaflaub ( 1985)  125\u00ad47),of  Theseus  in  the  (still unlocated)  Theseion  (Aeschin. 3.13),reformed  c. 475  with  the recovery  of  his  bones  (Plut.  Thes. 36.2)  and  culminating  in 632 hansen C 4  with  Theseus  seen  as  the  father  of  Athenian  democracy (Dem. 59.75;  Paus. 1.3.3\u00ad4;  Garland  ( 1992)  82\u00ad98),  and  in  C 4 of  Demokratia,  democracy  personified ( IG ii\u00b2  1496.131\u00ad41 ( 332/1);  Alexandri-Zahou  ( 1986)).  Other  new  cults  were those  of  foreign  gods,  such  as  Thracian  Bendis  (Pl.  Resp. 327A\u00ad28A;  Simms  ( 1988)),  or  cults  of  gods  of  foreigners, such  as  Phoenician  Aphrodite  worshipped  by  Kitians,  or  Isis worshipped  by  Egyptians  (IG ii\u00b2  337  RO 91  ( 333/2)). A  substantial  part  of  the  Athenian  law  code  consisted  of  a sacrificial calendar r egulating  all  public  sacrifices ( Hesperia 4  ( 1935)  5\u00ad32;Lys.  30.18;  Clinton  ( 1982)),  and  of  the  c. 600 civilian  archai,  some  200  were  exclusively  or  principally engaged  in  the  administration  of  the  sanctuaries  and  organ- isation  of  the  sacrifices and festivals in honour of  the  divin- ity  of  the  sanctuary  in  question  (Hansen  ( 1980b)  155, 162\u00ad63).  The  rites  were  performed  by  priests  (hiereis)  and priestesses  (hiereiai)  who  were  not  themselves  archai  (Dem. Prooem. 55.2;  Busolt  and  Swoboda  ( 1926)  1171).  In  the Archaic  period,  all  public  priesthoods  were  filled for life from  among  members  of  the  gene,  hereditary  groups  of upper-class  Athenians,  based  on  descent  in  the  male  line  and apparently  subdivisions  of  the  phratriai  (Aeschin. 2.147;  IG i\u00b3  6  (C 5f);  Parker  ( 1996)  56\u00ad66,284\u00ad327).In the  course  of  the Classical  period  the  democratic  polis  took  over,  and  an increasing  number  of  priesthoods  were  filled from among all  Athenians.  The  first attested e xample  is  the  priestess  of Athena  Nike (IG i\u00b3  35  ML 44  (C 5m)). In  a  year  of 354  days,  some  60  days  were devoted  to annu- al  festivals  (Mikalson  ( 1975))  paid  for  by  the  polis  and  organ- ised  by  polis  officials (Deubner ( 1966)).  The  Athenian festival  calendar  is  different  from,  but  closely  related  to,  the Ionian  calendar:  the  Athenian  months  of  Poseideon  and Anthesterion  are  found  in  many  Ionian  poleis,but Mounychion  is  peculiar  to  Athens,  and  the  common  Ionian months  of  Artemision  and  Apatourion  are  not  found  in Athens  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 6\u00ad18). The  major  Athenian  festivals  were:  (a)  Panathenaia:  a  fes- tival  of  the  goddess  Athena,  celebrated  in  the  days  around her  birthday  on  28  Hekatombaion  (schol.  Pl.  Resp. 327A). The  Athenians  distinguished  between  the  Greater Panathenaia,  introduced  in  566/5  and  held  every  four  years (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 18.2\u00ad3,  60.1\u00ad3;  IG ii\u00b2  2311\u00ad12  (C 4f)),  and  the Lesser  Panathenaia,  celebrated  in  the  other  three  years (Agora xvi  75  (C 4s)).At  the  Greater  Panathenaia  Athena  was honoured  with  a  grand  procession,  Panhellenic  athletic competitions  (IG ii\u00b2  2311\u00ad12  (C 4f);  Neils  ( 1992)),  and  recita- tion  of  the  Homeric  poems  (Lycurg. 1.102;  Jensen  ( 1980) 145\u00ad49).  (b)  The  Eleusinian  Mysteries:  a  festival  of  Demeter and  Persephone,  celebrated  in  Athens  and  Eleusis  in  the month  of  Boedromion  and  restricted  to  those  who  had been,  or  wished  to  be,  initiated  into  the  Mysteries  (with  no distinction  drawn  between  citizens,  foreigners  and  slaves) (SEG 30  61  (C 4m);  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 57.1;  Andoc. 1.110ff; Clinton  ( 1974)).  (c)  Thesmophoria:  a  fertility  festival,  cele- brated  in  the  month  of  Pyanopsion  on  the  Pnyx  by married women  of  citizen  status  in  honour  of  Demeter  (schol.  Ar. Thesm. 80;  Brumfield ( 1985)  70\u00ad103).  (d)  Apatouria:  a  festi- val  celebrated  in  the  phratriai  in  the  month  of  Pyanopsion (schol.  Ar.  Ach. 146).  On  the  third  day  of  the  festival  citizens had  their  sons  registered  in  their  phratries  (Dem. 39.4),  and their  daughters  were  presented  to  the  members  (Isae. 3.73, 76,  79;  Cole  ( 1984)  233\u00ad37).  (e)  Ta  kat'  agrous  Dionysia:  the rural  Dionysia  were celebrated  in  the  month  of  Poseideon  in all  the  demes  (SEG 33  147.31  (C 4f)).  The  principal  ceremony was  a  phallic  procession  (Ar.  Ach. 241\u00ad83;  Whitehead  ( 1986) 212\u00ad22).  (f)  Anthesteria:  a  festival  of  Dionysos  celebrated  in the  month  of  Anthesterion  when  the  Athenians  opened  and drank  the  new  wine  (Plut.  Mor. 655E)  and  celebrated  a  cere- monial  wedding  between  Dionysos  and  the  wife  of  the archon  basileus  (Dem. 59.74\u00ad84;  Hamilton  ( 1992)).  (g)  Ta en astei  Dionysia:  the  Greater  Dionysia,  celebrated  in  the month  of  Elaphebolion  for  Dionysos  Eleuthereus,  whose sanctuary  was  situated  on  the  south  slope  of  the  Acropolis. In  addition  to  phallic  and  other  processions,  the  Greater Dionysia  were  the  setting  for  performances  of  tragedies, comedies,  satyr  plays  and  dithyrambs  (IG ii\u00b2  2319\u00ad23  (C 3e, rC 4);  Pickard-Cambridge  ( 1968)).(h)  Thargelia:  a  festival  of Apollo,  celebrated  in  the  month  of  Thargelion.  Two  scape- goats  (pharmakoi)  were  driven  out  of  the  city.  The  festival included  a  procession  and  choral  competitions  for  choirs  of men  and  boys  (Ant. 6.11\u00ad13;Harp. 5;  Bremmer  ( 1983)).  (i) Dipolieia:  a  festival  of  Zeus  Polieus,  celebrated  in  the  month of  Skirophorion.  The  sacrifice of  a  bull  with  an  axe  was  fol- lowed  by  a  ceremonial  homicide  trial  of  the  axe,  conducted before  the  Court  of  the  Prytaneion  (Paus. 1.24.4,  28.10;Parke ( 1977)  162\u00ad67). (D)  Settlements  beneath  the  Acropolis  can  be  traced  back to C 8  (Lang  ( 1996)  152\u00ad63),  and  Snodgrass  ( 1987\u00ad89)  60\u00ad62 has  classified A thens  as  an  instance  of  his  \"Model  B\"( 56),viz. \"a  sprawling  loose-knit  group  of  settlements\"  which  over time  grew  to  form  a  conurbation.  The  change  from  a  group of  small  villages  to  a  conurbation  took  place  when  the  lower town  was  enclosed  with  a  defence  circuit  (infra).  The  agora of  the  Archaic  town  with  the  prytaneion  and  the  Theseion (Paus. 1.17\u00ad18)  lay  north-east  of  the  Acropolis  (Dontas attika  633 ( 1983)).  Both  the  Acropolis  and  the  lower  town  were  sacked and  burnt  down by the  Persians  in  480  (Hdt. 8.53.2)  and again  in  479  (Hdt. 9.13.2).  For  archaeological  remains  of  the Persian  destruction  of  the  Akropolis,  see  Hurwit  ( 1999)  136. During  the  Dark  Ages  and  the  early  Archaic  period  the only  fortification was the C 13l  cyclopean  walls  of  the Acropolis  (Hurwit  ( 1999)  74\u00ad80).  In  C 6l,  however,  the  town had  a  separate  defence  circuit  (Thuc. 6.57.1\u00ad3),  demolished by  the  Persians  in  480/79  (Hdt. 9.13.2;  Thuc. 1.89.3,  93.2). This  wall  may  have been  constructed  in  C 6f  (Vanderpool ( 1974);  Weir  ( 1995)),  but  no  traces  have  yet  been  found.  In spite  of  Spartan  protests,  a  new  larger  wall  was  built  in  479/8 (Thuc. 1.89.3\u00ad93.2).  This  so-called  Themistoklean  wall  was built  of  mudbrick  on  a  stone  socle  with  seventeen  gates  and numerous  interval  towers  (Wycherley  ( 1978)  11\u00ad18;Judeich ( 1931)  124\u00ad44).  It  was  repaired  twice  in  the  Classical  period: in  the  years  395/4\u00ad392/1  at  the  instigation  of  Konon  (Xen. Hell. 4.8.9\u00ad10)  and  again  in  338/7  at  the  instigation  of Demosthenes  (Aeschin. 3.27;Dem.  18.300);  both  repairs  are visible  in  the  preserved  part  of  the  wall  at  Kerameikos  (Ohly ( 1965)  360\u00ad76).  The  line  of  the  Themistoklean  wall  has  been accurately  traced,  and  it  can  be  established  that  it  enclosed an  area  of  almost  211  ha.  The  walls  of  Peiraieus  were  first built  by  Themistokles  during  his  archonship  in  493/2  (Thuc. 1.93.3),  but  demolished  in  480/79  (supra),  then  rebuilt  in 479/8  (Thuc. 1.93.3\u00ad8).  The  walls,  of  polygonal  masonry (Garland  ( 1987)  163\u00ad65),  were  60  stades  long  (Thuc. 2.13.7) and  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 305  ha.  The  Long  Walls  were built in  the  years  458\u00ad457.  The  northern  wall  ran  from  Athens  to Peiraieus,  the  southern  wall  from  Athens  to  Phaleron  (Thuc. 1.107.1  and 108.2).  A  new  wall,  running  parallel  to  the  north- ern  wall,  c. 184  m  to  the  south,  was  built  c. 445  (Harp  44;  Pl. Grg. 455E;  Judeich  ( 1931)  155\u00ad60).  The  Long  Walls  and  the walls  of  Peiraieus  were  demolished  in  404  (Xen.  Hell. 2.2.20, 23),  but  rebuilt,  in  ashlar  masonry  (Garland  ( 1987)  165\u00ad67), in  the  years  395/4\u00ad392/1  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.9\u00ad10;  IG ii\u00b2  1656\u00ad64) and  repaired  in  the  years  after  338/7  (IG ii\u00b2  244;  Maier  ( 1961) nos. 1\u00ad10).  For  a  preserved  section  of  the  Long  Walls,  see AAA 5  ( 1972)  339\u00ad46.  The  Acropolis  was  besieged  by  the Athenians  opposing  Kylon  c. 636  (Thuc. 1.126.9),  by  the Lakedaimonians  and  the  Athenians  opposing  Hippias  in  510 (Hdt. 5.64.2),  by the  Athenians  opposing  Isagoras  in  508 (Hdt. 5.72.2),  and  by  the  Persians  in  480  (Hdt. 8.52).  Athens with  Peiraieus  was  besieged  by  the  Lakedaimonians  and their  allies  in  405/4  (Xen.  Hell. 2.2.4,  10\u00ad20). Most  of  the  buildings  serving  the  major  Athenian  polit- ical  institutions  have  been  located,  and  of  several,  substan- tial  remains  are  still  visible.  The  prytaneion  lay  somewhere north-east  of  the  Acropolis  (Plut.  Sol. 19.4,  quoting  a Solonian  law  of  C 6e;  SEG 33  115  (C 3m);  Dontas  ( 1983) 60\u00ad62).  The  bouleuterion  has  been  found  on  the  west  side  of the  agora  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 48.1;  Wycherley  ( 1957)  128\u00ad37; Thompson  and  Wycherley  ( 1972)  29\u00ad38).  The  \"Old Bouleuterion\"of  c. 500  (Shear  ( 1995);  contra  Miller ( 1995)) was  from  c. 400  used  as  a  Metroon  and  housed  the  public archives  (Dem. 19.129;  Sickinger  ( 1999))  and  was  replaced  by the  new  bouleuterion  (Thompson  and  Wycherley  ( 1972) 31\u00ad34).South  of  the  bouleuterion  was  a  building  called  tholos (Andoc. 1.45)  or  prytanikon  (Agora xv  89.40  (C 3m))  where the  fifty prytaneis  resided  (Wycherley  ( 1957)  179\u00ad84; Thompson  and  Wycherley  ( 1972)  41\u00ad46).  In front  of  this complex  lay  the  monument  of  the  ten  eponymous  heroes where  bills  and  some  public  enactments  were  set  up  (Isae. 5.38;  Wycherley  ( 1957)  85\u00ad90;  Thompson  and  Wycherley ( 1972)  41\u00ad46). Athens  was  one  of  the  few  poleis  that  had  a  separate  meet- ing-place  of  the  popular  assembly.  Since  c. 500  or  perhaps c. 460  it  was  placed  on  the  hill  of  the  Pnyx  (Pnyx  I),  and  it  was twice  reconstructed:  c. 400  (Pnyx  II)  and  again  in  the  330s (Pnyx  III)  (Thompson  ( 1982);  Hansen  ( 1989)  129\u00ad65;  Fors\u00e9n and  Stanton  ( 1996)). No  remains  have  been  found  of  the  homicide  courts (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 57.3).  The  most  important  was  the Areopagos,  meeting  on  the  Hill  of  Ares  (Dem. 23.65\u00ad66),the Palladion,  presumably  in  Phaleron  (schol.  Aeschin. 2.87), the  Delphinion  near  the  Olympieion  (Paus. 1.19.1),  and  a court  en  Phreatto  near  the  Zea  harbour  in  Peiraieus (Boegehold  ( 1995)  43\u00ad50).The  People's  Court  had  its  princi- pal  rooms  in  the  agora  (Ant. 5.10\u00ad11;Lys.19.55).In  the  north- east  corner  of  the  agora  beneath  the  stoa  of  Attalos  have been  found  the  foundations  of  a  large  square  peristyle  of c. 300,  and  beneath  that  the  foundations  of  five buildings (A\u00adE).  Building  A  of  C 5l  had  a  floor area of 900  m \u00b2  and  may have  been  the  so-called  Heliaia  (Dem. 47.12),  i.e.  the  Heliaia of  the  Thesmothetai  (IG i\u00b3  75.6)  (Hansen  ( 1989)  232\u00ad37; Boegehold  ( 1995)  11\u00ad15).  In  the  Lykourgan  period  there  was a  central  law  court  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 63.2),  probably  a  pre- decessor  of  the  square  peristyle  (Boegehold  ( 1995)  15\u00ad16, 108\u00ad13).  Other  public  buildings  used  as  court-rooms  were the  Stoa  Poikile  (IG ii\u00b2  1641B.38\u00ad40  (C 4m))  and  the Periklean  Odeion  (Dem. 59.52),  which  is  in  fact  the  only known  building  large  enough  to  accommodate  the  occa- sional  panels  of 2,000  or  even  2,500  dikastai  (Lys. 13.35;  Din. 1.52).  Associated  with  the  lawcourts  was  the  prison  (desmo- terion)  (Pl.  Phd. 59D;  Hunter  ( 1997)),  perhaps  to  be  ident- ified w ith  a  building  of  C 5m  in  the  south-west  corner  of  the 634 hansen agora  (Camp  ( 1986)  113\u00ad16).  Some  of  the  offices serving (boards  of)  magistrates  are  known  from  written  sources (Wycherley  ( 1957)  20\u00ad25,  126\u00ad84)  and/or  from  archaeologi- cal  evidence  (Camp  ( 1986)  100\u00ad35),  viz.  the  Stoa  Basileios (Dem. 25.23),  the  Thesmotheteion  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 3.5),  the Strategion  (Dem. 42.14),  the  Poleterion  (Dem. 25.57)  and  the Argyrokopion  (IG i\u00b3  1453.5,  8,  11). Apart  from  the  walls  and  the  purely  political  architecture, Athens  had  an  abundance  of  monumental  buildings  erected by  the  polis,  including  temples  and  shrines  and  elaborate edifices serving the navy.  In  this  context  it  suffices t o  single out  three  peaks  of  building  activity:  the  first under Peisistratos  and  his  sons  in  C 6s,the  second  under  Perikles  in C 5s,  and  the  third  under  Lykourgos  in  C 4s. ( 1)  On  the  Acropolis  the  Peisistratids'  principal  activity was  the  renovation  of  the  temple  of  Athena  Polias  (Boersma ( 1970)  no. 48);  in  the  agora  they  were responsible  for  the altar  of  the  Twelve  Gods  (Thuc. 6.54.6\u00ad7;Gadbery ( 1992)), the  enneakrounos  which  was  the  most  famous  fountain  of Athens  (Thuc. 2.15.5;  Boersma  ( 1970)no.  100)  and,  on  the west  side,  a  trapezoidal  building  with  a  columned  courtyard (Building  F,  Boersma  ( 1970)no.  144),  believed  by  some  to have  served  the  Solonian  boule  (Rhodes  ( 1972)  18\u00ad19),  by others  to  have  housed  the  Peisistratid  family  (Camp  ( 1986) 45).East  of  the  Acropolis  they  laid  the  foundations  of  a  giant dipteral  temple  for  Zeus  Olympios  (Arist.  Pol. 1313b23; Boersma  ( 1970)no.  70). ( 2)  The  monuments  invariably  associated  with  Perikles are  the  temples  on  the  Acropolis  (Thuc. 2.13.3;  Lycurg.  fr. 58; Hurwit  ( 1999)  154\u00ad221,313\u00ad18):the  Parthenon  ( 447\u00ad432),the Propylaia  ( 437\u00ad432)  and,  after  his  death,  the  temple  of Athena  Nike ( 427\u00ad422)  and  the  Erechtheion  ( 421\u00ad407). Furthermore,  the  Odeion  south  of  the  Acropolis  (c. 440\u00ad430; Hurwit  ( 1999)  216\u00ad17,317),and  the  Hephaisteion,  west  of  the agora  ( 450\u00ad440?:  Boersma  ( 1970)  59\u00ad61,no.  58).  The  most expensive  single  item  of  Perikles'  building  programme, however,  was  the  construction  of  ship  sheds  for  the  triremes in  Peiraieus  (neosoikoi:Dem. 22.76),  which  presumably  cost 1,000  tal.  but  were  demolished  under  the  Thirty  in  404/3 (Isoc. 7.66). ( 3)  A  building  programme  begun  under  Euboulos  was interrupted  by  the  war  against  Makedon,  but  resumed  and finished under L ykourgos  during  the  twelve  years  he  was  in charge  of  the  Athenian  finances (Hintzen-Bohlen ( 1997)). The  programme  is  attested  in  a  posthumous  honorary decree  for  Lykourgos  of 307/6  which  singles  out,  in  the Peiraieus,  the  completion  of  altogether  372  ship  sheds, neosoikoi  (IG ii\u00b2  1627.398\u00ad405)  and  the  Arsenal,  skeuotheke (IG ii\u00b2  1668  ( 347/6));  in  Athens,  the  erection  of  a Panathenaic  stadion,  the  furnishing  of  the  theatre  of Dionysos  with  a  grand  auditorium  (koilon)  in  marble,  the gymnasium  at  the  Lykeion  (IG ii\u00b2  457.5\u00ad9;Plut.  Mor. 852C), and,  we  can  add,  the  rebuilding  and  extension  of  the  assem- bly  place  on  the  Pnyx  (  Pnyx  III,  supra). C. 600  the  agora  was  moved  to  its  later  place,  and  c. 500  it was  marked  with  horoi  (IG i\u00b3  1087\u00ad89;  Camp  ( 1986)  38).  In addition  to  sanctuaries  and  buildings  serving  the  Council and  the  courts,  the  agora  was  adorned  with  a  number  of stoas:  the  Stoa  Basileios  from  perhaps  C 6m  (Lang  ( 1996) 152\u00ad53),  the  Stoa  Poikile  from  C 5f  (Camp  ( 1986)  68\u00ad72),  the Stoa  of  Zeus  Eleutherios  from  c. 430\u00ad420  (Camp  ( 1986) 105\u00ad7),  and  the  South  Stoa  from  c. 430\u00ad420  (Camp  ( 1986) 122\u00ad28).  Finally,  the  large  square  building  formerly  called the  Heliaia  was  probably  a  shrine  of  Aiax  and  in  C 4f  was used  as  storeroom  for  large  quantities  of  imported  grain (Stroud  ( 1998)  85\u00ad108). In  Athens  and  Peiraieus  there  were  at  least  three  theatres: the  famous  theatre of  Dionysos  on  the  south  slope  of  the Acropolis  (IG ii\u00b2  410.39  ( 335/4);  Pickard-Cambridge ( 1946)),  an  unlocated  theatre  known  exclusively  from  a  C 4s account  of  leases  (Agora xix  L 6.147\u00ad48),  and  the  theatre  in Mounichia  (Lys. 13.32;  McDonald  ( 1943)  51\u00ad54;  Garland ( 1987)  161). In  addition  to  private  gymnasia  (Xen.  Ath.  Pol. 2.10), Athens  had  three  major  public  gymnasia  (Dem. 24.114;Hyp. 1.26.22\u00ad4),  all  placed  outside  the  walls  in  the  suburbs  of Athens  (Kyle  ( 1987)  71\u00ad92):  Akademeia  (IG i\u00b3  1091;Harp. 56),  where  Plato  had  his  school  (Diog.  Laert. 3.5\u00ad7), Lykeion  (IG ii\u00b2  457B.7\u00ad8  ( 307/6);  Harp. 30) where Aristotle  taught  (Diog.  Laert. 5.2,  10)  recently  found  in  the excavations  of  Odos  Rigilles  (AR  ( 2001\u00ad2)  8),  and Kynosarges  (IG i\u00b3  134;Plut.  Them. 1.3)  frequented  by Antisthenes  (Diog.  Laert. 6.13).  There  was  no  monumental stadion  in  Athens  until  Lykourgos  had  one  built  near  the river  Ilissos  for  the  Great  Panathenaia  of 330  (IG ii\u00b2  351.16\u00ad20 ( 330/29);  Plut.  Mor. 841D;  Kyle  ( 1987)  92\u00ad95).  There  was  also a  hippodrome  (Dem. 47.53;Xen.  Hipparch. 3.14)  which  lay outside  the  city  near  Echelidai  (Etym.  Magn. 340.53)  and  was not  necessarily  a  monumental  building  (Kyle  ( 1987)  95\u00ad97). Very  little  is  known  about  the  residential  quarters  of Athens  in  the  Classical  period  (Hoepfner  ( 1999)  239\u00ad45), and  the  best  evidence  is  still  part  of  an  industrial  quarter between  the  agora  and  the  Pnyx,  excavated  in  the  1950s (Thompson  and  Wycherley  ( 1972)  173\u00ad82). The  inhabitants  of  Athens  were  buried  outside  the  walls. Graves  lined  all  the  major  roads,  and  several  large  cemeteries attika  635 were  placed  along  the  northern  part  of  the  walls  stretching from  the  Sacred  Gate  in  the  north-west  to  the  Diocharian Gate  in  the  north-east  (Kurtz  and  Boardman  ( 1971)  91\u00ad96). From C 6  onwards  the  main  cemetery  was  at  Kerameikos (Knigge  ( 1988)). In  the  Archaic  period,  the  Athenian  harbour  was  at Phaleron  (Hdt. 6.116).  In  the  Classical  period,  Athens  had three  harbours,  all  in  Peiraieus  (Ps.-Skylax  57):  two  smaller ones,  Zea  (SEG 19  80.10  (C 3s))  and  Mounichia  (SEG 41  13 (C 5f)),  both  east  of  the  Akte  peninsula,  and  a  larger  one, Kantharos  (schol.  Ar.  Pax 145),west  of  the  peninsula  (map  in Travlos  ( 1988)  347).Zea,Mounichia  and  the  southern  side  of Kantharos  were  military  harbours  (IG ii\u00b2  1627.401\u00ad5 ( 330/29)).  The  commercial  harbour,  the  emporion,(SEG 26 72.21;  IG i\u00b3  1101.A\u00adB  (C 5m))  stretched  along  the  eastern  and northern  sides  of  Kantharos  (Garland  ( 1987)  83\u00ad95).  The emporion  was  reserved  for  overseas  commerce  (Dem. 34.26\u00ad28,  42\u00ad44;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 51.4;  Gauthier  ( 1981)  7\u00ad13). The  emporion  included  five large pillared halls (schol.  Ar. Pax 145).  The  Great  Stoa,  or  Barley  Hall,  was  the  storage place  for  imported  grain  (schol.  Ar.  Ach. 548).  The  second, called  Deigma,  was  a  market-hall  for  merchants  and  bankers (Xen.  Hell. 5.1.21).  The  urban  centre  of  Peiraieus  was  laid  out by  Hippodamos  of  Miletos  in  C 5f  (Arist.  Pol. 1267b22\u00ad23). The  residential  area  was  laid  out  on  a  grid  plan  with  insulae subdivided  into  plots  of  equal  size,  on  which  were  built roughly  similar  terrace  houses  (Hoepfner  and  Schwandner ( 1994)  22\u00ad50). Only  a  very  rough  guesstimate  can  give  us  an  idea  of  the size  of  the  urban  population.  The  walls  of  Athens  and Peiraieus  enclosed  altogether 600  ha  (Athens: 211  ha, Peiraieus: 300  ha;  the  space  between  the  Long  Walls: 100  ha).  The  space  between  the  Long  Walls  was  probably uninhabited  except  during  the  Peloponnesian  War  (Thuc. 2.17.3).  If  we  assume  that  half  of  the  remaining 500  ha  were inhabited,  and  that  the  population  density  was 250  persons per  ha  (Jameson  et  al.( 1994)  549\u00ad51),  the  result  is  an  urban population  of  c. 62,500  persons  to  which  must  be  added  the population  of  the  suburbs  (Isoc. 16.13).  Now,  tombstones and  bouleutic  quotas  indicate  that  in  C 4  c. 7.5\u00ad9  per  cent  of the  citizens  belonged  to  the  six  urban  demes  (Hansen  et  al. ( 1990)  32\u00ad35).  Let  us  assume  that  they  lived  in  the  urban area;  that,  say,  twice  as  many  had  migrated  from  Attika  into Athens  (Hansen  ( 1989)  87\u00ad90);  and  that  the  number  of metics  and  slaves  living  in  Athens-Peiraieus  equalled  the number  of  citizens.  The  result  is  an  urban  population  of between 47,000  and 56,000  personsintheageof Demosthenes. (E)  Athens  had  its  own  mint  from  c. 550.  The  first series of coins,  the  so-called  Wappenm\u00fcnzen,  may have been  struck from  silver  imported  from  Thrace  (Kraay  ( 1962)  33);  the  sil- ver  used  for  the  so-called  owls  came  from  the  Laureion mines  (Ar.  Av. 1106:    ).  ( 1)  Silver coins  on  the  Euboic  standard  c. 550\u00ad525,  the  so-called Wappenm\u00fcnzen.  Denominations:  mostly  didrachm,  but  in the  later  phase  also  tetradrachm,  drachm  and  obol.  Types: obv.  a  great  variety  of  types  including  triskeles,  amphora, owl,  wheel,  Gorgoneion,  etc.;  rev.  incuse  square,  sometimes diagonally  quartered  and  sometimes  with  head  of  panther. ( 2)  Silver  coins  on  the  Attic  standard  c. 520  onwards,  the  so- called  owls.  Denominations:  decadrachm  (only  in  C 5f), tetradrachm,  didrachm,  drachm,  triobol,  diobol,  obol  and (in  C 4)  fractions  down  to  hemitartemorion.  Types:  obv. head  of  Athena  in  helmet  adorned  with  three  olive  leaves; rev.  owl  in  incuse  square  with  olive  branch  in  top  left  corner. Legend: .  The  minting  of  silver  coins  was  interrupted during  the  Decelean  War  and  resumed  not  later  than  c. 393 (Ar.  Eccl. 819).During  this  period  the  Athenians  struck  coins of  gold  and  bronze  with  similar  types,  the  gold  coins  proba- bly  in  407/6,  the  bronze  coins  down to 393.  The  minting  of silver  coins  was  resumed  in  C 4e,  and  the  C 5  types  were used with  small  stylistic  changes,  the  most  important  being  that Athena's  full  face  eye  was  replaced  by  a  profile r epresenta- tion.  ( 3)  In  C 4s  the  small  fractions  were  replaced  by  bronze coins  with  similar  types  (Starr  ( 1970);  Kraay  ( 1976)  55\u00ad77; Kroll  and  Walker  ( 1993);  SNG  Cop.  Attica 1\u00ad82).  In  C 5\u00adC4 imitations  of  Athenian  silver  coins  were  struck  in  Egypt,  in Phoenicia,  in  Asia  Minor  and  in  India  (M\u00f8rkholm  ( 1974); Kraay  ( 1976)  73\u00ad74,  76\u00ad77,  292\u00ad93;Buttrey ( 1982);  SNG  Cop. Attica 105\u00ad10;  Suppl. 1244\u00ad45).  Athenian  coins  and  imita- tions  in  great  numbers  have  been  found  in  Sicily,  in  Egypt, along  the  Syrian  coast,  and  in  southern  Asia  Minor.  None has  been  found  in  the  Pontic  region  and  in  the  Propontis, and  very  few  in  Thrace  and  along  the  west  coast  of  Asia Minor  (Isager  and  Hansen  ( 1975)  46\u00ad49,  215\u00ad17,  222). That  Athens  did  not  take  part  in  the  Archaic  colonisation is  a  widespread  but  seriously  misleading  belief.  In  the Archaic  period  Athens  colonised  Sigeion  (no. 791)  (C 7l); Elaious  (no. 663)  (C 7l  and  C 6m);  Chersonesos  (no. 661) (C 6m);  Paktye  (no. 671)  (C 6m);  Sestos  (no. 672)  (C 6m); Kardia  (no. 665)  (C 6m);  Lemnos  (nos. 502\u00ad3)  (c. 500); Imbros  (no. 483)  (c. 500),  and  sent  klerouchs  (?)  to  Chalkis (no. 365)  ( 506\u00adC5e).In  C 5Athens  sent  colonists  and/or  kler- ouchs  to Skyros  (no. 521)  ( 476/5);  Eion  (no. 630)  ( 476); Neapolis  (no. 677)  (C 5?);  Neapolis  (no. 63)  (C 5m);  Andros (no. 475)  (C 5m);  Sybaris  3  (no. 70)  ( 446/5);  Thourioi  (no. 74) 636 hansen ( 444/3);  Brea  (no. 624)  (c. 445);  Chersonesos  (no. 661) (C 5m);  Histiaia  (no. 372)  ( 446\u00ad404?);  Karystos  (no. 373) (C 5m);  Amphipolis  (no. 553)  ( 437/6);  Astakos  (no. 737) ( 435/4);  Amisos  (no. 712)  ( 430s);  Sinope  (no. 729)  ( 430s); Aigina  (no. 358)  ( 431\u00ad405);  Naxos  (no. 507)  (C 5m);  Poteidaia (no. 598)  ( 430\u00ad404?);  Kolophon  (no. 848)  ( 427);  Antissa  (no. 794)  ( 427);  Eresos  (no. 796)  ( 427);  Mytilene  (no. 798) ( 427);  Pyrrha  (no. 799)  ( 427);  Skione  (no. 609)  ( 421);  Melos (no. 505)  ( 415);  Miletouteichos  (no. 751)  (c. 410);  Plakia  (no. 757)  (?);  Skylake  (no. 761)  (?).  In  C 4  Athens  sent colonists  and/or  klerouchs  to  Poteidaia  (no. 598)  ( 362/1); Chersonesos  (no. 661)  (C 4f);  Elaious  (no. 663)  ( 353\u00ad43); Sestos  (no. 672)  ( 353/2);  Samos  (no. 865)  ( 365\u00ad22);  naustath- mon  in  the  Adriatic  (IG ii\u00b2  1629.165\u00ad272)  ( 425/4). 362. ", "Eleusis": "Identifier: 363. , Map 59.  Lat. 38.05,long.  23.35.  Size  of  territo- ry: 1  or 2.  Type:  B.  The  toponym  is  ',-  ,  (Arist. Ath.  Pol. 39.1;Xen.  Hell. 2.4.43;Diod.  14.35.6).  No  city-ethnic is  attested,  but  the  official name of  the  polity  seems  to  have been       '   (Arist.  Ath. Pol. 39.2,  5,  40.4).  There  is  no  reason  to  assume  that  Eleusis was  a  polis  in  the  early  Archaic  period,  but  in  the  years 403\u00ad401  it  was  a  self-governing  polity  settled  with  the  core  of the  oligarchic  faction  in  the  civil  war  404/3.  It  is  not  called  a polis  in  any  source,  but  it  seems  to  have  had  the  same  status as  a  klerouchy.  The  Eleusinians  remained  Athenian  citizens and  are  described  as  epitimoi  and  Athenaioi.  The  official name  of  the  polity  seems  to  have  been     '   (supra),  just  as  the  C 4  klerouchs in  Poteidaia  were  called         (Dem. 7.10).  Like  klerouchs,  they  could return  to  Athens  and  reactivate  their  full  Athenian  citizen- ship.  Considering  the  full  self-government  enjoyed  by  the community,  Eleusis  in  403\u00ad401  must  be  included  in  this inventory  as  a  polis  type B. During  the  oligarchic  regime  in  404/3,  the  Thirty  wanted to  secure  Eleusis  for  themselves  as  a  possible  refuge  and  had many  of  the  Eleusinians  executed  (Xen.  Hell. 2.4.8\u00ad10).  In connection  with  the  restoration  of  the  democracy  in  403,it was  decided  that  those  of  the  oligarchs  from  Athens  who  so wished  could  leave  Athens  and  have  Eleusis  as  their  resid- ence  alongside  those  of  the  Eleusinians  whom  they  wanted to  retain.  Thus,  the  new  polis  was  created  by  a  synoecism  of oligarchs  from  both  communities  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 39.3: ).  The  oligarchs  in  Eleusis  were  banned  from Athens,  and  the  democrats  in  Athens  from  Eleusis.  The Eleusinian  oligarchs  were  still  Athenian  citizens  ( \u00b5), but  self-governing  (            \u00b5).  They  were  explicitly banned  from  holding  office in A thens,  unless  they  left Eleusis  and  registered  as  ordinary  Athenian  citizens  once again.  Eleusis  was  to  be  a  member  of  the  Peloponnesian League  like  Athens,  and  the  Eleusinians  and  Athenians  were to  share  the  Eleusinian  sanctuary  and  the  mysteries  (Arist. Ath.  Pol. 39.1\u00ad5;Diod.  14.35.6;  Cloch\u00e9  ( 1915)  256\u00ad59,  278\u00ad95; Loening  ( 1987)). Soon  afterwards  it  was  reported  to  Athens  that  the  oli- garchs  in  Eleusis  had  begun  to  hire  mercenaries  (Xen.  Hell. 2.4.43),  and,  according  to  a  late  source  (Just.  Epit. 5.10.8\u00ad11), they  even  attacked  Athens.  In 401/0  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 40.4)  the Athenians  marched  out  in  full  force  (Xen.  Hell. 2.4.43)  and laid  siege  to  Eleusis  (Lys. 25.9).  Some  of  the  oligarchs  desert- ed  and  joined  the  Athenian  democrats  (ibid.).  During  a meeting  between  the  two  sides,  the  Athenians  killed  the Eleusinian  strategoi  and  persuaded  the  Eleusinians  to  give up  Eleusis  and  move  back  to  Athens,  where  a  new  amnesty was  declared  (Xen.  Hell. 2.4.43;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 40.4). The  bronze  coins  struck  in  C 4\u00adC3  and  inscribed   were  for  the  requirements  of  the  Eleusinian  festivals  and  have no  relation  to  the  oligarchic  polis  of 403\u00ad401.

The  legend  is  probably  an abbreviated  form  not  of  the  ethnic  () but of the  ktetikon (),  and  the  coin  inscribed reveals  that  such  coins  were  struck  by  the  Athenian mint  for  the  festival  of  the  Mysteries,  not  by  the  Eleusinians (Kroll  and  Walker  ( 1993)  26\u00ad28). 363.

Thouria  would  have  been  detached  from  Sparta  either  in  338 or,  perhaps  more  likely,  in  369,  and  under  the  probably  fed- eral  arrangements  that  followed  the  foundation  of  Messene (supra)  we  find the phrase        applied to  a  citizen  of  the  polis  (BCH 6  ( 1882)  221  no. 53  F.Delphes iii.45  ( 315\u00ad280)).  The  feminine  (IG ii\u00b2  8895  (C 4m)) may  refer  to  this  or  another,  similarly  named  polis. Thouria  was  the  only  perioikic  polity  apart  from  Aithaia (no. 312)  to  revolt  in  465  (Thuc. 1.101.2).  It  is  not  explicitly called  a  polis,however,before IvO 46  (a  C 2m  boundary  adju- dication  with  Megalopolis  (no. 282)),  where  it  is  called  polis in  the  political  sense.  But  it  was  probably  a  polis  long  before: Thuc. 1.101.2  uses  the  external  collective  city-ethnic,  and  if  it refers  to the  present  city,  IG ii\u00b2  8895  (C 4m)  attests  the  exter- nal  individual  use.  Finally,  a  citizen  of  Thouria  was  granted proxeny  at  Delphi  (no. 177)  c. 316  (BCH 6  ( 1882),  221  no. 53; F.Delphes iii.45). The  site  of  Thouria  is  probably  MME  no. 137,  Ellinika Aithaias,  not  far  north  of  modern  Thouria  (Aithaia  is  the  for- mer  Delimimi, no. 304;  the  latter  was  formerly Phroutzalokamara, no. 1237).  From  Ellinika  come Bronze  Age  and  Protogeometric  to  Roman  finds;  the  extent  of the  historical  site  is  not  stated  in  the  literature  (cf.  McDonald and  Rapp  ( 1972)  243).  See  Lazenby  ( 1972)  86  and  Hope Simpson  ( 1972)  98  n. 94  for  more  details;  Valmin  ( 1930)  51, 56\u00ad61;Meyer  in  KlPauly  v. 801\u00ad2,s.v.Thuria;Meyer  ( 1978)  182. The  late  Classical  or  Hellenistic  fortifications at Ellinika are C 4l\u00adC3e  (Hope  Simpson  ( 1972)  98  n. 111,(1966)  123\u00ad24;illus- trated,  MME  pl. 9.4).  Paus. 4.31.2  says  that  the  city  was  for- merly  on  higher  ground,  where  he  saw  ruined  walls  and  a sanctuary  of  the  Syrian  goddess;  while  the  sanctuary  would have  been  Hellenistic,  the  walls  may  have  been  Classical. Paus. 4.31.1  includes  Thouria  in  his  account  of  Messenia. Strabo  8.4.4  implies  that  it  is  a  polis  with  a  territory.  It  was probably  detached  from  Sparta  (no. 345)  in  338/7  rather  than 369,  since  Sparta  seems  to  have  retained  the  land  around  the head  of  the  Messenian  (or  Thouriate)  Gulf  (Shipley  ( 2000) 385).  In  the  early  Hellenistic  period,  Stephanus  Comicus, Philolakon,fr. 1  apud  Athen. 469  a\u00adb  ( \u00b5 \u00b5      ) implies that at least one subordi- nate  centre  existed  in  this  district  in  the  time  of  King Pyrrhos. Various  public  institutions  and  officials are named in inscriptions,  but  only  in  the  Hellenistic  period:  e.g.  IG v.1 1379  (C 2\u00adC1),  1380  (C 2),  1384  (C 2l),  1386  (c.C 2),  1388  (undat- ed).  They  imply  a  democratic  constitution  at  that  time, which  may  have  existed  since  369  or 338. In c.C 4e  a  festival  of  Poseidon,  the  h,  was  held  at Thouria  (IG v.1213).", "Kardamyle": "Identifier: 317. , (Skardamylites) Map  58.  Lat. 36.50,long. 22.15.  Size  of  territory: 1.  Type:  C.  (S 34).  The  toponym  is \u00b5, (Hom.  Il. 9.150  9.252;  Hdt. 8.73.2; Strabo  8.4.1,  etc.;  Paus. 3.26.7).  The  city-ethnic  may  be \u00b5  (Hdn. iii.2  530.22;  Steph.  Byz. 357.17;  these could  refer  to  Kardamyle  in  Chios  (no. 840;  Thuc. 8.24.3), but  that  was  not  a  polis).  Both  late  authors  state  that  the locals  used  the  form  \u00b5. Strabo  8.4.4  locates  Kardamyle  \"on  a  deserted  rock\" between  Leuktron  and  Pharai  (no. 320),  which  does  not mean  that  it  had  been  abandoned.  Paus. 3.26.7  locates  it  60 stades  ( 11  km)  after  Leuktra  (overestimating  by  a  factor  of two;  Valmin  ( 1930)  199)  and  an  unspecified distance before Gerenia.  It  is  generally  identified w ith  MME  no. 147,  Kastro Kardamylis  (Archaic  to  mediaeval  remains,  as  well  as  pre- historic).  Hope  Simpson  ( 1972)  98  n. 100  notes  that  early Doric  columns  have  been  found  (citing  ArchDelt 22  ( 1967) B. 1206;  see  also  ArchDelt 20  ( 1965)  B  208). Kardamyle  is  not  called  a  polis  in  Classical  sources,  but Hdt. 8.73.2  identifies M essenian  Asine  (no. 313),  which  he describes  as  a  polis,  as  \"the  Asine  by  (or  opposite)  the Laconian  Kardamyle  ( \u00b5    )\",  possi- bly  implying  that  Kardamyle  was  at  least  as  prominent  a place  as  Asine,  and  so  possibly  a  polis.  It  is  called  a  polisma  by Paus. 3.26.7.  Herodotos'  description  of  Kardamyle  as \"Laconian\"  ( )  implicitly  places  it  in  Lakonike, the  territory  of  Sparta  (no. 345).  Steph.  Byz. 357.17,  while  cit- ing  Herodotos,  places  it  in  Messenia,  perhaps  reflecting the changed  circumstances  of  the  Roman  period  (though  the words    are  restored  from  the  parallel  pas- sage  in  Eust.  Il. 743.17). Kardamyle  is  one  of  Agamemnon's  seven  ptoliethra (Hom.  Il. 9.150  9.292).  It is  generally  thought  to have been a  perioikic  polis  during  Spartan  rule  over  Messenia  (e.g. Roebuck  ( 1941)  30\u00ad31  n. 17).  Though  situated  between  two Eleutherolaconian  poleis,  Leuktra  and  Gerenia,  it  did  not join  that  League  when  it  was  founded  under  Augustus,  being instead  detached  from  Messenia  and  given  to  Sparta  (Paus. 3.26.7).  Since  the  Eleutherolaconian  league  was  largely  a refoundation  of  the  koinon  of  the  Lakedaimonians  that  was 560 shipley set  up  after  after  the  Roman  take-over  in  195,Kardamyle  had probably  not  been  a  member  of  that  body  either,  which probably  means  that  it  ceased  to  be  perioikic  in  338,  when Philip  II  detached  southern  Messenia  and  the  Dentheliatis from  Sparta  (Shipley  ( 2000)  385\u00ad86). 316.

Byz. 378.1;Strabo 8.4.5;  Paus. 4.34.4)  or  (IG v.134  SEG 11  479 (second  century  ad)).  Strabo  8.4.5  cites  the  view  that  it  was Homer's  Pedasos;  Paus. 4.34.5  states  that  its  original  name was  Aipeia.  The  city-ethnic  is  but occurs first on C 2m  coins  of  the  Achaian  Confederacy  inscribed   (Head,  HN \u00b2433);  cf.  SEG 11  985  (second  cen- tury  ad),  a  decree  of  the  polis.  On  Korone's  location,  see Hope  Simpson  ( 1972)  97\u00ad98  n. 91;Roebuck ( 1941)  19\u00ad22; Valmin  ( 1930)  171\u00ad80,(1934\u00ad35)  44\u00ad46;Meyer ( 1978)  195\u00ad96. Korone  is  called  a  polis  only  by  late  sources  such  as  Strabo 8.4.5,  Paus. 4.34.4,  SEG 11  985  (second  century  ad),  and Steph.  Byz. 378.1.  However,  if  Korone  is  correctly  identified with  MME  no. 502,  Petalidhi  (rather  than  mediaeval  Coron, modern  Koroni,  which  is  identified w ith  ancient  Asine),  the archaeological  evidence  suggests  the  possibility  that  it  was  a Classical  polis.  The  main  evidence  is  the  supposed  date  of  the substantial  city  walls,  which  Valmin  ( 1930)  178  regards  as including  renovations  from  Epameinondas'  time. At 4.34.5,  Pausanias  says  that  it  was  originally  called Aipeia,  but  was  renamed  Koroneia  by  its  Theban  oecist, Epimelides  (for  whom  there  was  a  hero  shrine  at  Korone, 4.34.6),after  the  liberation  of  Messenia;  the  name  was  short- ened  to  Korone  by  the  Messenians  ( is  actually found  in  inscriptions  of  Roman  date  from  Sparta  (supra)). This  suggests  a  refoundation  c. 369;  however,  Lazenby  ( 1972) 89  and  Hope  Simpson  ( 1972)  99  n. 125  suggest  that  Korone (and  Kolonides)  were  founded  in  the  aftermath  of 369  to  iso- late  perioikic  Asine  (no. 313)  and  Mothone  (no. 319). Under  Spartan  rule,  the  surrounding  area  was  one  of  the most  densely  settled  in  Messenia  (Harrison  and  Spencer ( 1998)  159).  The  important  Classical  sanctuary  of  Apollo Korythos  (Paus. 4.34.7)  probably  lay  in  Korone's territory. Votives  there  include  SEG 42  342,  40  362  (c. 460?),  a  bronze spear-butt  dedicated  by  the  Messenians,  possibly  celebrat- ing  a  victory  over  the  Spartans  during  the  revolt  of  the  460s (cf.  Bauslaugh  ( 1990);  LSAG  Messenia  no. 3  (c.C 5e?)).  Other early  votives  include  SEG 11  993  (c. 500).  Full  refs.  in  Meyer ( 1978)  196\u00ad97.  Paus. 4.34.4  locates  Korone  20  stades  ( 3.7  km) from  an  inland  spring,  Plataniston,  which  supplied  the town.  At 4.34.6  he  notes  temples  of  Artemis  Paidotrophos, Dionysos  and  Asklepios,  as  well  as  a  hero  shrine  to Epimelides. 317.

The  (possible)  city-ethnic  is (Xen.  Hell. 3.3.8;  Steph.  Byz. 147.7). Paus. 4.36.7  places  Aulon  between  Kyparissos  (no. 317) and  the  river  Neda.  Valmin  ( 1930)  107\u00ad11  (and  Barr.)  locates it  at  MME  no. 601,  Vounaki  Palioneriou  (cf.  Roebuck  ( 1941) 25\u00ad26  n. 95;  for  the  name  Palioneri,  cf. no. 3124),a  for- tified site w ith  an  area  of 0.8  ha,  and  with  Hellenistic,  Roman and  possibly  Classical  finds.  Hope  Simpson  ( 1972)  94  and  n. 101,however,suggests  MME  no. 602,Ag.Ilias,a  Classical  and Hellenistic  site  of  at  least  3  ha  with  a  good  view  over  the coastal  route. Aulon  is  called  a  polis  only  by Steph.  Byz. 147.6,who  lists  it as  \"one  of  the  100  poleis\",  suggesting  a  Classical  or  Hellenistic source  such  as  Theopompos;  it  is  not  clear  whether  polis  is here  used  in  the  urban  or  the  political  sense.  It  is  not  certain, however,  that  Aulon  was  a  polis  in  the  Classical  period.  A possible  comparandum  is  Laconian  ,  whose  name may  be  a  sub-regional  ethnic  rather  than  a  city-ethnic. Roebuck  ( 1941)  25\u00ad26  n. 95  (followed  by  Hope  Simpson ( 1972)  98  n. 101)  takes  Aulon  in  Xen.  Hell. 3.2.25  (where  Agis invades  Elis  ' ,  \"via  Aulon\"  or  \"through  the aulon\")  to  be  a  district.  At  Hell. 3.3.10  Xenophon  uses  the preposition  with  the  dative  to  locate  men  previously sent  to Aulon  ( ' );  this,  again,  may  possibly  sug- gest  that  the  name  denotes  a  geographical  location  rather than  a  polis,  though  there  may  also  have  been  a  polis.At 3.3.8 Xenophon  says  (with  reference  to c. 399)  that  the  conspirator Kinadon  was  sent  to Aulon  to bring  back  \"certain  of  the Aulonitai\"  and  certain  helots;  Roebuck  (ibid.)  accepts  that this  passage  probably  refers  to  a  town.  It  is  implicitly  called an  oppidum  by  Plin.  HN 4.5.14,  who  lists  it  first among the westward  oppida  of  Elis. Aulon  may  well  have  been  a  perioikic  polis  during  the  peri- od  of  Spartan  rule  in  Messenia.  Kinadon,  the  conspirator  sent to  arrest  certain  Aulonitai,  is  described  by  Xen.  Hell. 3.3.5  as \"not  of  the  homoioi\"  (the  full-citizen  Spartiates),  while  at 3.3.11  he  is  reported  to  have  said  that  he  aspired  to  be  \"a  lesser man  ( ) than none in Lakedaimon\".  He  has  generally been  assumed  to have belonged  to the  class  of  \"inferiors\" ( \u00b5) attested only in the enumeration of  his  fellow- plotters  at  Xen.  Hell. 3.3.6.  As  a  demoted  Spartiate,  Kinadon could  still  have had  authority over  perioikoi.Roebuck ( 1941) 30  n. 13  and  Spencer  ( 1998)  176  assume  that  Aulon  was  perioi- kic.  If  perioikic,  the  population  of  Aulon  may  have  been  eth- nically  Messenian  or  Lakedaimonian,  depending  on  whether colonists  were  sent  by  Sparta. The  external  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  (if  it  is  one) occurs  at  Xen.  Hell. 3.3.8. No  name  is  given  to the  territory of  Aulon.  Given  its  pro- posed  location,  it  would  have  been  lost  by  Sparta  (no. 345)  in 369.It  was  probably  bounded  by the  territory of  Triphylia  on the  north.  Aulon  may  have  belonged  to  a  Messenian  koinon after  338/7  (cf.  Lazenby  ( 1972)  90). 315. ", "Mothone": "Identifier: 320. , (Mothonaios) Map  58.  Lat. 36.50,long. 21.40.

That  the  latter  is  correct  for  the Classical  and  at  least  the  early  Hellenistic  period  is  suggest- ed  by C 3  coins  with  the  legend  (Head,  HN \u00b2433; Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 3  no. 1035;  SNG  Cop.  Phliasia\u00adLaconia 537).  The  former  spelling  was  perhaps  an  assimilation  to Methone  (no. 541)  in  Makedonia,  just  as  Methana  (no. 352) in  the  Argolid  was  sometimes  misspelled  Methone  in  some MSS  of  Thucydides  (as  noted  by  Strabo  8.6.15  Theopomp. fr. 384).  The  city-ethnic  is  in  Paus. 4.18.1  and  on third  century  ad  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2433). Mothone  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Thuc. 2.25.2;  at  Ps.-Skylax  46,  where polis  is  used  in  the  urban sense,  Mothone  is  the  second  (or  first) t oponym  listed  after the  heading   . Mothone  is  located  in  Lakonike  by  Thuc. 2.25.1  (cf.  Diod. 11.84.6  (r 454)),  and  in  Lakedaimon  by  Ps.-Skylax  46. Mothone's territory ( ,Paus.4.35.6) would have been  bounded  by  those  of  Asine  (no. 313)  to  the  east,  Pylos  to the  north,  and  possibly  Korone  (no. 316)  to  the  north-east and  Kolonides  (if,  as  Lazenby  and  Hope  Simpson  ( 1972)  sug- gest,  it  was  founded  post- 369  to  isolate  Asine  and  Mothone). Mothone  is  assumed  to  have  been  perioikic  by  Harrison  and Spencer  ( 1998)  156;  this  seems  certain,  since  the  Athenians twice  thought  it  worth  attacking.  It  remained  perioikic  after 369,  being  listed  under  Lakedaimon  by  Ps.-Skylax  46.  It  was probably  dependent  upon  Messene  after  338,  perhaps  as  a member  of  a  Messenian  Federation  (see  under  Messene, supra). The  city  is  securely  located  at  MME  no. 412,  Methoni (Archaic  to  mediaeval  pottery,  graves,  architectural  fragments),  mediaeval  Modon  with  its  Venetian  fortress.

In  454,  it  was taken  by  Tolmides  (Diod. 11.84.6);  in  431  it  was  fortified,  but weak  and  unmanned  (Thuc. 2.25.1;  cf.  HCT  ad  loc.;  cf.  also Diod. 12.43.2\u00ad3,  which  mentions  an  unsuccessful  Athenian siege).  The  walls  and  harbour  mole  were  incorporated  into the  spectacular  Venetian  fortifications (Meyer ( 1978)  200). Pausanias  gives  Mothone  a  legendary  origin,  its  harbour having  been  built  by  King  Dotadas  ( 4.3.10),  and  its  name before  the  Trojan  War  having  been  Pedasos  (see  Hom.  Il. 9.152  9.294  and  supra 549,  553\u00ad54).  The  same  is  asserted  by Strabo  8.4.3,  who  notes  that  some  people  locate  Homer's Aipeia  here.  More  plausibly,  at  4.24.4  Pausanias  says  that Mothone  was  founded  by  exiles  from  Nauplia,  who  were  not expelled  after  Leuktra  ( 4.37.8). 320.

Pharai  was  clearly  a  polis  by 182,  when  it  joined  the Achaian  Confederacy  separately  from  Messene  (Polyb. 23.17.2);  but  earlier  references  are  vague  about  its  status.  Xen. Hell. 4.8.7  refers  to it  as  a  chora,  but  not  in  such  a  way  as  to exclude  a  polis,  and  it  was  clearly  already  a  settlement. Archaeological  evidence  suggests  that  it  was  a  significant settlement  from  early  times,  and  a  fortified polis  at  least post- 369.  It  is  plausibly  located  at  modern  Kalamata  (offi- cially  Kalamai),  specifically MME no. 142,  Kastro  Kalamatas (LH iii,  Geometric  to  mediaeval;  extent  not  stated; Hellenistic  foundations,  C 4(?)  city  walls,  Archaic  to  Roman funerary  reliefs).  The  Classical  fortifications appear t o  have occupied  a  much  smaller  area  than  those  of  the  Hellenistic period  (Hope  Simpson  ( 1972)  99  n. 124).  See  Meyer  ( 1978) 181  for  full  bibliography.  Ancient  authors  identified it w ith Pharai  or  Phere  ( ,  ),  home  of  Diokles  (a  descendant of  the  river  Alpheios:  Hom.  Il. 5.543,  Od. 3.488  15.186)  and one  of  Agamemnon's  seven  ptoliethra  (Il. 9.151  9.293;  cf. 2.743).  In  Pausanias,  it  has  a  legendary  oecist  ( 4.30.2)  and  is described  as  having  been  a  polis  during  the  Second Messenian  War  ( 4.16.8). To  the  west,  the  temple  of  Poseidon  at  Akovitika  will  have lain  within  the  territory of  Pharai;  finds there include C 6 and  C 5  votives  to  Pohoidan  (SEG 25  431),  tiles  with \u00b5  stamps  (SEG 25  432  (C 6\u00adC5)),  and  the  earliest Messenian  text,  a  C 6m(?)  relief  pithos  dedicated  to Poseidon  (LSAG \u00b2  addenda,  p. 448  no. 1a;  Themelis  ( 1969)  fig. 4,(1970)  figs  1\u00ad2,  pl. 37).  Cultic  rock-cut  inscriptions,  seem- ingly  Late  Archaic  or  Early  Classical,  are  found  about  an hour  away  (c. 6km?)and  include  votives  to  Kore,  Pan  and  the Tityroi(?)

Paus. 4.31.1  mentions  the grove  of  Apollo  Karneios;  if  correctly  identified w ith  MME no. 540,  1  km  east  of  Ag.  Pantes  near  Kalamata,  this  should date  back  to  Geometric  and  Archaic  times. After 369,  Pharai  may,  like  Mothone  (no. 319),  have  been dependent  on  Messene  within  a  loose  federal  structure  (cf. Lazenby  ( 1972)  90). 321.

Hell. 7.1.25;  Ps.-Skylax 46). Although  Xen.  Hell. 7.1.25  places  it  in  ,  the Messenian  town is  presumably  meant,  since  Lakaina  is probably  equivalent  to Lakonike,  the  territory controlled  by Sparta  (no. 345);  it  is  explicitly  distinguished  from  Laconian Asine  at  e.g.  Strabo  8.4.1  (     ) and Steph.  Byz. 131.11\u00ad13  ( ,  ...     ).  The  city-ethnic  is (Xen.  An. 5.3.4;  Hell. 7.1.25;  IG ii\u00b2  8387a  (C 4));  it  is specified as      [  ] in SEG  12 219  BCH 77  ( 1953)  166  (Delphi, 322\u00ad310). Paus. 4.34.12  locates  Asine  40  stades  ( 7.3  km)  from Kolonides  and  a  similar  distance  from  Cape  Akritas.  Hdt. 8.73.2  locates  it    \u00b5,  which  must  mean opposite  Kardamyle.  The  polis  is  usually  (so  Barr.)  located  at MME  no. 512,  Bourgo  Koronis  (mediaeval  Coron,  the  name having  migrated  hither),  possibly  legendary  Rhion  (see introduction  to  this  chapter).  Asine  was  sometimes  ident- ified w ith  Homer's  Antheia  (Strabo  8.4.5).Valmin  ( 1930)  169 suggests  that  Rhion  is  the  eastern  part  of  Cape  Akritas,  on the  western  side  of  the  Thouriate  Gulf,  rather  than  its  north- eastern  side.  For  a  summary  of  the  arguments  about  its  loca- tion,  see  Hope  Simpson  ( 1972)  97\u00ad98  n. 91  (citing  Roebuck ( 1941)  19\u00ad22;  contra  Valmin  ( 1930)  164\u00ad68,  169,(1934\u00ad35) 44\u00ad46).  The  earliest  find is an early A rchaic  Protocorinthian sherd  (cf.  Valmin  ( 1930)  178;  Hope  Simpson  ( 1957)  249).  Cf., however,  SEG 11  985  (second  century  ad),a  decree  of  Korone found  at  modern  Koroni,  which  the  editors  in  SEG  suspect may  cause  the  orthodox  view  to  be  revised,  though  Roebuck ( 1941)  19\u00ad22  presumes  that  the  stone  was  transported  from the  site  of  ancient  Korone  (no. 316)  at  Petalidi.  See  also Meyer  ( 1978)  198\u00ad99. Asine  is  implicitly  called  a  polis  in  Hdt. 8.73.2,  where polis is  used  in  the  urban  and/or  political  sense;  in  Ps.-Skylax  46, where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense,Asine  (presumably  the Messenian  one,  cf.  infra)  is  listed  as  the  first t oponym  after the  heading     (though  Mothone  (no. 319),  listed second,  ought  to  have  been  named  first).  Otherwise  it  is called  a  polis  only  in  post-Classical  sources:  e.g.  IG iv  679 (C 3l\u00adC2e)  where  the  polis  of  the  asks  to  take  part in  the  rites  of  Demeter  at  Hermione. The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  occurs  in Hellenistic  decrees  (e.g.  SEG 11  986  (C 3\u00adC2)).  The  external collective use  occurs  in  Xen.  Hell. 7.1.25,and  the  external  indi- vidual  use  in  Xenophon's references  to Neon  of  Asine  (infra), in  IG ii\u00b2  8387a  (C 4)  and  in  SEG 12  219  ( 322\u00ad310),  a  grant  of proxeny,  theorodokia,  etc.  by  Delphi  to  two  citizens  of  Asine. Asine  was  peopled  with  the  expelled  population  of Argolic  Asine  (Dryopians,  cf.  Hdt. 8.73.2)  when  it  was destroyed  (Theopomp.  fr. 383  apud  Strabo  8.6.11;  Paus. 3.7.4, 4.8.3,  14.3;  cf. 4.24.4,  34.9)  after  the  First  Messenian  War (Lazenby  ( 1972)  85;Harrison  and  Spencer  ( 1998)  154).Its  ter- ritory  was  supposedly  exempt  from  the  general  allotment  of land  after  the  conquest  of  Messenia  (Paus. 4.24.4). In 425,during  the  Sphakteria  campaign,  the  Spartans  sent to  Asine  for  timber  with  which  to  make  siege  engines  (Thuc. 4.13.1).  Later,  in  the  Peloponnesian  War,  the  Spartan  com- mander  Gylippos  had  ships  sent  there  (Thuc. 6.93.3). Neon  of  Asine  (most  likely  from  Messenian  Asine)  took  a leading  part  in  the  expedition  of  the  Ten  Thousand  (Xen. An. 5.3.4,  etc.;  he  is  also  called  ,  7.2.29  (for  a  pos- sible  reason  for  the  variation,  see  Shipley  ( 1997)  209)).In  369 or 368  the  Arkadians  attacked  Asine;  again,  presumably Messenian  Asine  is  meant  (and  it  is  not  contradicted  by   ) since there was a Spartan garrison (  ) there;  they  defeated  it,  killing  its  Spartiate  commander  and devastating  the  outskirts  (proasteion)  of  the  city  (Xen.  Hell. 7.1.25).  After  the  Spartans  lost  part  of  Messenia,  the Asinaians  were  allowed  to  remain  in  their  homeland  (  ,  Paus. 4.27.8);  Asine  was  in  fact  within  the  part  of Messenia  retained  by  Sparta  until  338  (Shipley  ( 2000)  385). Hence,  perhaps,  it  is  put  in  Lakedaimon,  not  Messenia,  by Ps.-Skylax 46.After 338/7  it  may  have  belonged  to  a Messenian  koinon  (cf.  Lazenby  ( 1972)  90).  The  population was  presumably  a  mixture  of  Argolic  Asinaians  (Dryopians; cf.  Hdt. 8.73.2)  and  pre-existing  Messenians  and/or Lakedaimonians. Asine  was  certainly  perioikic;  the  use  of  its  ethnic  for  its citizen  Neon  conforms  to  the  rule  whereby  Lakedaimonian perioikoi  are  identified b y  their  city-ethnics  (Shipley  ( 1997) 209;  Hansen  ( 1996)  185). 314.

No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Thalamai  a  polis,but archaeological  evidence  suggests  that  it  was  a  settlement  and thus  possibly  a  polis.

Byz. 306.1  assigns Thalamai  to  Messenia;  Pausanias  implicitly  places  it  in Lakonike,  since  he  includes  it  in  book  3,  but  attributes  it  to Messenia  in  connection  with  the  legend  of  Tyndareos  ( 3.1.4) and  says  that  the  Messenians  claim  that  the  district  contain- ing  Pephnos  (only  4  km  away)  was  once  theirs  ( 3.26.3).

Byz. 46.5,  who  attributes  it  to  Thuc.). Aithaia  is  not  located  with  certainty,  but  may  have  been near  Thouria  (no. 322)  in  south-eastern  Messenia,  the  only other  perioikic  polis  to  revolt  in  465  (Thuc. 1.101.2).  Valmin ( 1930)  61\u00ad64  suggests  Samarina  (Santa  Marina),  north-east of  the  village  of  Kalogeraki  (or  rather  Kalogerorachi:  see MME 314),  or  one  of  several  sites  in  the  vicinity,  such  as Karteroli  further  south  (Mycenaean,  Hellenistic).  See  also Roebuck  ( 1941)  30\u00ad31  and 7  n. 16;  Lazenby  ( 1972)  86;Hope Simpson  ( 1972)  94  and 98  n. 95.One  possible  site  is  MME  no. 137,  Ellinika  Aithaias  (at  Aithaia,  formerly  Delimimi,  no. 304:Meyer ( 1978)  183);  but  this  is  more  probably  Thouria (no. 322).  If  it  is  Karteroli,  it  had  a  Hellenistic  existence  and so  did  not  cease  to  exist  after  the  liberation  of  Messenia;  but nothing  is  known  about  the  status  of  Aithaia  after  C 5. Aithaia  is  never  called  a  polis  in  Classical  sources,  but apparently  it  was  by  Philoch.  fr. 32a,  who  included  it  as  \"one of  the  100\".  It  may  be  assumed  to  have  been  a  perioikic  polis during  Spartan  rule  on  the  basis  of  Thuc. 1.101.2,  the  only Archaic  or  Classical  use  of  the  city-ethnic  (external  collec- tive).  There  is  no  evidence  for  the  name  or  extent  of  its territory;  it  is  assigned  to  Lakonike  in  Philoch.  fr. 32a  (as  is Thea,  its  possible  double,  in  fr. 32b). Unlike  Mothone  (no. 319)  and  Asine  (no. 313),  Aithaia  is not  said  to  have  been  the  home  of  exiles  from  another  polis. The  ethnic  affiliation of  its  population  therefore  depends  on  whether  the  perioikoi  in  Messenia  were originally Lakedaimonians,  even  Spartiates,  or  ethnic  Messenians  \u00b9\u00b2  References  to komai  in  Laconia  and  Messenia  are  assembled  by  Shipley ( 1997)  261\u00ad63. 558 shipley elevated  above  their  helot  compatriots.  Malkin  ( 1994)  85 tentatively  advances  Thouria  (no. 322)  and  Aithaia  as  possi- ble  C 8  foundations.  Lazenby  ( 1972)  86  assumes  that  the  peo- ple  of  Thouria  and  elsewhere  were  still  \"free  Messenians\" after  the  conquest. Given  its  possible  location,  it  would  have  been  detached from  Sparta  (no. 345)  in  338  rather  than  369.

The  polis  is  plausibly located  at  MME  no. 70  (Kyparissia),  a  site  with  Classical walls,  Hellenistic  and  Roman  buildings;  a  settlement  of 1  ha or  more  (modern  Kyparissia  is  also  called  Arkadia,  no. 2000).  For  the  walls,  see  Valmin  ( 1930)  129\u00ad31  (parts  are C 5  or  later;  some  black-figured pottery);  Hope  Simpson ( 1972)  99  n. 123  (where  \"# 72\"should  read  \"# 70\")  cites  Valmin ( 1930)  131\u00ad32  on  the  extent  of  the  fortifications.

It  seems  also  to  be  implicitly  described  as  a polis  in  the  urban  sense  in  Diod. 15.77.4  (r 365/4).In  the  polit- ical  sense,  polis  is  not  attested  until  the  Roman  era  (SEG 11 1025  (C 2\u00adC1); is  a  near-certain  restoration).  However, the  decree  IG v.11421  (C 4\u00adC3)  demonstrates  that  it  was  a polis  in  the  political  sense  long  before  that  date:  it  uses  the internal  collective  city-ethnic  ( 1\u00ad2),  attests  to  the  existence of  a  territory  ruled  by  the  Kyparissians  ( [  ]            ..., 1\u00ad2),  and  names  a board  of  officials called     ( 9),  a  name that  suggests  the  raising  of  customs  dues.  Moreover,  IG v.2 390  (C 4l\u00adC3e)  is  a  grant  of  proxeny  and  theorodokia  by Arkadian  Lousoi  (no. 279)  to  two  citizens  of  Kyparissos  (cf. Perlman  ( 2000)  241\u00ad42);  and  Polyb. 5.92.5  attests  that  in  217 the  people  were  able  to  mobilise  military  forces. The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  occurs  in  IG v.11421  (C 4\u00adC3);  the  external  collective use  is  attested  at Polyb. 5.92.5,  and  the  external  individual  use  in  IG v.2  390 (C 4l\u00adC3e). In 365/4,  when  Kyparissos  was  captured  by  Arkadian forces,  it  was  evidently  a  defended  settlement  (Diod. 15.77.4) and  thus  quite  probably  perioikic;  alternatively,  it  became  a polis  only  after  this  time;  cf.

In  the  urban  sense,  polis  is  found  in  Dem. 16.25.  The  earliest literary  mention  of  Messene  as  an  existing  polis  is  in  Xen. Hell. 7.1.27;  here  he  does  not  explicitly  call  it  a  polis;however, later  he  mentions  the  recognition  of  its  autonomia  ( 7.1.36: \u00b5     \u00b5),  which  suggests that  he  did  consider  it  a  polis. The  usual  city-ethnic, ,  is  of  course  attested before  the  foundation  of  the  polis,  for  it  was  also  the  region- al  ethnic  of  the  Messenians  (e.g.  IG i\u00b3  1355  ( 475\u00ad450);  ML  74 (c. 421);  Thuc. 4.9.1;  see  Figueira  ( 1999)  and  Luraghi  ( 2002) for  the  development  of  Messenian  identity).  After  369,  the internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  by  coins inscribed  (infra)  and  in  IG v.11425.10 (C 4l\u00adC3e);  the  external  collective  use  is  found  e.g.  in  SEG 29 405.10  ( 365/4),  CID ii  4.i.28  ( 360),  IG ii\u00b2  225.6  ( 343/2)  and  in Xen.  Hell. 7.4.27,  7.5.5.  The  external  individual  use  is  found in  F.Delphes iii.44  ( 340),  IG ii\u00b2  9347  (C 4m),  IG iv\u00b2.1  122.129 (C 4)  and  IvO 172  ( 360\u00ad300).  We  cannot,  however,  always determine  whether  the  ethnic  functions  as  a  city-ethnic  and thus  refers  to citizens  of  the  polis  of  Messene  specifically,  or as  a  regional  ethnic  and  thus  to  members  of  the  wider  com- munity  (ethnos)  of  Messenians.  A  particularly  ambiguous instance  is  found  in  Syll. \u00b3224  (c. 345),  a  response  by  the Amphictyonic  League  to  a  request  by  the   and  the  for  membership  of  the  League:  the  fact that occurs  alongside  suggests that  it  is  here  a  city-ethnic,  whereas  the  request  to  become  an Amphictyonic  member  suggests  that  it  may  be  the  regional ethnic,  since  the  League  was  organised  on  the  basis  of  ethne (Lef\u00e8vre  ( 1998)  17\u00ad20).  When  it  functions  as  the  regional ethnic,  it  is  sometimes  amplified b y  the  addition  of  a  phrase denoting  a  local  community  of  Messenia,  e.g.     (BCH 6  ( 1882)  221  no. 53  F.Delphes iii.45 ( 315\u00ad280))  and      '\u00b5  (BCH 6  ( 1882)  221 no. 52  F.Delphes iii.46  (post- 327/6));  cf.  [] on coins of  c. 330\u00ad280  (Head,  HN \u00b2431\u00ad32). This  plurality  of  usage  may  reflect the fact that a federal structure  was  probably  introduced  after  369,  no  doubt under  Theban  influence,  in  which  the  new  polis  played  the leading  role.  The  koinon  is  attested  in  I.Magnesia 43  ( 207/6):      (cf.  Lazenby  ( 1972)  90;Meyer ( 1978)  283,  arguing  for  isopolity  rather  than  sympolity;  see Polyb. 23.17.2  on  Abia,  Thouria  and  Pharai;  also  McDonald and  Hope  Simpson  ( 1972)  145;  Davis  ( 1998a)  p.  xxx).  In  that case  the  symmachia  treaty  of  the  Arkadian  Confederacy with  the  Messenians  (SEG 22  339,  Olympia  ( 365/4))  may have  been  concluded  with  a  Messenian  koinon  rather  than with  the  polis  of  Messene  alone,  as  may  the  treaty  of  sym- machia  with  Athens  (no. 361)  et al.  attested  in  IG ii\u00b2  225 ( 343/2).The  city  of  Messene  was  no  doubt  meant  to  be  dom- inant,  not  least  for  the  sake  of  the  stability  and  security  of  the region.  To  that  extent  the  other  poleis  of  post-liberation Messenia  can  be  regarded  as  dependent  poleis,  but  there seems  to  have  been  considerable  polis  autonomy:  see Kyparissos  (no. 317)  for  a  decree  on  customs  and  proxeny relations  of  that  polis  in  C 4\u00adC3;  note  also  that  Mothone  (no. 319)  minted  its  own  coins  c.C 3  (Head,  HN \u00b2433).  Even  c. 240 the  polis  of  Messene  made  its  own  treaty  of  isopolity  with Phigaleia  (no. 292)  (IG v.2419  Syll. \u00b3472;Meyer ( 1978) 283).  These  indications  may  hold  good  for  C 4  also;  strong central  control  by Messene  was  perhaps  a  development  of C 3s  or  even  C 3l  rather  than  C 4.It  was  perhaps  during  C 3  that Messenia  came  to  replace  Messene  as  the  usual  name  of  the region  (Meyer  ( 1978)  284).The  federal  arrangement  appears to  have  ended  in  182,  when  Messene  was  required  to  rejoin the  Achaian  Confederacy  separately  from  the  three  poleis  to its  south-east--Abia,  Thouria  (no. 322)  and  Pharai  (no. 320),  which  joined  the  league  individually  (Polyb. 23.17.2). Cf.  also  under  Mothone  infra,  with  reference  to 191. Messene  was  founded  after  the  first Boiotian invasion of Laconia  by  Epameinondas  and  his  allies  in  370/69  (Roebuck ( 1941)  27\u00ad39).  Although  Epiteles  of  Argos  was  put  in  charge of  building  the  polis  (Paus. 4.26.7),  Epameinondas  was  evid- ently  regarded  as  the  oecist,  since  statues  were  erected  to  him (Paus. 4.31.10,32.1);  he  was  revered  as  such  in  the  second  cen- tury  ad  (Paus. 9.14.5,  15.6).  For  an  account  of  how  he  organ- ised  the  construction  of  Messene  and  other  polismata,see 562 shipley Paus. 4.27.5\u00ad7  (cf.  Roebuck  ( 1941)  31\u00ad32  n. 21).  Philip  II  was honoured  as  second  oecist  for  his  benefactions  after Chaironeia  (Strabo  8.4.8).  The  inhabitants  of  the  new  polis included  former  helots  (Isoc. 6.28;  cf.  Roebuck  ( 1941)  34), expatriated  Messenians,  and  \"others  who  so  wished\"  (Diod. 15.66.1;  cf.  Lycurg. 1.62: ...     ). The  territory  of  the  new  polis  probably  embraced  the upper  Messenian  plain  and  the  western  part  of  the  lower one,  marching  with  those  of  Korone  (no. 316)  to  the  south, Pylos  to  the  south-west  (if  it  was  a  polis),  and  Kyparissos  (no. 317)  to  the  west  and  north-west  (Meyer  ( 1978)  150);  probably also  with  that  of  Thouria  (no. 322)  to  the  east;  and  with  those of  the  Arkadian  poleis  to  the  north--unless Dorion and Andania  to  the  north,  and  Ampheia  to  the  north-east,  were poleis.  For  a  possible  network  of  Late  Classical/Early Hellenistic  forts  in  the  chora,  see  Hope  Simpson  ( 1972)  94 with 98\u00ad99  nn. 117\u00ad20;Roebuck ( 1941)  39\u00ad40  n. 68,  59\u00ad60, 64\u00ad65,  122\u00ad24;Valmin  ( 1930)  67\u00ad73,  78\u00ad82,  90,  92\u00ad93.  SEG 34 321  lists  graffiti from a fort at V asiliko  near  Messene,  proba- bly  dating  to  C 5m  and  later. C 4  treaties  concluded  by Messene  include  one  with  Pisa (no. 262)  and  Sikyon  (no. 228)  (Ringel  et al.( 1999)  417\u00ad20), and  at  least  two  with  Athens  (no. 361)  (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 337  and 343  (on  which  see,  however,  Roebuck  ( 1941)  52  n. 113);  Dem. 16.9  with  Roebuck  ( 1941)  47);  though  not  explicitly  attested, alliances  with  Boiotia/Thebes  (no. 221)  (cf.  Xen.  Hell. 7.5.4\u00ad5),  Arkadia  and  Argos  (no. 347)  may  be  assumed  to have  been  concluded  immediately  after  the  foundation (Roebuck  ( 1941)  40\u00ad41).  Messenian  troops  fought  on  the anti-Spartan  side  in  the  battle  of  Mantinea  in  362  (Diod. 15.85.2).  Messene  was  a  party  to  the  koine  eirene  concluded after  the  battle  (Diod. 15.89.1;Ryder ( 1965)  84\u00ad85,  140\u00ad44) and  thus  gained  international  recognition  of  its  existence (Roebuck  ( 1941)  47).  An  alliance  with  Megalopolis  (no. 282) is  attested  by  Diod. 16.39.2\u00ad3  (r 352/1)  and  one  with  Philip  II was  concluded  c. 344  (Roebuck  ( 1941)  49).  Messene  also became  a  member  of  the  Corinthian  League  ([Dem.]  17.4; Roebuck  ( 1941)  55  n. 120);  see,  however,  supra  for  the  possi- bility  that  the  contracting  party  in  such  cases  was  the  ethnos of  the  Messenians  and  not  the  polis  of  Messene. Exiles  restored  by  Alexander  the  Great  are  attested  in [Dem.] 17.4.  IG v.11425  (C 4l\u00adC3e)  is  a  grant  of  proxeny  by Messene  to  a  citizen  of  Zakynthos  (no. 141);  citizens  of Messene  were granted  proxeny  by Delphi  (no. 177)  in  340 (F.Delphes iii.44)  and  326\u00ad316  (F.Delphes iii.46).  Grants  of proxeny  and  theorodokia  by Argos  (no. 347)  to citizens  of Messene  are  listed  in  SEG 13  243  (post- 315). A  C 4l\u00adC3e  decree  (IG v.11425.2)  attests  to  the  existence  of a  phyle  named ,  and  it  seems  probable  that  a  sys- tem  of  five phylai  was  created  at  the  foundation  in  369 (Jones,  POAG 146\u00ad48).  The  existence  of  a  calendar  is  attest- ed  by IG v.11425  (C 4l\u00adC3),  where  a  month  is  referred  to by number: ()  \u017d. Although  Meyer  ( 1978)  151  supposes  the  city's  original constitution  to  have  been  \"oligarchic-timocratic\",  decrees  of the  polis  demonstrate  the  existence  of  democratic  institu- tions.  IG v.11426  (C 4l\u00adC3e)  is  a  decree  for  citizens  of  anoth- er  polis  (cf.  under  Ampheia  in  the  introduction,  supra)  who receive [] and [      ] (SEG 11  1029,  41  321).  IG v.11425  is  a  possibly  C 4\u00adC3  proxeny decree  of  the  damos  (   \u00b5) for a citizen of Zakynthos  (no. 141)  (though  it  is  downdated  to  C 2\u00adC1  by Roebuck  at  SEG 11  1030).  IG v.11435  (  SEG 11  1037)  is  a C 4\u00adC3  list  of  names.  In  SEG 43  135  41  320  ( 317),  the Messenians  made  a  treaty  with  Polyperchon  and  his  son Alexandros  for  the  installation  of  a  garrison  on  Mt.  Ithome; the  text  mentions  the  damos,  presumably  of  Messene.  SEG 45  290  41  322  (C 3e),  an  alliance  of  Messene  with Lysimachos,  probably  dates  from  immediately  before  295/4 (Matthaiou  ( 1990\u00ad91))  and  mentions  ephors  of  the  city  (line 23;  cf.  Polyb. 4.4.2\u00ad3,  4.31.2).  IG v.11471  (C 4),  from  the Artemis  Limnatis  sanctuary,  suggests  that  a  priest,  presum- ably  that  of  Zeus  Ithomatas,  was  the  annual  eponym of  the city.  Arist.  Rh. 1418b11  refers  to the     , presumably  the  assembly  of  the  polis  (or  the  Messenian Federation?). The  site  is  located  below  Mt.  Ithome  by  Paus. 4.31.4,  at  a distance  of  c. 40  stades  ( 7.3  km)  from  the  sources  of  the  river Pamisos  ( 4.31.4)  and  c. 80  stades  ( 15  km)  from  its  mouth ( 4.34.1).  It  is  MME  no. 529,  Mavrommati  (Geometric  to Roman,  including  a  Geometric  figurine),  where  excavations have  been  carried  out  for  the  Archaeological  Society  of Athens,  latterly  by  Themelis  (see  e.g.  AR 47  ( 2000\u00ad1)  48\u00ad49; references  prior  to 1973  collected by  Meyer ( 1978)  137).  The site  is  at  a  considerable  elevation  ( 350\u00ad400  m  above  sea  level: ibid. 139),  in  a  hollow  between  three  hills.  Diod. 15.67.1 appears  to  say  that  the  city  was  built  in  85  days,  though  this can  hardly  have  extended  beyond  a  fort  capable  of  housing the  Theban  garrison.  The  completed  walls  are  among  the finest (cf.  Paus. 4.31.5)  and  best  preserved  in  Greece.  They cannot  be  shown  to  postdate  C 4,  and  should  predate Cassander's  unsuccessful  siege  of 316\u00ad315  (Diod. 19.54.4, 64.1;Meyer ( 1978)  140\u00ad41,  142).  They  are  c. 8  km  long  and enclose  c. 290  ha  (Meyer  ( 1978)  138),  not  all  of  which  was built  up.  The  \"Arkadian  gate\"  in  the  north  wall  is  the  messenia  563 best-known  city  gate  surviving  from  ancient  Greece  (photo- graph  of  part  of  the  wall  and  a  tower:  MME  pl. 9.3).  Mt. Ithome,  above  the  town,  has  polygonal  fortifications proba- bly  dating  from  the  helot  revolt  of  the  460s  (Meyer  ( 1978) 149).  An  unpublished  C 4  inscription  (SEG 45  297)  contains financial accounts of  the  construction  and  repair  of  public and  cult  buildings.  Stamped  roof-tiles  with  fragmentary legends  have  been  found  in  the  C 4l  construction  fill of  the sanctuary  of  Demeter  (see  SEG 45  333\u00ad34).  The  city  exhibits a  Hippodamian  plan.  Some  C 4  buildings  have  been  excavat- ed  (e.g.  a  two-storey  hall  with  Ionic  interior  colonnade, dated  C 4s:  Orlandos,  Ergon  ( 1957)  147\u00ad48).  Most  buildings and  sculptures,  however,  notably  the  Asklepieion  complex, are  Hellenistic  or  Roman;  see  e.g.  Themelis  ( 1994a)  on  the sculptor  Damophon  (also  Alcock  ( 1998)  183,  186\u00ad87). The  important  Messenian  cult  of  Zeus  Ithomatas,  depict- ed  on  the  city's  first c oins  (infra),  was  based  at  Messene (Paus. 4.33.2).  Other  cults  from  the  generations  after  its foundation  include  Artemis  Limnatis  (IG v.11442  (C 3\u00adC2); temple  excavated:  Le  Bas  ( 1844\u00ad45);  Meyer  ( 1978)  149); Artemis  Ortheia  (Themelis  ( 1994b));  Athena  Kyparissia, with  cult  officials ( SEG 23  209\u00ad10  (C 3));  Asklepios  and Hygieia  (e.g.  SEG 38  339  (c. 220?),  45  301  (C 2));  Achelo\u00f6s (SEG 41  360  (early  Hellenistic));  the  Dioskouroi  (SEG 45 302  (c. 300));  Eilethyia  (SEG 41  359  (C 4\u00adC3),  45  303  (C 3)); Herakles  (SEG 41  362  (C 3));  Hermes  (SEG 41  361  (C 3\u00adC2)); and  Poseidon  (SEG 45  305  (seemingly  Late  Classical/Early Hellenistic)).  See  also  Jost  ( 1996).  On  hero  cults,  see Themelis  ( 2000).  Note  also  SEG 45  324  (C 4?),  a  musical notation  (cf.  SEG 43  164,44  382)  in  Doric  mode,  found  in  the Hierothysion  and  presumably  originating  from  a  cult.  The temple  of  Pamisos  at  MME  no. 530,  Ag.  Phloros  (ACHR), excavated  by  Valmin  ( 1938),  may  have  lain  in  the  territory  of Messene.  An  Archaic  stele  was  dedicated  to  the  river Pamisos:  LSAG 206  no. 1  (\"c. 550?\";  now  C 6  or  later,  LSAG \u00b2 448  no.  A;  Richter  ( 1949)  89\u00ad90). As  early  as  368,  Damiskos  of  Messene  (whose  later  career included  Nemean  and  Isthmian  victories)  won  the  boys' stadion  at  Olympia  (Olympionikai 417);  the  victory  of Damaretos  of  Messene  in  boys'  boxing  is  placed  c. 344  by Moretti  (Olympionikai 448),  and  that  of  Telestas,  also  in boys'  boxing,  in  340  (Olympionikai 453). Messene  initiated  minting  in  both  silver  and  bronze shortly  after  the  foundation.

The  toponym  is  (- ),  at  Paus. 8.25.2;  the  entry h in  the Delphic  catalogue  of  theorodokoi  of  C 5l\u00adC4e  (ed.  by  Daux in  REG 62  ( 1949)p.  6  l. 10)  may  refer  to  this  site,  using  an older  form  of  the  toponym  (Daux  ad  loc.  and  Meyer ( 1957a)  86). The  city  deserves  inclusion  in  this  Inventory  only  because it  may  have  had  a  Delphic  theorodokos  in  C 5l\u00adC4e  (supra), and  thus  was  possibly  a  polis  (Perlman  ( 1995)  116,  121,  135). Meyer  ( 1939a)  78\u00ad83  identified H alous  with  the  Palaiokastro at  Syriamou,  south-west  of  Thaliades  (no. 299).  The  site consists  of  a  small  walled  hill  with  the  habitation  area, unwalled,  below.  The  wall  runs  for  c. 640  m  and  encloses  an area  of 1.7  ha;  it  dates  from  C 4,  according  to Meyer;  sherds and  tiles  from  the  walled  area  date  to  the  Classical  and Hellenistic  periods.  In  the  habitation  area  outside  the  wall Meyer  made  \"massenhaften  Ziegel-  und  Scherbefunde\".  The inhabited  area  was  considerable,  according  to  Meyer,  but  he does  not  estimate  the  size  of  the  city  proper. 273. ", "Trapezous": "Identifier: 535, (Trapezountios) Map  58.  Lat. 37.25,long. 22.05.  Size  of  territory: 1  or 2.  Type:  C.  The  toponym  is (Hdt. 6.127.3);  the  ethnic  is   (Paus  8.27.5  (r 371)). Trapezous  is  called  polis  in  the  urban  or  political  sense  at Paus. 8.27.4  (r 371)  and--implicitly-- at  Hdt. 6.127.3. The  collective  use  of  the  ethnic  is  found  at  Paus. 8.27.5  (r 371), probably  taken  over  from  a  historiographic  source. The  territory  is  called at  Paus. 8.29.1.  According  to  Paus. 8.27.4,  Trapezous  was  among  the communities  that  the  Arkadian  Confederacy  decreed to  relocate  to  Megalopolis  (no. 282);  however,  the Trapezountioi  resisted  the  decision,  but  a  part  of  the  popu- lation  was  relocated  by  use  of  force,  whereas  another  part left  the  Peloponnese  (Paus. 8.27.5).  The  synoecism  thus meant  the  end  of  the  city's  existence  (cf.  Meyer  ( 1937b) 2213). The  city  was  a  Parrhasian  community  and  a  member  of the  Arkadian  Confederacy  (Paus. 8.27.4;  Nielsen  ( 1996a) 132\u00ad34).  Membership  of  the  Peloponnesian  League  is  not explicitly  attested,  but  may  be  assumed;  it  was  probably mediated  by  the  tribal  state  of  the  Parrhasians  (Nielsen ( 1996c)  100\u00ad1),  and  the  same  is  true  of  the  C 5  alliance  with Mantinea  (no. 281)  (ibid. 79\u00ad86). There  is  a  very  brief  report  on  an  excavation  at  a  site which  may  be  Trapezous  (modern  Mavria)  by  Stephanos  in Prakt  ( 1907)  123;  he  reports  remains  of  several  buildings  and sherds  \"of  Hellenic  times\"  (i.e.  Hellenistic;  cf.  Jost  ( 1985) 170).  However,  recent  rescue  excavations  near  modern Kyparissia  (c. 20  km  north-west  of  Megalopolis)  by  A.  V.  Karapanagiotou  have  brought  to  light  a  new  candidate for  Trapezous:  a  city  with  a  rectangular  street  plan  and  a  for- tification wall w ith  rectangular  towers,  of  considerable  size ( 18  ha)  though  not  excavated  in  its  entirety,  and  dated  by  the excavator  to  the  earlier  fifth c entury;  the  earliest  material  is C 6  ceramic  material;  a  C 6\u00adC4  sanctuary  is  located  1.5  km from  the  city  (information  derived  from  public  lecture  by  A.  V.  Karapanagiotou  in  Athens,  May  2002;  for  earlier  finds at  the  site,  see  Bather  and  Yorke  ( 1892\u00ad93)  229\u00ad30;  Jost  ( 1985) 170).  If  not  to  be  equated  with  Trapezous,  the  site  may  be ancient  Basilis  (Paus. 8.29.5). According  to  Paus. 8.31.5,  some  old  xoana  of  Hera,  Apollo and  the  Muses  found  at  Megalopolis  had  been  transferred  to the  city  from  Trapezous;  the  likely  date  is  the  360s,  and  we may  thus  assume  that  before  that  date  Trapezous  possessed cults  of  these  divinities;  cf.

The  toponym  is in  SEG 35  371  (C 5f);  Ps.-Skylax 44,  SEG 36  147.B fr.  d. 7  (c. 368)  and  Polyb. 4.68.6  have  \u00b5,  (cf.  at Paus. 8.22.2),  and  Hom.  Il. 2.608  has \u00b5.The city-ethnic  is  \u00b5  (Pind.  Ol. 6.99;  SEG 20  716.20 (C 4m)). Stymphalos  is  listed  as  the  fifth t oponym  after  the  head- ing   \u00b5   (where  polis  is  used  in  the urban  sense)  at  Ps.-Skylax  44.  In  the  political  sense  polis  is used  about  the  city  in,  e.g.,  IG v.2352  (C 4s)  and  SEG 32  370 quater  (c. 315); is  found  in  IG v.2351.3  (C 4l), in  IG v.2358  (C 3f),  and in  IPArk  no. 17.176  (C 4l).  The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is found  in  IG v.2352.1\u00ad2  (C 4l)  and  on  C 4  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2 454);  externally,  the  individual  use  is  found  at  Xen.  An. 1.1.11 and  in  IG iv\u00b21  102  A 23  (C 4),  and  the  collective use  in  Pind. Ol. 6.99  and  SEG 20  716.20  (C 4m). The  lake  near  the  city  was  called  \u00b5 \u00b5 (Hdt. 6.76.3);  the  size  of  this  lake  varied,  and  it  sometimes extended  to  the  southern  part  of  the  city,  which  itself  occu- pied  the  lacustrine  plain.  The  size  of  the  territory  was  c. 180 arkadia  529 km \u00b2.  Near  Lafka,  c. 6  km  south-west  of  the  city,  is  a  late Classical/Hellenistic  cemetery,  and  Doric  architectural  frag- ments. Stymphalian  membership  of  the  Peloponnesian  League may  be  assumed  (Nielsen  ( 1996c)  87).  Membership  of  the Arkadian  Confederacy  is  proved  by  Xen.  Hell. 7.3.1  (B\u00f6lte ( 1931)  447).  A  treaty  of  symbola  was  concluded  with  Athens (no. 361)  in  C 4m  (cf.  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 279;  SEG 36  147),and  one with  Demetrias Sikyon  (no. 228)  in  C 4l  (IPArk  no. 17);  in C 3f  a treaty  of  sympoliteia  vel  sim.  was  concluded  with Lousoi  (no. 279)  (IG  V. 2358). In SEG 36  147  fr.  a. 4  (c. 368)  occurs  the  expression ] [,  which  may  indicate  the  exchange  of envoys  and  the  existence  of  proxenia  relations  between Athens  and  Stymphalos  before  the  final c onclusion  of  the treaty  (of  symbola);  see  Walbank  ( 1986)  333  note  ad  fr.  a. 4  and 350\u00ad51;  Stymphalos  granted  proxenia  to  an  unknown  man  in C 4s  (IG v.2352),  and  had  one  of  its  own  citizens  appointed Delphic  proxenos  and  theorodokos  c. 360  (Syll. \u00b3  189);  an  Argive theorodokos  resided  in  the  city  c. 330  (SEG 23  189.24). The  earliest  surviving  public  enactments  are  a  series  of C 4s  decrees  (IG v.2351\u00ad56),  for  which  see  Taueber  ( 1981).  A death  sentence  is  recorded  at  SEG 20  716.20  (C 4m).  A  boule is  attested  at  IG v.2351  and 356  (C 4s),  and  a  board  of prostatai  bolas  at  IG v.2351;a board of  damiorgoi  at  IG v.2351 too.  An  assembly  ( ) is attested at IPArk  no. 17.194; its  ordinary  name  was  probably  polis  (IG v.2352  (C 4s)). The  public  architecture  of  Stymphalos  is  still  imperfectly known;  the  agora  has  not  been  located  with  certainty  (H. Williams  ( 1984)  186;  but  see  B\u00f6lte  ( 1931)  443  and  Jost  ( 1985) 104\u00ad5).  An  area  of  seating  cut  in  the  bare  rock  south  of  the acropolis  suggests  the  existence  of  a  theatre  (H.  Williams ( 1983)  200,(1984)  176\u00ad77;  cf.  Frederiksen  ( 2002)  67).  The acropolis  is  included  within  the  circuit;  here  three  temples are  known,  not  all  of  them  firmly dated,  but  one  possibly dedicated  to  Athena  Polias  is  C 4m  (H.  Williams,  pers. comm.)  and  has  yielded  late  Archaic  and  Classical  sculpture (H.  Williams  et al.( 1997)  44,  pers.  comm.). Pind.  Ol. 6.99  uses  the  phrase   \u00b5 ,thus suggesting the existence of  a  C 5f  fortification; at 8.8.4,  Strabo  mentions  a  siege  of  Stymphalos  by Iphikrates,  which  probably  occurred  in  369  (Dusani\u017dc ( 1970) 332  n. 9).  The  preserved  wall  is  C 4m  or  C 4l,  and  is  construct- ed  in  mudbrick  on  a  stone  foundation  (H.  Williams  and Price  ( 1995)  8;  Williams  et al.( 1997)  66).  It  was  2,300  m  long and  is  described  by  H.  Williams  ( 1983),  ( 1984);  it  seems  to have  enclosed  an  area  of  at  least  40  ha  (calculated  on  the basis  of  H.  Williams  ( 1983)  fig. 1). According  to  Paus. 8.22.1\u00ad2,  old  Stymphalos  was  not  in the  same  place  as  the  known  city,  but  we  have  no  idea  about where  this  can  have  been  (Jost  ( 1985)  101,  105);  however,  at the  village  of  Lafka,  part  of  a  well-preserved  polygonal  cir- cuit  wall  has  been  found,  thus  providing  a  possible  candi- date  for  early  Stymphalos  (H.  Williams,  pers.  comm.).  The later  city  was  \"laid  out  as  an  orthogonally  planned  town some  time  in  the  fourth  century  ( 375\u00ad350,p.  8);  it  had  a sophisticated  grid  of  streets  and  blocks  apparently  laid  out on  a  module  of 110  Doric  feet,  or  36  m,  for  width  of  street  and block,  inside  a  well-built  circuit  of  stone  and  mud  brick walls  that  encompassed  a  relatively  low  acropolis  near  the lake  as  well  as  the  flat t errain  to  the  north  and  east  of  it\" (H.  Williams  and  Price  ( 1995)  1).  So  far,  the  earliest  pottery from  the  site  is  Late  Archaic  (ibid. 8);  sufficient Classical pottery  has  now  been  found  to  push  the  existence  of  the town  back  into  C 5  (H.  Williams  et al.( 1997)  41,43;  part  of  the road  system  may  also  predate  C 4:ibid.42).There  is  evidence for  several  late  Archaic  or  early  Classical  peri-urban  Doric temples  (H.  Williams  and  Price  ( 1995)  20;  H.  Williams  et al. ( 1997)  67). Athena  Polias  is  attested  by  SEG 11  1111  (C 4),  but  the patron  deity  of  the  city  was  probably  Artemis:  she  is  depict- ed  on  coins,  and  her  sanctuary  was  used  for  publication  of decrees  (IG v.2351.9\u00ad10  (C 4l)).  In  C 5,  Dromeus  of Stymphalos  was  periodonikes  (Knab  ( 1934)  no. 3). According  to  Head,  HN \u00b2,the  coinage  of  Stymphalos  began c. 400;  according  to  Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 3.  593\u00ad94  it  began  c. 420. The  city  struck  in  both  silver  and  bronze.  The  legend  is  , (bronze  coins),  and  ,  , ,  ,  (sil- ver  coins).  Known  denominations  are  obol,  triobol  and stater.  The  types  depict  Artemis,  Herakles  and  the Stymphalian  birds.  The  rev.  type  of  the  staters  (Herakles  with club)  is  discussed  by  Schefold  ( 1963\u00ad64).  SNG  Cop.

Il. 2.607; IvO 268  (c. 460));  Diod. 11.66.3  (r 467/6)  has  .The city\u00adethnic  is  invariably  (IG v.2  159  (C 5);  SEG 37 676  (C 4f)),  of  which  the  Ionic  form  is  (Hdt. 1.65.1). Tegea  is  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  at  Simon. 122, Diehl Anth.  Pal. 7.512,possibly  C 5f  (Molyneux  ( 1992)  201), or  c. 369  (Pritchett  ( 1985)  217\u00ad19),  Hdt. 7.202,  204,  and  SEG 11 1051  (C 4e);  in  the  urban  sense  polis  is  used  about  it  at  Thuc. 530 nielsen 5.62.2,Xen.  Hell. 7.5.8  and  Ps.-Skylax  44,  who  lists  it  as  the first t oponym  after  the  heading    \u00b5 , where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense.  The  territorial  sense  of polis  (with  the  political  sense  as  a  possible  connotation) occurs  in  Xen.  Hell. 7.5.5  (for  which  see  Nielsen  ( 1996c) 72\u00ad73).  Xen.  Hell. 6.5.7  and  IG v.239  (C 4)  use  , whereas  IG v.23.11  (C 5l\u00adC4e)  makes  a  distinction  between and .  There  was  an  Aristotelian   (frr. 608\u00ad9).  IPArk  no. 5  (c. 324)  uses  at l. 21,and  at  l. 28  it  uses  to  distinguish  the  ordinary lawcourt  of  the  city  from  an  ad  hoc  court,  called       and  presumably  composed  of citizens  from  a  foreign  polis  (IPArk  p. 65),  established  to adjudicate  the  claims  of  returning  exiles.  SEG 22  287  (C 3) uses about  the  city  and  the  poetess  Anyte   (Anth.  Pal. 6.153  Gow  and  Page  ii).  A  C 4  tile  is  stamped (IG v.2  170.1). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  internally  in IG v.2  159  (C 5),  and  externally  in  ML  27.3,  Hdt. 1.65.1  and Thuc. 4.143.1.  The  individual  use  is  found  externally  in  Hdt. 9.9.1,  Thuc. 2.67.1,  IG i\u00b3  1371  bis  (c. 410)  and  SEG 37  676  (C 4f). The  territory occupied  c. 385  km \u00b2.  It  is  described  as  a    in  a  C 6  oracle  reported  at  Hdt. 1.66.2.Its name  was  (  ) ( ) (Thuc.  5.64.4;Xen.  Hell. 6.5.15).  Hdt. 1.66.4  calls  the  territory      ,  and  it  is  termed  at  Xen.  Hell. 6.5.6.The border  with  Lakonia  is  referred  to at  Hdt. 8.124.3  (  ).  Near  this  border,  at  Analipsis,  was  a  Classical sanctuary  which  seems  to  have  been  associated  with  a  small settlement  (Jost  ( 1985)  161).At  Mavriki  south-east  of  the  city was  a  C 6  Doric  marble  temple  (Voyatzis  ( 1990)  29\u00ad30).  Just north  of  the  city,  on  Ag.  Sostis,  is  an  Archaic  sanctuary  which perhaps  included  a  C 5  temple  (Jost  ( 1985)  155).  For  two  C 4 fortified watch-towers in the t erritory,  see  Pikoulas  ( 1995) cat.  nos. 42\u00ad43.  According  to  Strabo  8.3.2,  Tegea  was  (at  an uncertain  date)  synoecised  from  nine  demes,  whose  names are  given  at  Paus. 8.45.1.The  nature  of  the  settlement  pattern and  the  political  organisation  before  the  synoecism  are completely  unknown,  but  the  areas  of  the  demes  can  be roughly  located  (cf.  Voyatzis  ( 1990)  10\u00ad11  with  fig. 2);  two  of the  demes,  those  of  the  Karyatai  and  the  Oiatai,  seem  to  have been  annexed  by  the  Spartans  at  an  early  date  and  to  have alternated  between  inclusion  in  Tegea  and  Sparta  (no. 345) (cf.  Shipley  ( 1997)  233\u00ad34,  238\u00ad39;  Nielsen  ( 1999)  49). Tegea  fielded  500  hoplites  for  Thermopylai  (Hdt. 7.202), but  at  Plataiai  the  city  provided  1,500  (Hdt. 9.27.3)  in  addi- tion  to  1,500  psiloi  (Hdt. 9.61.2);  at  the  battle  of  Nemea  in  394 the  city  may  have  fielded upwards of 2,400  hoplites  (Roy ( 1971b)  440).  Finally,  the  stasis  of 370  sent 800  oligarchs  into exile  at  Sparta  (Xen.  Hell. 6.5.10).  These  figures suggest a substantial  population,  but  its  exact  size  cannot  be  estimat- ed  (cf.  Fors\u00e9n  ( 2000)  36\u00ad39),  and  it  is,  furthermore,  not known  how  large  a  fraction  of  the  population  resided  in  the town. According  to  Hdt. 1.66.3,  the  Spartans  in  C 6f  planned  to subject  Tegea  to  an  exandrapodismos,  but  were unsuccessful. It  is  often  believed  that  it  was  this  conflict that led,  around C 6m,  to the  conclusion  of  the  treaty  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 112  (cf. p. 11);  an  alliance  between  Tegea  and  Sparta  antedating  the Persian  Wars  is  certainly  implied  by  Hdt. 9.26.2,  but  the treaty Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 112  is  now  thought  to  belong  to  C 5f (Cawkwell  ( 1993)  368\u00ad70;  Braun  ( 1994)  42\u00ad45;  cf.  Osborne ( 1996)  287\u00ad89).  C 5  membership  of  the  Peloponnesian League  can  be  inferred  from  numerous  passages  in Thucydides  ( 2.67.1,  5.32.3,  57.2,  67.1),  and  C 4  membership  is proved  by,  e.g.,  Xen.  Hell. 4.2.13.A C 5f  alliance  with  Argos (no. 347)  can  be  inferred  from  Hdt. 9.35.2  (cf.  Strabo  8.6.19, who  gives  a  vague  chronological  reference: \u00b5      \u00b5 \u00b5):  Argos  assisted  Tegea  in  a  battle against  Sparta  (Hdt.),  and  Tegea  assisted  Argos  against Mykenai  (no. 353)  (Strabo).  The  same  Herodotean  passage allows  the  inference  that  Tegea  at  one  point  in  C 5f  was  the leader  of  an  anti-Spartan  alliance  comprising  all  Arkadia except  Mantinea  (no. 281);  cf.  Nielsen  ( 1996b)  218\u00ad20.From Thuc. 4.134.1  it  appears  that  Tegea,  like  Mantinea,  was  the leader  of  a  local  alliance;  cf.  Nielsen  ( 1996c)  79\u00ad86. In 370,  Tegea  joined  the  Arkadian  Confederacy,  but  only after  a  bloody  civil  war  which  sent  800  oligarchs  into  exile (Xen.  Hell. 6.5.6\u00ad9).  Tegea  became  a  leading  member  pro- viding  oecists  for  the  foundation  of  Megalopolis  (no. 282) (Paus. 8.27.2).  When  the  Confederacy  split  in  two  in  363, Tegea  with  Megalopolis  remained  loyal  to  Boiotia  (Xen. Hell. 7.5.5),  whereas  Mantinea  joined  Sparta;  Diod. 15.82.2 refers  to  Tegea  as  the  leader  of  the  faction  opposing Mantinea. Tegean  military  commanders  are  referred  to at  Hdt. 7.202 and 204,and are  mentioned  in  a  C 4m  law  (IPArk no. 3.9).  Five  hundred  Tegean  hoplites  were  present  at Thermopylai  (Hdt. 7.202);  1,500  hoplites  and  1,500  other troops  fought  at  Plataiai  (Hdt. 9.28.3,  61.2),  and  Tegean troops  fought  at  Mantinea  in  418  (Thuc. 5.67.1)  and  at Nemea  in  394  (Xen.  Hell. 4.2.20). A  Tegean  envoy  to  the  Persian  king  is  mentioned  at  Thuc. 2.67.1,  and  according  to Diod. 15.82.3 ", "Nestane": "Identifier: 285. , (Nestanios) Map  58.

An. 4.1.27;  IPArk  no. 14.6\u00ad7  ( 360s,  from  Orchomenos) has ,  which  points  to  an  epichoric  toponym * . The  only  Classical  source  that  possibly  classified Methydrion  as  a  polis  is  Theopomp.  fr. 344.18  (  Porph.  Abst. 2.16);  at  Paus. 8.27.4  (r 371)  the  city  is  listed  as  a  polis.The collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  internally  on  coin legends  (Head,  HN \u00b2451)  and  externally  in  IPArk  no. 14.6\u00ad7; the  individual  use  is  found  externally  at  Xen.  An. 4.6.20. Thuc. 5.58.2  (      \u00b5  ) suggests that the toponym could designate the territory  as  well.  An  inscription  from  Orchomenos  refers  to  a point  where  the  borders  of  Methydrion  met  those  of Orchomenos  (no. 286)  and  Torthyneion  (no. 302)  (IPArk  no. 14.4\u00ad6);  this  allows  the  conclusion  that  C 4m  Methydrion  had a  well-defined t erritory  and  that  it  abutted  those  of Torthyneion  and  Orchomenos;  in  the  fragmentary  C 5l\u00adC4e Delphic  list  of  theorodokoi,  the  city  is  listed  just  before Torthyneion  (REG 62  ( 1949)  p. 6  ll. 6\u00ad9). According  to  Paus. 8.27.4,  Methydrion  was  in  371  one  of  a number  of  communities  whose  relationship  to  Orchomenos could  be  described  by  the  phrase   .  It  is  unclear exactly  what  this  means,  but  Methydrion  was  presumably  in 522 nielsen one  way  or  another  a  dependency  of  Orchomenos  (cf.  Hejnic ( 1961)  37\u00ad38;  Roy ( 1972c)  78;  Nielsen  ( 1996b)  231\u00ad36;(1996c) 84\u00ad86). At  Petrovouni, 3  km  west  of  the  city,  a  sanctuary  has  been found;  the  temple  is  Hellenistic,  but  architectural  fragments and  votives  go  back  to  C 7  (Jost  ( 1985)  215). Membership  of  the  Peloponnesian  League  may  be assumed;  in  418,  a  League  army  camped  in  the  territory  of  the city  (Thuc. 5.58.2).Membership  of  the  Arkadian  Confederacy can  be  inferred  from  Paus. 8.27.4  (r 371).  It  is  furthermore  not impossible  that  the  synteleia  of  Orchomenos  mentioned  at Paus. 8.27.4,  and  of  which  Methydrion  was  a  part,  was  an organisation  based  on  formal  treaties  (Nielsen  ( 1996b)  234). According  to  Paus. 8.27.4,  Methydrion  was  among  the communities  that  the  Arkadian  Confederacy  voted  to  relo- cate  to  Megalopolis  (no. 282).  IPArk  no. 14  ( 360s)  seems  to demarcate  the  border  with  Orchomenos  and  may  be  taken to  indicate  that  steps  were  taken  to  implement  this  decision (cf.  IPArk  on  no. 14;  Nielsen  ( 1996c)  84).However,it  is  uncer- tain  whether  Megalopolis  in  the  Classical  period  effectively controlled  the  city,  which  was  clearly  not  abandoned (Moggi  ( 1974)  93\u00ad94;  Nielsen  ( 1996b)  316\u00ad19). In C 5l\u00adC4e  a  Delphic  theorodokos  resided  in  the  city  (REG 62  ( 1949)  p. 6  l. 6).  The  earliest  surviving  reference  to  a  pub- lic  enactment  by  Methydrion  is  I.Magnesia 38.61,  which attests  to  a  C 3l  asylia  decree  for  Magnesia. The  preserved  fortification wall at M ethydrion  is Classical,  C 5  according  to  von  Gaertringen  and  Lattermann ( 1911)  31,C4  according  to  Jost  ( 1985)  213  n. 8.The  wall  enclos- es  an  area  of 11  ha  (von  Gaertringen  and  Lattermann  ( 1911) 31).  They  noted  some  foundations,  sherds  and  tiles  inside the  wall,  and  suggested  the  existence  of  a  large  temple  (but gave  no  date,  ibid. 23,  31).  The  oldest  find at the site is an Archaic  statuette  of  Zeus  (Jost  ( 1985)  214\u00ad15).  According  to Theopomp.  fr. 344.27\u00ad8  (  Porph.  Abst. 2.16),  Methydrion was  a  small,  poor  place  ( \u00b5     \u00b5  ).  Several  Arkadian  towns,  such  as Halous  (no. 272)  and  Pallantion  (no. 289),  consist  of  a  forti- fied acropolis w ith  the  residential  area  unfortified below.  It is  not  clear  whether  Methydrion  was  such  a  city;  if  it  was,  the fortified area can be equated w ith  the  acropolis. Cults  of  Zeus  Hoplosmios  and  Poseidon  Hippios  are attested  (Jost  ( 1985)  214),  and  Theopomp.  fr. 344  mentions  \u00b5  and  public  .  According  to Paus. 8.36.2,  citizens  of  Methydrion  achieved  Olympic  victories before  371  (Olympionikai 410\u00ad11). From  Methydrion  comes  a  bronze  coinage  of,  presum- ably,  C 4  (Meyer  ( 1932)  1389\u00ad90),  though  other  dates  have been  proposed,  see  ibid.  and  Moggi  ( 1974)  93  n. 72.  The  leg- end  is  ;  the  types  show  rev.  Zeus;  obv. Kallisto  in  the  shape  of  a  woman,  falling  back  pierced  by  an arrow  with  Arkas  on  the  ground  beside  her:  this  type  is  \"aus Orchomenos  entlehnt\"  (Meyer  ( 1932)  1389);  on  the  signific- ance  of  this,  see  Nielsen  ( 1996b)  234\u00ad36. 284.

The  epichoric  and  Doric form  of  the  toponym  is  ,  (SEG 37  340.6  (C 4f);  IG v.1  1124  (C 5l));  the  regular  Ionic  form  is  (Hom.  Il. 2.607;  Hdt. 4.161.2),  but  Hecat.  fr. 123  (  Steph.  Byz. 13.8) apparently  used  the  synaloiphic  form  .  The  Attic form  is  (Eupolis  fr. 99.30,  K&amp;A;  Thuc. 5.55.1). The  city-ethnic  is  invariably  (Hdt. 4.162.2;  CID ii  1.ii.24  ( 360)).  For  ethnic  and  toponym,  see  further  B\u00f6lte ( 1930)  1290\u00ad92. Mantinea  is  called  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Thuc. 5.33.2, Ephor.  fr. 79,  Ps.-Skylax 44  (who  lists  it  as  the  second toponym  after  the  heading    \u00b5 ,where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense),  and  at  Isoc.  Paneg. 126;in the  territorial  sense  at  Xen.  Hell. 5.2.6;  and  in  the  political sense  at  Hdt. 7.202  and 204,  Thuc. 5.47.3,  and  IG i\u00b3  83.15\u00ad17 ( 420).  Hermippos  apud  Ath. 4.41  (rC 6)  uses  (Hdt. 4.161.2  (rC 6m)  has  );  Isoc.  Paneg. 125  uses  (opposed  to  \u00b5);  Ael.

The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  internally  in SEG 37  340  (C 4f),  and  externally  at  Hdt. 4.161.2  (rC 6m), Bacchyl.  fr. 21,  Thuc. 3.107.4,  IvO 16.17  (C 5m)  and  IG i\u00b3  83.4 ( 420);  the  individual  use  is  attested  externally  only,  e.g.  Hdt. 4.162.2  (rC 6m),  SEG 26  330  (C 4),  CID ii  1.ii.24  ( 360)  and Xen.  Hell. 7.1.23. The  territory occupied  c. 295  km \u00b2  (cf.  Hodkinson  and Hodkinson  ( 1981)  275  n. 128),  and  its  name  was   (Thuc. 5.64.5;Xen.Hell.6.5.15).However,the  passage  at  Thuc. 5.64.4  (         ... ) sug- gests  that  the  toponym  could  also  designate  the  territory.  The territory is termed by  Hdt. 9.77.3,  Thuc. 5.64.5  and  Xen. Hell. 5.2.4,  and at  Xen.  Hell. 6.5.15;  for  the  territory,  see Hodkinson  and  Hodkinson  ( 1981)  242\u00ad46.  The  neighbours were,  to  the  north,  Orchomenos  (no. 286);  to  the  east,  Argos (no. 347);  to  the  south,  Tegea  (no. 297);  and  to  the  west, Mainalia.  Extra-urban  sanctuaries  are  known,  e.g.  one  of Herakles  mentioned  at  Thuc. 5.64.5  (for  which  see  Pritchett ( 1969)  46\u00ad49);  see  also  Jost  ( 1985)  132\u00ad41.  The  important sanctuary  of  Poseidon  Hippios,  the  tutelary  god  of  the  city (Brackertz  ( 1976)  68\u00ad71),was  situated  1.3  km  south  of  the  city; it  has  been  located,  but  no  substantial  finds have been pub- lished  (Jost  ( 1985)  136);  however,  the  web  site  of  the  Hellenic Ministry  of  Culture  actionURI(www.culture.gr):(www.culture.gr s.v.  `The  Sanctuary  of Hippios  Poseidon'  as  assessed  21  January  2003)  reports:  \"The excavations  of  Th.  Spyropoulos  in  1985\u00ad95  revealed  remains of  the  Archaic  temple  and  important  objects  of  the  same  peri- od  (clay  akroterion  of  Lakonic  type  bearing  Gorgoneion, pottery  of  Archaic  and  Classical  date,  idols,  etc.).  The  excava- tions  also  uncovered  later  buildings  and  tombs  preserving ancient  liberative  inscriptions  dedicated  to  Hippios Poseidon.\"  For  a  group  of  four  C 4  fortified watch-towers in the  territory,  see  Pikoulas  ( 1995)  cat.  nos. 38\u00ad41;  see  also  Jost ( 2001\u00ad2)  esp.  fig. 1,  noting  a  new  tower  at  Simiades. The  town  of  Mantinea  (the  date  of  whose  foundation  is uncertain;  see  Hodkinson  and  Hodkinson  ( 1981)  256\u00ad61) was  not  the  only  settlement  in  Mantinean  territory.  A  num- ber  of  sources  state  that  at  the  dioikismos  in 385  (infra)  the Mantineans  were  dispersed  to  the  old  villages,  komai,  which was  their  old  pre-synoecistic  way  of  life.  It  seems  likely  that these  villages  were  the  ones  from  which  the  city  was  orig- inally  synoecised  (infra);  but  it  is  unknown  whether  they were  inhabited  between  the  original  synoecism  and  the dioikismos  (Hodkinson  and  Hodkinson  ( 1981)  261\u00ad63), although  it  seems  probable  (B\u00f6lte  ( 1930)  1318;  Hodkinson and  Hodkinson  ( 1981)  264;  Jost  ( 1986a)  155).  The  identity  of these  komai  is  not  clear  from  Classical  sources,  but Pausanias  mentions  a  number  of  sites  that  are  possibly  to  be identified w ith  at  least  some  of  them  (Jost  ( 1986a)  155\u00ad56). Hodkinson  and  Hodkinson  ( 1981)  262  have  identified two of the  villages  with  surviving  remains:  (a)  Nestane  (no. 284), c. 7.5  km  west  of  Mantinea  town.  The  site  occupies  the  hill  of Nestani,  measures  160 40  m,  and  was  fortified c. 370 (Hodkinson  and  Hodkinson  ( 1981)  247).  There  are  some foundations  on  the  summit,  and  a  few  Classical  and Hellenistic  sherds  were  found  there  (Howell  ( 1970)  87).  A lower  ridge  runs  east\u00adwest  for  350  m  and  is  probably  the  site of  the  village  (Hodkinson  and  Hodkinson  ( 1981)  246\u00ad48); (b)  Maira,  c. 5.7  km  north  of  Mantinea  town  (ibid. 248\u00ad50). At  modern  Gourtsouli,  probably  ancient  Ptolis,  just  north  of the  town,  there  is  evidence  of  cult  and  habitation  down to C 6l,  thereafter  of  cult  only  (ibid. 252\u00ad56);  see,  however,  AR ( 1990\u00ad91)  26  reporting  early  Hellenistic  habitation  on  the eastern  slope. It  seems  reasonably  certain  that  at  least  in  some  periods the  Mantinike  included  a  number  of  settlements  which  were themselves  organised  as  poleis.  Thus,  Nestane  had  its  own ethnic  in  C 4,  which  indicates  that  the  city  was  organised  as  a polis  (and  thus  as  a  dependent  polis  within  Mantinean  territ- ory)  since  no  Arkadian  sub-ethnics  are  known  (Nielsen ( 1996a)  117\u00ad32);  it  is  likely  that  during  the  dioikismos Nestane  and  (some  of)  the  other  individual  komai  rose  to polis  status  (Polyb. 4.27.6  (r 385)),  and  that  this  was  recog- nised  at  the  new  synoecism  in  370  (Xen.  Hell. 6.5.3). However,  even  prior  to the  dioikismos  the  Mantinike  includ- ed  other  poleis  besides  Mantinea.  Thus,  it  is  clear  from  the treaty SEG 37  340  (C 4f)  that  by  this  treaty  the  Mantinike  was enlarged  to  cover  the  territory  of  Helisson  (no. 273),and  that Helisson  persisted  as  a  (dependent)  polis  within  Mantinean territory;  the  text  furthermore  shows  that  Helisson  was  not the  only  polis  in  this  position;  others  may  have  been  some  of the  original  komai  or  other  Mainalian  communities  such  as Dipaia  (no. 268),  etc.;  cf.  Nielsen  ( 1996c)  66\u00ad70. At  Thermopylai  Mantinea  contributed  500  hoplites  (Hdt. 7.202),  and  in  420,  1,000  soldiers  helped  to  protect  the Olympic  Games  against  an  anticipated  Spartan  attack. According  to  Lys. 34.7,  the  Mantineans  did  not  number 3,000;  it  is  not  possible  to  give  any  exact  estimate  of  the  size of  population  on  this  basis  (cf.  Fors\u00e9n  ( 2000)  36\u00ad39);  Xen. Hell. 5.2.7  implies  that  in  385  residence  in  the  town  was  the norm  in  Mantinea. Mantinea  was  a  member  of  the  Hellenic  League  against Persia  (Hdt. 7.202)  and  of  the  Peloponnesian  League  (Thuc. 5.29.2;Xen.  Hell. 5.2.3;  cf.  Tuplin  ( 1977)),  but  relations  with 518 nielsen Sparta  (no. 345)  were very varied  and  seldom  easy  (Nielsen ( 1996c)  90\u00ad91).  In  421  Mantinea  defected  from  the  League and  concluded  an  alliance  with  Argos  (Thuc. 5.29.1),  which was  followed  the  next  year  by the  conclusion  of  a  quadruple alliance  of  Argos  (no. 347),  Athens  (no. 361),  Elis  (no. 251) and  Mantinea  (Thuc. 5.47  IG i\u00b3  80).  However,  after  the defeat  at  Mantinea  in  418  (exactly  when  is  unknown), Mantinea  came  to  terms  with  Sparta  again  (Thuc. 5.81.1); and  it  remained  an  ally  of  Sparta  (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.1)  down to the  foundation  of  the  Arkadian  Confederacy  after  Leuktra. Inside  Arkadia,  Mantinea  was  a  major  power,  and  in  C 5s  it led  a  league  that  included  all  the  Parrhasians  and  some  of  the Mainalians  (see  Nielsen  ( 1996c)  79\u00ad84  for  details),  who  were reduced  to  dependencies.  In C 4f  Helisson  was  reduced  to dependent  status  through  a  treaty  of  what  amounts  to  sym- politeia  (SEG 37  340).  The  city  was  also  a  leading  member  of the  Arkadian  Confederacy  (IG v.21.34  ( 360s));  the  move towards  the  foundation  of  the  Confederacy  probably  began in  Mantinea  (Larsen  ( 1968)  183;Dusani\u017dc (1970)  285),  and  it was  the  home  town of  the  important  federal  leader Lykomedes  (for  whom  see  Xen.  Hell. 7.1.23\u00ad24,  1.39,  4.2\u00ad3), who  was  one  of  the  two  oecists  that  the  city  supplied  for  the foundation  of  Megalopolis  (no. 282)  (Paus. 8.27.2). Mantinea  was  likewise  a  chief  actor  in  the  crisis  that  led  to the  dismemberment  of  the  Confederacy  in  363  (Xen.  Hell. 7.4.33ff;  Larsen  ( 1968)  189;  Roy ( 1971a)  588).  After  the Confederacy  split  up,  Mantinea  seems,  like  Megalopolis,  to have  been  the  leading  city  of  a  continued  but  smaller Confederacy  (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 290;Diod.  15.94.1\u00ad3  (r 361), 16.39.1\u00ad3  (r 352);  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 337,  342;  cf.  Nielsen  ( 1996b) 356\u00ad59). According  to  Strabo  8.3.2,Mantinea  was  originally  synoe- cised  from  five demoi  (termed  komai  at  Diod. 15.5.4;  cf. Ephor.  fr. 79).At  Xen.  Hell. 5.2.7,it  is  stated  that  settlement  in (four)  komai  was  the  old  way  of  the  Mantineans,  given  up  by 385;  but  the  dioikismos  that  year  meant  a  return  to  this  settle- ment  pattern,  and  the  implication  is  that  the  original  synoe- cism  was  the  reverse  process.  The  synoecism  cannot  be dated  (Hodkinson  and  Hodkinson  ( 1981)  257\u00ad61).In  385,the Spartans  undid  the  synoecism  by  dioikismos,  described  in our  sources  by  the  terms  (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.7;Isoc.De Pace 100;Ephor.  fr. 79.2;Polyb.  4.27.6), \u00b5  (Diod. 15.12.2)  and     (Isoc.  Paneg. 126).  However, in 370  the  city  was  synoecised  again  (Xen.  Hell. 6.5.3\u00ad5). Mantinean  military  activity  is  attested  by,  e.g.,  Hdt. 7.202 and  Thuc. 5.69.1;  commanders  are  mentioned  at  Hdt. 7.203 and  Thuc. 5.69.1.Ephor.fr.54  implies  that  public  instruction in  fighting under arms was g iven  at  Mantinea  from  an  early date;  B\u00f6lte  ( 1930)  1317  assumes  that  this  institution  was inspired  by  Sparta.  Bacchyl.  Ep.fr. 1.2\u00ad3  with  schol.  Pind.  Ol. 10.83a  suggest  that  Mantinean  hoplites  carried  the  trident  of Poseidon  as  a  blazon  (Anderson  ( 1970)  18). The  military  leaders  who  were  late  for  Plataiai  were  exiled (Hdt. 9.77.2);  in  IG v.2261.18  IPArk  no. 7  (C 5m)  there  is  a reference  to ,  and  in  connection  with  the  dioik- ismos 60  \u00b5  went  into  exile  (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.6).  Reception  of  an  embassy  is  implied  by  Hdt. 4.161.2 (rC 6m),  and  Thuc. 5.44.2  mentions  the  sending  of  an embassy. According  to  Thuc. 5.29.1  and  Xen.  Hell. 5.2.7,  Mantinea was  a  democracy,  and  according  to  Arist.  Pol. 1318b27  it  had been  a  democracy  of  the  old,  moderate  type  in  which  offi- cials  were  appointed  by  electors  chosen  by  election  from  all citizens  and  serving  in  rotation  (Larsen  ( 1950)).  Political decision  making,  on  the  other  hand,  was  left  to  the  demos in  assembly  (cf.  Xen.  Hell. 6.5.4\u00ad5).  This  old  type  of  demo- cracy  corresponds  to  a  C 4  politeia  (Arist.  Pol. 1297b24\u00ad5)in the  sense  of  \"citizen  constitution\",  and  Mantinea  is  in  fact described  as  a in  this  sense  by  Isoc.  Paneg. 4.125\u00ad26  (r 385).  Robinson  ( 1997)  113\u00ad14  believes  that Mantinea  was  a  democracy  already  by  C 6,  and  Waisglas ( 1956)  argues  for  the  C 6m  existence  at  Mantinea  of  an  elec- tive  office  of .  During  the  dioikismos,  the  constitu- tion  was  aristocratic  (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.7).  In  connection  with the  dioikismos  there  is  evidence  of  a  sharp  divide  within  the citizenry  between  on  the  one  side and  \u00b5  and  on  the  other  (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.6). The  earliest  surviving  public  enactments  are  a  fragmen- tary  law  (IG v.2  261  IPArk  no. 7  (C 5m))  and  the  treaties recorded  at  Thuc. 5.47  and  SEG 37  340  (C 4f).  IG v.2 262  IPArk  no. 8  (C 5m)  records  a  verdict  and  refers  to at  l. 19.Ael.  VH 2.23  (rC 5s)  mentions  a \u00b5,  and  in  SEG 37  340.6  (C 4f) there  is  a  general  ref- erence  to \u00b5    as  well  as  a  reference  to procedural  laws  (ll. 11\u00ad12). A  council  is  attested  by  Thuc. 5.47.9  (cf.  IG v.2289  (C 4), for  );  it  possibly  had  300  members  (SEG 37 340.24  (C 4f)).  The  eponymous  official was a  \u00b5 (SEG 37  340.20  (C 4f))  who  probably  headed  a  board  (Thuc. 5.47.9).  Boards  of \u00b5  (IG v.2261.7  (C 5m)),  (Thuc. 5.47.9), \u00b5  (Thuc. 5.47.9),  (SEG 37  340.18  (C 4f))  and  \u00b5  (SEG 37  340.20)  are attested  as  well.  For  the  assembly,  see  Xen.  Hell. 6.5.4\u00ad5.A system  of  five phylai  is  attested,  but  its  function  is  unknown (IG v.2271  (C 4m);  Jones,  POAG 132\u00ad35). arkadia  519 The  city  of  Mantinea  was  situated  on  level  ground  and had  no  acropolis.  The  town  had  two  periods  of  existence: down to the  dioikismos  in 385,  and  from  the  new  synoecism in 370.  The  first t own  was  fortified (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.1),  but  the wall  was  pulled  down  at  the  dioikismos  when  the  site  was abandoned  (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.7).  In  370  it  was  decided  to  refor- tify  (and  obviously  reoccupy)  the  town  (Xen.  Hell. 6.5.3). The  preserved  wall,  though  probably  following  the  course  of the  pre- 385  wall  (Hodkinson  and  Hodkinson  ( 1981)  257\u00ad58), is  the  one  built  in  370  (though  it  has  been  thought  to  incor- porate  parts  of  the  earlier  wall  (Scranton  ( 1941)  57ff)).  It encloses  an  area  of 124  ha  (Hodkinson  and  Hodkinson ( 1981)  256)  and  runs  for  3,942  m  with  ten  gates  and  126  tow- ers;  it  was  constructed  in  mudbrick  on  a  stone  foundation (Winter  ( 1989)  191).  Not  much  is  known  about  the  degree  of urbanisation  reached  by  the  pre- 385  city;  archaeology  does not  reveal  much,  and  the  best  information  comes,  in  fact, from  the  written  sources.  From  Thuc. 5.47.11  it  appears  that it  had  an  agora  with  a  sanctuary  of  Zeus;  from  SEG 37  340  it appears  that  there  was  a  boleion  (for  which  see  Winter  ( 1987) 240\u00ad41),  and  Xen.  Hell. 5.2.1\u00ad7  refers  to houses.  But  even  the post- 370  city  is  imperfectly  known,  since  the  excavations have  been  directed  primarily  towards  the  area  of  the  agora, which  was  laid  out  on  the  site  of  the  old  agora  (Winter  ( 1987) 240).  Here  several  stoas  have  been  found,  one  of  which  may be  a  relic  of  the  first t own  (ibid. 239\u00ad40).West  of  the  agora  is a  C 4  theatre  (ibid. 240;  cf.  TGR  ii. 313)  with  an  artificial embankment  (Dilke  ( 1950)  45\u00ad46).  Near  the  theatre  are  sev- eral  Classical  temples  (Jost  ( 1985)  130\u00ad31).  The  \"vast  private sector\"  of  the  city  is  completely  unknown  (Hodkinson  and Hodkinson  ( 1981)  259),  but  at  Hell. 7.5.15  Xenophon  refers  to houses  in  the  second  city  too. The  rich  pantheon  of  Mantinea  is  discussed  by  Jost  ( 1985) 124\u00ad42.The  patron  divinity  was  Poseidon  Hippios,  in  whose honour  festivals  were  celebrated  (Jost  ( 1985)  133,  290). According  to  Xen.  Hell. 5.2.1,  the  Spartans  in  386/5  accused the  Mantineans  of  manipulating  to  avoid  cam- paigning.  C 5  communal  consultation  of  the  Delphic  oracle is  suggested  by  Paus. 8.36.8  (Hejnic  ( 1961)  29). Several  C 5  Olympic  victors  are  on  record  (Olympionikai 163,  193,  202,  254,  256,  265);  spoils  were  dedicated  at  Delphi c. 423  (Thuc. 4.134.2),  and  a  C 5  dedication  in  Olympia  is mentioned  at  Paus. 5.26.6  (a  wingless  Nike  by  Kalamis,  for whom  see  Pollitt  ( 1990)  46). Mantinea  struck  silver  coins  from  c. 500  to 385,  and  silver and  bronze  from  370  onwards.  Denominations:  tritetarte- morion,  hemiobol,  obol,  trihemiobol,  triobol  and  drachm.

The  toponym  is  ,  (CID ii  5.i.24  ( 358)),  or     in Attic  (Dem. 16.4);  the  form  is  late  but  occurs, e.g.,  at  Strabo  8.4.5.  The  city-ethnic  is   (CID ii  4.iii.50  ( 360))  or  in  Attic  (IG ii\u00b2 161.2  (C 4m)). Megalopolis  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Dem. 16.25  and  Syll. \u00b3  559.29  (r 371\u00ad368),  and  it  is  listed  (as ) as a polis  in  the  political  sense  in  the accounts  of  the  Delphic  naopoioi  at  CID ii  4.iii.1,  50  ( 360) under  the  heading          ; Diod. 18.70.1  (r 318)  refers  to the  .  The  territorial sense  of  polis  (with  the  political  sense  as  a  possible  connota- tion)  occurs  in  Xen.  Hell. 7.5.5  (for  which  see  Nielsen  ( 1996c) 72\u00ad73).  The  collective  use  of  the  ethnic  is  attested  externally in,  e.g.,  CID ii  4.iii.50  ( 360)  and  Isoc. 5.97;  the  individual  use is  attested  externally  in  CID ii  4.iii.55\u00ad56  ( 360). Megalopolis  was  a  creation  of  the  Arkadian  Confederacy and  was  synoecised  by  a  board  of  ten  oikistai,  two each from Mantinea  (no. 281),  Tegea  (no. 297),  Kleitor  (no. 276),  the Mainalians  and  the  Parrhasians  (Paus. 8.27.2).  The  synoe- cism  is  known  principally  from  Diod. 15.72.4,  who  gives  a compressed  account  of  an  event  and  dates  the  synoecism  to 368;  and  from  Paus. 8.27.1\u00ad8,  who  gives  a  detailed  account  of the  original  plan  for  the  foundation  as  well  as  an  account  of the  implementation  of  this  plan,  and  dates  the  synoecism  to shortly  after  Leuktra.  The  two  accounts  are,  apparently, irreconcilable,  and  it  has  been  customary  to  follow  one  and reject  the  other;  however,  the  differences  concern  chiefly the date  and  the  extent  of  the  synoecism,  and  the  difficulties may  be  at  least  partly  removed  by  the  realisation  that Pausanias'  account  is  primarily  prescriptive,  whereas  that  of Diodoros  is  descriptive:  thus,  the  decision  to  synoecise  may have  been  taken  shortly  after  Leuktra  (Paus.)  but  the  imple- mentation  may  have  been  postponed  to  368  (Diod.).  The real  problem,  however,  is  the  extent  of  the  synoecism. According  to Diod. 15.72.4,  the  city  was  created  by  a  synoe- cism  whereby  twenty  komai  belonging  to  the  Parrhasians 520 nielsen and  Mainalians  were  relocated  to  a  new  site  (accepted  by, e.g.,  Moggi  ( 1974)  and  Demand  ( 1990)  113);  according  to Paus. 8.27.3\u00ad4,  the  synoecism  was  planned  as  a  much larger enterprise,  which  was  to absorb  thirty-nine  different  poleis, among  them  some  former  Lakedaimonian  perioikic  com- munities.  However,  Pausanias  himself  goes  on  to  explain that  the  decision  was  not  implemented  exactly  as  planned ( 8.27.5\u00ad8).  So,  although  by  the  Roman  period  Megalopolis seems  to  have  controlled  all  the  sites  listed  by  Pausanias  (Roy et al.( 1988)  180),  it  is  not  safe  to  assume  that  the  synoecism originally  had  the  extent  implied  by  his  list.  What  happened in 368  was  thus  a  synoecism  of  smaller  dimensions  than originally  envisaged,  and  the  synoecism  may  primarily  have involved  Parrhasian  and  Mainalian  communities  (Diod.), though  Eutresian  communities  are  likely  to  have  been involved  as  well  (cf.  Paus. 8.27.5,  stating  that  Eutresian Trikolonoi  unsuccessfully  resisted  incorporation).  As  in many  other  cases,  the  synoecism  was  probably  planned,  and certainly  carried  out,  as  a  relocation  of  only  a  part  of  the population  of  the  settlements  concerned  (Roy  ( 1968)  159). Among  the  communities  situated  in  Megalopolitan  territo- ry,  at  least  Lykosoura  (no. 280)  seems  to  have  survived  as  a dependent  polis,  and  there  may  have  been  some  others  (Roy ( 2000a)  139). The  ancient  sources  (Paus. 8.27;Diod.  15.72.4)  agree  that Megalopolis  was  intended  to  serve  as  protection  against Sparta  (no. 345).  For  a  modern  but  highly  speculative  dis- cussion  of  the  ideology  behind  the  foundation,  see  Braunert and  Petersen  ( 1972).  In  361  the  city  suffered  a  serious  crisis  as some  of  the  relocated  populations  left  for  their  old  settle- ments  and  called  upon  Mantinea  for  support;  the  rebellion was,  however,  overcome  with  Theban  assistance  (Diod. 15.94.1);  nor  did  the  Spartans  succeed  in  a  dioikismos  of  the city  in  352  (Dem. 16.30;Diod.  16.39). If  the  territory  comprised  all  the  communities  listed  at Paus. 8.27.3\u00ad4,  it  will  have occupied  1,500  km \u00b2  (Roy  et al. ( 1988)  179).  If,  however,  the  reconstruction  of  Moggi  ( 1974), based  on  Diodoros,  is  preferred,  the  territory will  have measured  c. 400  km \u00b2,somewhat  larger  than  that  of  Tegea  but smaller  than  that  of  Kleitor.  A  survey  has  been  carried  out  in the  territory;  from  the  preliminary  reports  it  appears  that even  after  the  synoecism  there  was  considerable  habitation in  the  rural  areas,  both  in  dispersed  farmsteads  and  in nucleated  settlements  (Roy  et al.( 1992)).  Almost  all  other information  about  the  territory  comes  from  the  late  account of  Pausanias,  which  is  discussed  in  detail  by  Jost  ( 1973). There  is  no  good  evidence  relating  to  the  size  of  the  popu- lation;  for  what  it  is  worth,  Diod. 18.70.1  states  that  in  318  the city  managed  to  put  15,000  men  under  arms,  but  this  figure includes  metics  and  slaves  (Bury  ( 1898)  16);  Gardner  et al. ( 1893)  3  supposes  a  total  population  of 65,000. Megalopolis  was  a  federal  foundation,  and  the  city  was,  of course,  a  member  of  the  Arkadian  Confederacy  (IG v.21.23 ( 360s)).It  is  often  believed  that  the  city  was  intended  to  serve as  the  capital  of  the  Confederacy  (Bury  ( 1898);  Braunert  and Petersen ( 1972)  81ff).  Certainly,  the  fact  that  the  city  provid- ed  ten  damiorgoi  for  the  Confederacy,  whereas  Tegea  (no. 297)  and  Mantinea  provided  only  five each ( IG v.21.1,  23,  34 ( 360s)),  suggests  that  the  city  did  somehow  enjoy  a  favoured position  within  the  Confederacy,  but  greater  precision  on this  point  is  impossible  (Roy  ( 2000b);  Tsiolis  ( 1995)  51,  54). When  the  Confederacy  split  in  363,  Megalopolis  sided  with Tegea  and  Boiotia  against  Mantinea,  Athens  (no. 361)  and Sparta.  According  to  Polyb. 4.33.9,  after  the  battle  of Mantinea  in  362,  Megalopolis  was  the  centre  of  an  Arkadian alliance:         \u00b5\u00b5 .  This  presumably means  that  the  city  posed  as  the  leader  of  one  faction  of  the Confederacy;  at  least,  we know  that  the  federal  assembly, Myrioi,  held  a  session  in  Megalopolis  in  348/7  (Dem. 19.10; Aeschin. 2.157);  since  there  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  the Confederacy  had  reunited  by  this  date  (cf.  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 337 ( 342)),  this  probably  means  that  Megalopolis  claimed  to represent  the  Arkadian  Confederacy;  but  Mantinea  proba- bly  did  so  as  well;  see  Nielsen  ( 1996b)  356\u00ad59  for  further  dis- cussion. From  Dem. 16.28  it  appears  that  in  the  350s  Megalopolis was  allied  to Thebes  (no. 221);  from  Diod. 16.39  it  is  clear  that the  city  had  alliances  with  Argos  (no. 347),  Sikyon  (no. 228), Messene  (no. 318)  and  Orneai  (no. 354)  as  well. Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 337  attests  to  an  alliance  with  Athens  in  342. Xen.  Hell. 7.5.5  refers  to  Megalopolitan  troops.  Diod. 18.56.5  (r 318)  refers  to exiles  from  the  city.  Dem. 16.1  refers  to the  sending  of  an  embassy,  and  Dem. 19.10,  Aeschin. 2.157 and  SEG 20  716.20  (C 4)  to reception  of  embassies.  Two  cit- izens  were  appointed  Athenian  proxenoi  in  C 4m  (IG ii\u00b2  161), and  another  received  Delphic  proxenia  in  the  330s  (I.Delphes iii.4380\u00ad81).  An  Epidaurian  theorodokos  resided  in  the  city in  C 4l\u00adC3e  (IAEpid 42.3). Being  a  federal  foundation,  Megalopolis  was  probably originally  a  democracy,  since  the  Confederacy  was  demo- cratic  (Larsen  ( 1968)  180).  The  earliest  reference  to  a  public enactment  is  Diod. 18.70.1  (r 318):    ... ;  IG v.2431.3  (C 4)  has  been  restored  to  refer  to  a council.  A  board  of  damiorgoi  is  referred  to in  IG v.2431.2; the  office of  agonothetes  is  attested  by  IG  V. 2450  (C 4s).  It  is arkadia  521 as  good  as  certain  that  a  system  of  six  phylai  was  created  at the  foundation  of  the  city,  but  on  its  functions  we  have  no information  (IG v.2451  (C 3l\u00adC2e)  and  468  (C 4\u00adC3)  with Jones,  POAG 135\u00ad38). The  public  architecture  included  a  bouleuterion  (Paus. 8.30.9,  without  indication  of  its  date;  cf.  Hansen  and Fischer-Hansen  ( 1994)  40),  a  stoa  erected  by  Philip  II  of Makedon  (Paus. 8.30.6;  cf.  Gardner  et al.( 1893)  59\u00ad66  and AR  ( 1993\u00ad94)  17\u00ad18,(1994\u00ad95)  13);  in  addition,  Paus. 8.30.7 has  a  reference  to  unspecified  .  In  the  agora  (for which  see  Gardner  et al.( 1893)  101\u00ad6)  there  was  a  sanctuary with  a  temple  of  Zeus  Soter  (C 4)  (cf.  AR  ( 1993\u00ad94)  17).  The theatre  had  a  seating  capacity  of  c. 20,000  (Gardner  et al. ( 1893)  42;  TGR  ii. 262\u00ad63)  and  was  built  when  the  city  was founded  (Gardner  et al.( 1893)  69,  75;  cf.  AR  ( 2001\u00ad2)  28). Finally,  the  city  housed  a  C 4m  assembly  hall  which  served the  Confederacy  (Paus. 8.32.1;  cf.  Gardner  et al.( 1893)  17\u00ad23) as  well  as  the  city  itself  (Tsiolis  ( 1995)  51\u00ad54).  So  the  city  was able  to house  federal  institutions,  and  a  federal  assembly met  in  the  city  in  348/7  (Dem. 19.10;  Aeschin. 2.165);  it  is unknown,  however,  whether  the  assembly  met  in  the  city  in the 360s;  Harp.  s.v.  Myrioi  states:       ...  \u00b5\u00b5    ,  but  this  need  not refer  to  meetings  in  the  360s  (cf.  Dem. 19.10;  Aeschin. 2.165). None  the  less,  Braunert  and  Petersen  ( 1972)  81  believe  that the  city  was  planned  as  the  capital  of  the  Confederacy. The  city  wall  of  Megalopolis  was  erected  when  the  city was  founded  and  was  c. 9  km  long  (Loring  in  Gardner  et al. ( 1893)  115);  it  withstood  a  siege  during  the  revolt  of  Agis (Aeschin. 3.165)  in  331,but  in 318  certain  sections  had  to be repaired  (Diod. 18.70.2).  It  was  a  mudbrick  wall  on  a  stone foundation  (ibid.).  The  area  enclosed  by  walls  measured c. 350  ha;  this  area,  however,  includes  the  river  Helisson, which  divided  the  city  in  two.  Since  the  excavations  have been  directed  exclusively  at  the  agora  and  the  theatre,  there is  no  way  of  knowing  how  densely  populated  this  large  area was;  it  is  usually  assumed  that  the  city  was  much  too  large  for its  population  (Gardner  et al.( 1893)  116).  This  was  certainly the  case  in  C 3l  (Polyb. 2.55.2,  5.93.5);  however,  as  Moggi ( 1974)  105\u00ad7  has  argued,  the  extreme  lack  of  population  in C 3l  was  probably  due  to  exceptional  circumstances.  In  any case,  a  drop  in  population  is  normally  assumed  for  C 3 Arkadia  in  general  (Sallares  ( 1991)  106),and  so  it  is  problem- atical  to  use  the  evidence  about  the  C 3  level  of  population retrospectively  for  C 4.  Even  on  the  most  cautious  esti- mate--that only  100  ha  was  occupied  by  habitation  and  that each  ha  accommodated  only  100  people--the urban popu- lation  of  the  city  would  have  been  10,000. Free  non-citizens, ,  are referred to by Diod. 18.70.1 (r 318).  The  patron  deity  was  either  Athena  Polias  (Paus. 8.31.9;  Jost  ( 1985)  230)  or  Zeus  Lykaios  (Brackertz  ( 1976) 85\u00ad87).  In  general,  the  Megalopolitan  pantheon  reflects the fact  that  the  city  was  founded  by  synoecism  of  pre-existing states:  in  the  city  are  found  several  doublets  of  cults  that belonged  to  the  communities  from  which  the  city  was  syn- oecised  (Nilsson  ( 1951)  18\u00ad22;  Jost  ( 1985)  221\u00ad33,(1994) 225\u00ad28).  Most  importantly,  there  was  a  peribolos  of  Zeus Lykaios  in  the  agora.  Cf.  Jost  ( 1996). In C 4m  Megalopolis  applied  to  the  Amphiktyonic  League for  membership  (Syll. \u00b3224). During  the  360s  and  later,  Megalopolis  struck  staters  with obv.  Pan;  rev.  Zeus  Lykaios;  legend: in  monogram (Head,  HN \u00b2445).  A  series  of  triobols  and  obols  with  similar types  and  legends  may  belong  to  C 4l  (Head,  HN \u00b2445; Warren ( 1969)  39;  SNG  Cop.  Argolis 191\u00ad200).  In  addition, bronze  coins  with  similar  types  and  legends  were  struck (Head,  HN \u00b2445;  SNG  Cop.  Argolis 201\u00ad10);  SNG  Cop.  Argolis 208  shows  Athena  and  Pan. 283.

However,  since  there  is  a  C 4  occurrence  of the  city-ethnic  in  the  external  individual  use  (Aristox.  fr. 135, Wehrli),  the  city  must  have  existed  in  the  Classical  period and  was  possibly  a  polis  (Nielsen  ( 1996a)  131\u00ad32),  as  it  cer- tainly  was  in  C 3  (see,  e.g.,  the  description  of  a  stasis  given by Polyb. 4.17\u00ad18  and 9.17). The  name  of  the  territory  is  unknown;  at  4.17.5,  Polybios terms  it  .  It  occupied  c. 125  km \u00b2.  There  are  no  important remains  in  the  territory  (Jost  ( 1985)  53),  and  the  major  part of  the  city  itself  is  probably  hidden  beneath  modern Kalavryta  (Meyer  ( 1939a)  107  and  Howell  ( 1970)  96;  but  see Petropoulos  ( 1985)  65\u00ad66). 279.

The  treaty  IPArk  no. 15.2  describes  itself  as  an  agreement  of and  provides  for  the  inclusion  of  the  Euaiminians into  the  Orchomenian  citizen  body  (IPArk  p. 135);  however, Euaimon  probably  continued  to  exist  (cf.  Steph.  Byz. 283.14\u00ad15;Dusani\u017dc (1978)  338;  Nielsen  ( 1996c)  71),  and  may thereafter  have  been  a  dependent  polis  of  Orchomenos. In IPArk  no. 15.6\u00ad7,          \u00b5  is presumably  a  reference  to communal  cults  in  Euaimon which  were  to  be  preserved  after  the  agreement,  but  the  local pantheon  is  otherwise  unknown  (Jost  ( 1985)  115,  120). 270.

The  city-ethnic  is invariably  (Hecat.  fr. 6).  Psophis  is  called  polis  in the  political  sense  in  IvO 294  (C 4s;see  comm.  IvO  and  Meyer ( 1959)  1426),  and  in  the  urban  sense  at  Polyb. 4.70.4  (r 219). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on C 5  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2  453)  and  externally  in  SEG 24  299  (C 6s) and  at  Hecat.  fr. 6. The  territory occupied  c. 280  km \u00b2.  No  second-order  set- tlements  are  known.  The  mountains  Malea  and  Lampeia were  sacred  to  Pan  (Jost  ( 1985)  57).  On  Mt.  Aphrodision  was a  sanctuary  with  several  buildings,  among  which  a  C 5  tem- ple  ( 9.9 7.4  m)  and  a  C 5  stoa  stand  out;  the  votives  date back  to  the  Archaic  period  (Jost  ( 1985)  58\u00ad59).  According  to Paus. 8.25.1,  the  border  with  Thelphousa  (no. 300)  was marked  by  a  stele  with   \u00b5\u00b5. Psophis  is  not  attested  as  having  been  a  member  of  any larger  organisation  during  our  period,  but  according  to Polyb. 4.70.3,  it  was  an  Azanian  community;  however,  if  the Azanians  ever  formed  a  political  unit,  this  had  broken  up before  C 5  (Roy  ( 1972b)  44,(1996)  110;  Nielsen  ( 1996a)  138). Paus. 5.24.2  refers  to  undatable  military  activities  by Psophis;  however,  SEG 24  299  is  a  C 6s  dedication  of  a  shield by  the  city  at  Olympia,  indicating  that  it  was  conducting military  campaigns  by  that  time. No  Psophidian  proxenoi  are  known,  but  at  6.16.7 Pausanias  refers  to  an  (undatable)  sculptural  group  at Olympia  which  he  thought  represented  Eleian  proxenoi  of Psophis. Psophis  was  situated  in  a  remarkable,  almost  peninsular position  between  the  rivers  Erymanthos  and  Aroanios  (see Jost  ( 1985)  pl. 10.1),  a  position  commented  upon  by  Polyb. 4.70.7\u00ad10  and  well  brought  out  by  Pritchett  ( 1989)  23\u00ad24.For what  it  is  worth,  Polybios  at  4.70.3  calls  the  city  a    \u00b5.For Archaic stray finds from the site,see Jost  ( 1985)  57.  Several  sections  of  retaining  walls  can  be found  inside  the  circuit  (Papandreou  ( 1920)  138).Within  the circuit  are  numerous  ancient  remains  and  sherds  (ibid. 138\u00ad41);  some  of  the  larger  foundations  may  be  of  temples (cf.  Jost  ( 1985)  55\u00ad57),  and  there  are  traces  of  a  proasteion  as well  (Papandreou  ( 1920)  142).  The  circuit  wall  enclosed  an area  of 80  ha  (Meyer  ( 1959)  1424).  It is  of  Scranton's class  C 5 (isodomic  trapezoidal:  quarry  face,  p. 170),  which  he  dates 425\u00ad375  (Scranton  ( 1941)  85).  Polybios  refers  to private houses  in  Psophis  three  times  ( 4.72.1  twice  ( ),  8 ( )).  The  acropolis,  too,  is  mentioned  by  Polyb. 4.71.11,  72.1  (r 219).  An  acropolis  wall  is  not  visible  (Pritchett ( 1989)  28)  and  there  are  no  ancient  remains  on  the  acropolis (Papandreou  ( 1920)  138). Athena  Polias  is  presumably  attested  on  coin  types  (Jost ( 1985)  55),  and  Papandreou  ( 1920)  139  assumes  that  Artemis Erykine  was  the  patron  divinity  of  the  city. The  coinage  of  Psophis  began  in  C 5f(Head,  HN \u00b2  453). The  Classical  coinage  was  in  silver  only.  Known  denomina- tions  are  tritemorion,  hemiobol,  obol,  trihemiobol  and tetrobol.  The  legend  is  or  abbreviations thereof.  Frequent  types  are  obv.  Keryneian  stag;  rev.  fish (with  acorn)  in  incuse  square,  and  obv.  head  of  Athena;  rev. club  (of  Herakles).  In C 4l  the  city  began  to  strike  in  bronze. SNG  Cop.

Thisoa  is  listed  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  or  political  sense  at Paus. 8.27.4  (r 371),and  refers  to  itself  as  a  polis  in  the  political sense  in  IG v.2510\u00ad11  (C 3l\u00adC2e).  The  ethnic  is  found  in  the external  individual  use  in  SEG 14  455  (C 4f),  for  which  see Roy ( 1972c)  78;  the  internal  collective  use  is  found  in  IG v.2 510\u00ad11  (C 3l\u00adC2e). The  name  and  size  of  the  territory  are  unknown;  Paus. 8.28.3  (       \u00b5) and 8.28.4 (     ) suggest that the toponym could be  used  as  the  name  of  the  territory.  At  Paus. 8.27.3  (r 371) Thisoa  is  listed  among  a  number  of  communities  whose relationship  to  Orchomenos  (no. 286)  could  be  described  by the  expression     .  It  is  not  clear  what  this  means, but  it  suggests  that  prior  to 371  Thisoa  was  a  dependency  of Orchomenos  (Nielsen  ( 1996c)  84\u00ad86). Membership  of  the  Arkadian  Confederacy  can  be inferred  from  Paus. 8.27.4;  the  same  passage  claims  that Thisoa  was  one  of  the  communities  that  the  Arkadian Confederacy  decreed  to  relocate  to  Megalopolis  (no. 282), but  it  is  not  known  whether  the  decision  was  implemented. SEG 14  455  (C 4f)  attests  to  a  Delphic  grant  of  proxenia  to a  Thisoaian;  this  man  could  conceivably  originate  from Kynourian  Thisoa  (for  which  see  Paus. 8.27.3),  but  it  is  more likely  that  he  was  a  citizen  of  the  Thisoa  under  discussion (Roy  ( 1972c)  78). Thisoa  was  located  at  modern  Karkalou.  The  city  proper, unwalled,  lay  below  the  acropolis  on  a  plateau  (Jost  ( 1985) 212).  The  acropolis  was  walled,  but  the  fortification has not been  dated;  it  may  be  C 3  (Jost  ( 1985)  212  n. 1).  Remains  of buildings  have  been  found  both  on  the  acropolis  and  in  the lower  city;  the  oldest  remains  reported  are  C 3  (Prakt ( 1911\u00ad12)  243). 302.

The  territory occupied  c. 125  km \u00b2;  its  mountainous  char- acter  is  well  brought  out  by  Jost  ( 1985)  82\u00ad83.  It  is  termed by IG v.2419  (c. 240)  and  Polyb. 4.3.7.  A  possible inland  port  on  the  river  Neda  is  described  by  Cooper  ( 1972) 359\u00ad62.  On  a  promontory  overlooking  the  Neda  valley  and  with  city  and  port  within  sight  is  a  free-standing  C 4 watch-tower  (ibid. 363).Phigaleia  probably  had  a  number  of second-order  settlements;  one  such,  c. 1  km  west  of  the  city, is  briefly noticed b y  Cooper  and  Myers  ( 1981)  133,who hypothesise  \"a  number  of  satellite  villages\"  (ibid.);  one  such was  associated  with  the  sanctuary  at  Bassai  (Yalouris  ( 1979) 90).  At  Bassai,  on  the  southern  slope  of  Mt.  Kotilion,  the sanctuary  of  Apollo  Bassitas  or  Epikourios  (cf.  Cooper ( 1968)  103  n. 5)  can  be  traced  back  to c.C 8s  or  c. 700  (Jost ( 1985)  93;  Voyatzis  ( 1990)  43).  C. 620\u00ad580  a  monumental temple  was  built  (for  a  plan,  see  Jost  ( 1985)  pl. 22.2;Kelly ( 1995)  fig. 1)  which  was  oriented  north\u00adsouth.  It  is  possible that  the  construction  of  a  new  temple  was  begun  c. 500 (Yalouris  ( 1979)  94\u00ad96;  Jost  ( 1985)  94);  however,  the  famous Classical  temple  was  built  in  C 5s  (Jost  ( 1985)  95).It  is  a  Doric peripteral  temple  measuring  16.13 38.87  m  and  oriented north\u00adsouth,  with  six  times  fifteen c olumns,  and  is  built  of local  limestone  (for  a  plan,  see  Cooper  ( 1968)  104).  A  large number  of  other  Archaic  and  Classical  buildings  stood within  the  sanctuary  (Yalouris  ( 1979)  90).  Just  above  Bassai, on  Mt.  Kotilion,  two  simple  temples  without  peristasis  have been  excavated  (see  Jost  ( 1985)  pl. 22.3  for  a  plan).  They  were presumably  parts  of  a  single  sanctuary  (Jost  ( 1985)  97)  that can  be  traced  back  to  C 8\u00adC7  (ibid.).  The  temples  were  erect- ed  contemporaneously  with  the  first t emple  at  Bassai,  i.e. c. 625\u00ad600  (Cooper  ( 1968)  103  n. 7).  For  other  extra-urban sanctuaries,  see  Cooper  ( 1972)  363\u00ad67  and  AR  ( 1995\u00ad96)  12. K.  Tausend  ( 1993)  16  argues  that  Phigaleia  was  an  Azanian city,  but  this  is  highly  unlikely  (Roy  ( 1972b)  44  n. 6;  Nielsen ( 1996a)  160  n. 61;  Nielsen  and  Roy  ( 1998)  33\u00ad36);  in  any  case, if  the  Azanians  ever  formed  a  political  unit,  this  had  broken up  before  C 5  (Roy  ( 1972b)  44,(1996)  110;  Nielsen  ( 1996a) 138).  Membership  of  the  Peloponnesian  League  is  not explicitly  attested,  but  can  be  assumed  (Nielsen  ( 1996c)  87, 92);  the  same  is  true  of  membership  of  the  Arkadian Confederacy  (ibid. 94\u00ad95).  According  to Polyaen. 6.27.2, Phigaleia  sent  an  embassy  to  Argos  (no. 347)  to  conclude  a symmachia;Meyer ( 1938)  2070,  2082,  believes  that  the  pas- sage  refers  to C 5l;  see,  however,  Robertson  ( 1992)  234\u00ad35, 240,243\u00ad44  and  esp. 250\u00ad52,arguing  that  this  passage  simply reflects an aetiological m ythic  complex.  The  earliest  attested treaty  to  which  Phigaleia  was  a  party  is  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 476  of c. 267\u00ad265,  a  treaty  between  Athens  (no. 361)  and  Sparta  (no. 345)  with  allies.  A  citizen  of  Phigaleia  was  appointed  prox- enos  by  the  Aitolian  Confederacy  c. 270  (IG ix.113.19). Phigaleian  exiles  are  mentioned  by  Diod. 15.40.2  (r 374). From  the  same  passage  it  can  be  inferred  that  Phigaleia  was a  democracy  in  374  (Roy  ( 1973)  138).  A  system  of  phylai  is attested  in  IG v.2421  (undated);  damiorgoi  are  mentioned  in IG v.2423  (undated). The  agora  is  mentioned  in  IG v.2421.7  (undated);  Polyb. 4.79.5  refers  to a  polemarchion;Diod. 15.40.2  (r 374)  mentions a  theatre.A  C 4\u00adC3  fountain  is  found  too  (Papachatzis  ( 1994) 352\u00ad53).  The  acropolis  was  separately  fortified (Cooper and Myers  ( 1981)  fig. 4);  there  are  no  remains  on  the  acropolis (Jost  ( 1985)  86).  \"Fortifications embrace a large area, approximately  1.5  km  north\u00adsouth  and  1.3  km  east\u00adwest\" (Cooper  and  Myers  ( 1981)  124;  a  plan  is  found  as  fig. 4); \"Stretches  of  the  circuit  may  date  as  early  as  the  5th  c.  B.C. but  in  the  mid  4th  c.  B.C.  portions  were  rebuilt\"  (Cooper  in PECS  s.v.  Phigalia).  Meyer  ( 1938)  2069  supposes  that  not  all the  area  of  the  city  was  actually  occupied  by  habitation,  but that  the  city  was  built  to  give  shelter  to  herds  of  cattle;  on  the other  hand,  Cooper  and  Myers  ( 1981)  133  note  that  roof-tiles, some  Classical,  are  scattered  across  most  of  the  site,  indicat- ing  habitation  and/or  other  roofed  buildings.  According  to Cooper  in  PECS  s.v.  Phigalia,  \"considerable  remains  of  the Archaic,  Classical,  and  Roman  periods  lie  exposed\".  For  a  C 4 intra-mural  temple  of  Zeus  Soter  and  Athena,  see  AR ( 1996\u00ad97)  47. A  Polias  divinity  is  attested  by  IG v.2421  (undated).  The principal  deity  of  the  city  was  Dionysos  (Meyer  ( 1938) 2083\u00ad84),  in  whose  honour  festivals  (Diod. 15.40.2  (r 374)) and  mysteries  (Jost  ( 1985)  85  with  refs.)  were  celebrated; recently,  a  C 4  intramural  temple  dedicated  to  Athena  and Zeus  Soter  has  been  excavated;  at  the  temple  a  number  of inscriptions  were  found,  among  which  grants  of  proxenia  to citizens  of  Megalopolis  (no. 282)  and  Byzantion  (no. 674), etc.,  and  an  Archaic  votive  inscription  to  Athena  (Ergon ( 1996)  41\u00ad47).  SEG 23  240  is  a  C 4  dedication  to  Hygieia. Citizens  of  Phigaleia  achieved  Olympic  victories  in  C 6 (Olympionikai 95,  99,  102)  and  C 4  (Olympionikai 392);  the latter  athlete  won  three  Isthmian  victories  as  well  (CEG ii 826).The  city  as  such  donated  money  for  the  construction  of the  new  temple  at  Delphi  in  the  360s  (CID ii  4.iii.45). 293.

Nonakris).  Its  name  was  (Polyb. 4.68.1)  or     (Paus. 8.14.5);  Theophr.  fr. 160,  Wimmer, suggests  that  the  toponym  could  designate  the  territory  as well.  The  territory  is  termed  by Theophr.  Hist.  pl. 3.1.2,  5.4.6.  It  must  have suffered  from  severe problems  of drainage  (Strabo  8.8.4;  Baker-Penoyre  ( 1902);  Knauss ( 1990)).  Stangl  ( 1999a),  ( 1999b),  estimates  that  the  territory could  support  max. 5,000  individuals.  In  addition  to Nonakris  and  Pheneos  itself,  the  territory  included  Lykouria c. 4  km  south-west  of  Pheneos,  a  site  that  seems  to  have  been a  substantial  village  (Knauss  ( 1990)  50\u00ad51;  cf.  K.  Tausend ( 1999c)).  For  Classical  watch-towers,  see  K.  Tausend  and Erath  ( 1997)  2;  K.  Tausend  ( 1999b)  308\u00ad12.  Three  extra- urban  sanctuaries  are  archaeologically  attested  (K.  Tausend and  Erath  ( 1997);  Erath  ( 1999b)). Pheneos  was  an  Azanian  community  (Steph.  Byz. 662.6); however,  if  the  Azanians  ever  formed  a  political  unit,  this had  broken  up  before  C 5  (Roy  ( 1972b)  44,(1996)  110;  Nielsen ( 1996a)  138). C. 330  an  Argive  theorodokos  resided  in  Pheneos,  and  c. 300 (SEG 23  189.23)  one  of  its  citizens  was  granted  Argive  proxe- nia  (SEG 30  356). In  Pheneos  only  the  sanctuary  of  Asklepios  in  the  lower city  has  been  excavated  (Jost  ( 1985)  29\u00ad30).  It  was  a  city  with a  habitation  area  beneath  a  fortified acropolis.  The  earliest part  of  the  acropolis  wall  dates  to  C 4  (B\u00f6lte  ( 1938)  1970;  Jost ( 1985)  31);  good  C 5  sherds  have  been  found  at  the  site (Simpson  and  Lazenby  ( 1970)  91).  A  recent  survey  suggests that  the  urban  centre  occupied  c. 20  ha  (Stangl  ( 1999b)  178). The  principal  deity  of  Pheneos  was  Hermes  (Paus. 8.14.10; B\u00f6lte  ( 1938)  1972\u00ad73;  cf.  Jost  ( 1985)  27\u00ad37),  in  whose  honour games  were  celebrated  (schol.  Pind.  Ol. 7.153a).A  festival  with games  in  honour  of  the  Dioskouroi  is  attested  by  SEG 39  1365 ( 470\u00ad450).  Before  460,  Pheneos  set  up  a  statue  of  Hermes  in Olympia  (Paus. 5.27.8);  it  was  made  by  Onatas  (for  whom  see Pollitt  ( 1990)  36\u00ad39).  Neolaidas  of  Pheneos  won  the  boys' boxing  contest  at  Olympia  c. 392  (Olympionikai 380). The  coinage  of  Pheneos  begins  C 5l  ( 421,  according  to both  Head,  HN \u00b2452  and  Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 3.  598).  The  leg- ends  are: ,  ,  .  The  city  struck  in both  silver  (SNG  Cop.  Argolis 271\u00ad73)  and  bronze  (SNG  Cop. Argolis 274\u00ad77).  Known  denominations  are  hemiobol,  obol, triobol,  drachm  and  stater.  The  most  commonly  depicted divinities  are  Demeter  and  Hermes.  The  magnificent C 4 staters  depict  Demeter  (Maia?)  on  the  obv.;  rev.  Hermes  run- ning  with  the  infant  Arkas,  to  which  is  sometimes  added  the legend .  The  staters  are  collected  and  described  by Schultz  ( 1991),  who  dates  them  to  360\u00ad340. 292.

For  a  discus- sion  of  onomastics,  see  Meyer  ( 1939c)  1014\u00ad15. Oresthasion  is  called  a  polis  by  Pherekydes  (FGrHist 3)  fr. 135a  and  by  Eur.  El. 1273\u00ad75,  in  both  cases  presumably  in  the urban  sense;  Paus. 8.27.3  (r 371)  retrospectively  lists  it  as  a polis.  The  external  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found in  IvO 147.148  (C 5f)  and  SEG 20  716.23  (C 4m). The  name  of  the  territory  was  '  (Thuc. 4.134.1); its  size  is  unknown.  In  423  a  battle  was  fought  in  the  territory between  the  Tegean  and  Mantinean  Leagues  (for  which  see Nielsen  ( 1996c)  79\u00ad86)  at  a  place  called  (Thuc. 4.134.1). Oresthasion  was  a  Mainalian  city  (Paus. 8.27.3;  Nielsen ( 1996a)  132\u00ad34).  The  city  seems  to  have  been  an  important centre  for  assembling  Peloponnesian  League  troops  (Hdt. 9.11.2;  Thuc. 5.64.3;  Pikoulas  ( 1988)  109\u00ad10,  205\u00ad11); membership  of  the  League  may  thus  be  assumed,  but  it  was probably  via  the  Mainalian  tribal  state  (Nielsen  ( 1996c) 100\u00ad1).  Membership  of  the  Arkadian  Confederacy  can  be inferred  from  Paus. 8.27.3,  and  was  probably  again  via  the Mainalian  tribe. According  to  Paus. 8.27.3,  Oresthasion  was  one  of  the communities  that  the  Arkadian  Confederacy  voted  to  relo- cate  to  Megalopolis  (no. 282).  It  is  likely  that  the  city  came under  Megalopolitan  control,  but  it  was  probably  not  aban- doned  since  a  surface  survey  has  brought  to  light  numerous Hellenistic  sherds  at  the  probable  site  of  the  city,  see Pikoulas  ( 1988)  102\u00ad4. According  to  Pikoulas  ( 1988)  102,  the  hill  of  Groumourou at  Anemodhouri,  rising  to  70  m,  was  an  ideal  acropolis  for the  site  at  Anemodhouri  (  Oresthasion).  The  hill-top measures  44  30  m;  it  has  yielded  sherds  and  remains  of  a pre-Classical  fortification wall (Pikoulas ( 1988)  104). According  to  Pikoulas  ( 1988)  102,  the  megalos  archaios  oik- ismos  of  Oresthasion  covered  an  area  of 450 200  m.  The area  is  filled w ith  sherds  spanning  the  Archaic  to  Hellenistic periods,  and  column  drums  lie  exposed  (ibid.).  No  remains of  fortifications of  the  lower  city  are  visible. In C 5f,  in  472  according  to Olympionikai 231,  a citizen  of Oresthasion  won  an  Olympic  victory  (IvO 147.148). 288.Paion  Map 58.  Lat. 37.55,long.  22.00.  Size  of  territo- ry:  ?

The  city  is  called  polis  at  Hdt. 6.127.3,  and  in  the  same  pas- sage is implicitly used about it (cf.Hdt.6.126.3,127.3). C. 230\u00ad210  a  Delphic  theorodokos  resided  in  the  city  (BCH 45 ( 1921)  ii.72). Paion  was  an  Azanian  community  (Hdt. 6.127.3);  howev- er,  if  the  Azanians  ever  formed  a  political  unit,  this  had  bro- ken  up  before  C 5  (Roy  ( 1972b)  44,(1996)  110;  Nielsen  ( 1996a) 138). Paion  was  situated  at  modern  Skoupi.  The  acropolis  was constituted  by  a  small,  separately  fortified plateau measur- ing 34 65  m  (Meyer  ( 1942)  2399).  Here  Papandreou arkadia  525 believed  he  saw  the  foundations  of  a  temple  and  another building  (Prakt  ( 1920)  125). The  city  wall  did  not  enclose  the  whole  city,  but  just  the upper  city  (Meyer  ( 1942)  2399).  It  was  516  m  long  and  possi- bly  dates  to C 4  (ibid.).  A  large  cistern  ( 11 8  m)  was  built into  the  city  wall  (ibid.). The  extent  of  the  city  is  not  stated  by  any  authority,  but there  was  probably  occupation  both  inside  and  outside  the wall  (ibid.).  Papandreou  seems  to  believe  that  the  site  was  of considerable  size  (Prakt  ( 1920)  128\u00ad29).  Inside  the  wall  there are  remains  of  foundations,  and  tiles  and  sherds  cover  the ground.  A  plan  of  the  site  is  found  in  Papachatzis  ( 1994)  269. For  a  possible  suburban  temple  (undated),  see  Prakt ( 1920)  128;  a  passage  in  Herodotos  connects  the  Dioskouroi with  Paion  (Hdt. 6.127.3),  but  that  is  all  we  know  about  the pantheon  of  the  city. 289.

In  Theophrastos'  day Nonakris  was  presumably situated  inside  the  territory  of  Pheneos  (no. 291)  (Theophr. fr. 160;Meyer ( 1937a)  860);  if  the  city  was  still  in  existence, the  presumption  is  that  it  was  a  dependent  polis  within  the territory  of  Pheneos.

Helisson  is  called  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  SEG 37 340.6\u00ad7  (C 4f) and  Diod. 16.39.5  (r 352),  and  in  the  political 512 nielsen sense  by SEG 37  340.5  (C 4f).The  individual  use  of  the  ethnic is  unattested,  but  the  collective  use  is  found  externally  in SEG 37  340  (C 4f),  IG iv\u00b2.142.2  (c. 300)  and  in  Polyb. 11.11.6. The  territory is  referred  to as  by SEG 37  340.5  (C 4f) and  Polyb. 11.11.6  (r 207). Helisson  was  a  Mainalian  city  (Paus. 8.27.3  (r 371);  Nielsen ( 1996a)  132\u00ad34),  and  it  can  be  inferred  from  a  combination of  IG v.21.16  ( 360s)  and  Paus. 8.27.3  (r 371)  (cf.  Nielsen ( 1996a)  132\u00ad34)  that  the  city  was  a  member  of  the  Arkadian Confederacy.  Membership  of  the  Peloponnesian  League may  be  assumed  (Nielsen  ( 1996c)  87). In C 4f,  Helisson  concluded  a  treaty  with  Mantinea  (no. 281)  (SEG 37  340),  whereby  all  citizens  of  Helisson  became Mantinean  citizens;  the  city  of  Helisson  was  left  in  existence as  a  \u00b5  of  Mantinea,  but  continued  to  be  a  polis  none  the less  (SEG 37  340.6\u00ad7);  it  is  debatable  whether  Helisson  was  to survive  as  a  polis  merely  in  the  urban  sense  (so  Rhodes  ( 1995) 97),  or  whether  the  city  was  constituted  as  a  dependent  polis within  the  Mantinike  (so  Hansen  ( 1995a)  39,(1995b)  73\u00ad74; Nielsen  ( 1996c)  67\u00ad70).  The  treaty  does  not  call  itself  a  sym- politeia,  but  simply  a  (SEG 37  340.2);  it  has,  how- ever,  become  customary  to refer  to the  agreement  as  a sympoliteia,  for  which  concept  see  Hansen  ( 1995b)  56.After the  treaty,  Helisson--like the other dependencies of Mantinea--was entitled t o  send  a  thearos  to  the  Mantinean board  of  thearoi  ( 8\u00ad9:        `  [ ]         ). According  to  Paus. 8.27.3  (r 371),  Helisson  was  among  the communities  that  the  Arkadian  Confederacy  voted  to  relo- cate  to  Megalopolis  (no. 282);  it  is  not  known,  however, whether  this  decision  was  implemented,  and  the  city  still existed  in  352,  when  it  was  captured  and  pillaged  by  the Spartans  (Diod. 16.39.5). No theorodokos  is  attested  for  Helisson,  but  SEG 37 340.9\u00ad10:        suggests that  the  city  was  connected  to  some  system  of  theorodokia. By  the  treaty  SEG 37  340  (C 4f),  Helisson  adopted  the Mantinean  constitution  and  thus  became  a  democracy (Nielsen  ( 1996c)  69\u00ad70);  it  is,  however,  clear  from  the inscription  (which  among  other  things  mentions  a  body  of local  laws, \u00b5  (l. 15))  that  Helisson  had  its  own  constitu- tion  before  the  agreement,  although  what  form  it  took  is unknown.  The  treaty  is  the  only  surviving  public  enactment of  Helisson;  at  l. 17  it  refers  to  a  local  board  of \u00b5  (te Riele  ( 1987)  180;  Nielsen  ( 1996a)  160  n. 56). The  local  pantheon  is  unknown,  but  in  SEG 37  340.9\u00ad10    ...     `  [ ]/  is  presumably  a  refer- ence  to  local  communal  cults  which  were  to  be  preserved after  the  unification of  Helisson  and  Mantinea.

It  was  divided  into  two  sub-plains: the  southern  was  the  smaller  and  higher  ( 630  m);  the  northern  was  larger  and  lower  ( 620  m),  but  suffered  from drainage  problems  (Jost  ( 1985)  114).  The  city  itself  was  cen- tred  on  a  hill  rising  to  929  m  and  situated  in  a  dominating position  between  the  two  plains.  A  number  of  sanctuaries  in the  border  zones  of  the  territory are  attested  by written sources,  but  none  has  been  securely  identified (cf.  Jost  ( 1985) 119\u00ad21).  Prior  to  the  foundation  of  Megalopolis  (no. 282), Orchomenos  was,  presumably,  the  centre of  an  organisation comprising  a  number  of  minor  poleis  dependent  on  it, among  which  were  Methydrion  (no. 283),  Thisoa  (no. 301) and  Teuthis  (no. 298)  (Paus. 8.27.4  (r 371));  exactly  how  this organisation  functioned  is  unclear,  and  it  is  also  unclear whether  these  minor  poleis  were  conceived  of  as  situated within  Orchomenian  territory.  Cf.  Nielsen  ( 1996b)  231\u00ad36, ( 1996c)  84\u00ad86. The  only  indication  we have of  the  order  of  size  of  the Orchomenian  population  is  the  fact  that  the  city  fielded  600 hoplites  at  Plataiai  in  479  (cf.

Hell. 5.4.37,  and  can  be  inferred  for  C 5  on  the  basis  of Thuc. 5.61.4,  63.2.At 5.61.5  Thucydides  relates  how Orchomenos  in  418  joined  the  quadruple  alliance  of  Argos (no. 347),  Athens  (no. 361),  Elis  (no. 251)  and  Mantinea  (no. 281):  after  a  siege,  the  city  agreed  to  join  the  alliance  and  give hostages  to  the  Mantineans,  and  we  may  therefore  consider Orchomenos  to  be  the  subordinate  party  to  this  treaty.  On  the other  hand,  the  C 4m  treaty  of  sympoliteia  between Orchomenos  and  Euaimon  (no. 269)  (IPArk  no. 15)  was expressly  concluded           \u00b5  (ll. 4\u00ad5).  Although  the  city  at  first opposed the A rkadian Confederacy,  owing  to  hatred  ( ) of  Mantinea  (Xen. Hell. 6.5.11),  Orchomenos  did  eventually  join  the Confederacy  (IG v.21.46  ( 360s)). In 480,  120  Orchomenian  hoplites  were present  at Thermopylai  (Hdt. 7.202),  and  the  next  year  600  fought  at Plataiai  (Hdt. 9.28.4).  In  378/7  Orchomenos  fought  a  war with  Kleitor  (no. 276)  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.36),  and  in  370  hoplites of the  city  fought  against  Mantinean  troops  in Orchomenian  territory (Xen.  Hell. 6.5.13).An Orchomenian strategos  is  implied  by  Hdt. 7.202  and 204,  and  a  board  of \u00b5  is  attested  by  IPArk  no. 14.31\u00ad32  ( 360s).  A  cit- izen  of  Orchomenos  was  appointed  proxenos  by  Olbia  (no. 690)  in  C 4  (I.Olbia 4  Dubois  ( 1996)  17)  and  one  by  Tegea (no. 297)  in  C 4l  (SEG 11  1051);  the  earliest  attested  grant  by the  city  itself  dates  to  C 3f(SEG  25  443).  The  earliest  surviv- ing  public  enactment  is  IPArk  no. 15  of 360\u00ad350,  a treaty  of sympoliteia  with  Euaimon;  the  earliest  decrees  date  to  C 3f: e.g.  SEG 25  443.  Execution  of  citizens  is  referred  to  by  Diod. 19.63\u00ad65  (r 315).  In  C 4  we  find boards of and \u00b5  (IPArk  no. 14.30\u00ad31  ( 360s)). Orchomenos  occupied  the  top  and  southern  slope  of  the Kalpaki  hill,  which  rises  to 939  m.  The  hill  was  enclosed  with a  circuit  wall  c. 350\u00ad325  (Winter  ( 1989)  195).  It  has  been  suggested  that  there  was  no  proper  urban  site  within  the  fortifications (Osborne ( 1987)  118),and  certainly  no  substan- tial  residential  area  has  yet  come  to  light,  which,  however, may  not  be  very  significant since the archaeological investi- gations  have  been  directed  primarily  towards  the  agora,  the theatre  and  the  temple  of  Artemis.  Furthermore,  it  should  be noted  that  von  Gaertringen  and  Lattermann  ( 1911)  20  con- cluded  that  there  was  habitation  within  the  circuit  \"bis  tief  in die  Hellenistische  Zeit\".  Cf.  Jost  ( 1999)  240  n. 51. The  city  proper  seems  to  have  been  situated  at  the  foot  of the  southern  slope  of  the  Kalpaki  hill  (Meyer  ( 1939b)  890) both  before  the  construction  of  the  circuit  wall  and  after  its abandonment;  here  Geometric  and  Archaic  material  has come  to  light  (Blum  and  Plassart  ( 1914)  81\u00ad88),  as  well  as Roman  material  (Meyer  ( 1939b)  893).  Attention  has  been directed  primarily  at  sacred  buildings.  At  least  one  and  perhaps  two  temples  were  built  in  the  Archaic  period  in  the lower  city;  the  building  which  was  definitely a t emple  meas- ured  31.3 13.3  m  with  six  times  thirteen  columns;  it  is unknown  to  which  divinity  it  was  dedicated  (Jost  ( 1985) 118\u00ad19;  Voyatzis  ( 1990)  32\u00ad33). Pausanias  at  8.13.2  explicitly  states  that  the   was  on  the  Kalpaki  hill,  but  that  in  his  day  habitation was  under  ( )  the  circuit  wall,  and  so  far  the  archaeologi- cal  material  supports  this.  We  may  then  believe  him  when  he implies  that  in  the  Classical  period  habitation  was  within the  circuit  wall.  The  inference  is  that  in  C 4  the  city  was moved  from  the  southern  slope  to  the  hill  when  the  wall  was constructed  (so  Winter  ( 1989)  194\u00ad95),  although  habitation in  the  former  town  seems  not  to  have  ceased  (cf.  PECS  s.v. 524 nielsen Orchomenos,  p. 654).  But  the  urban  history  of  Orchomenos is  by  no  means  entirely  clear. The  fortification wall encloses the upper part of  the Kalpaki  hill;  it  was  2,300  m  long  and  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 20 ha.  It was  constructed  c. 350\u00ad325  (Winter  ( 1989)  195);  how- ever,  Thuc. 5.61.5,Diod.  12.79.2  (r 418)  and  Xen.  Hell. 6.5.13 mention  a  ,  but  where  this  ran  is  unknown. The  agora  was  laid  out  in  a  single  building  programme  in C 4s  (Winter  ( 1987)  235\u00ad39).  The  northern  and  eastern  edges of  the  agora  were flanked b y stoas  of  C 4s;  the  eastern  stoa  is sometimes  thought  to  have  been  a  bouleuterion  (e.g.  Blum and  Plassart  ( 1914)  73);  but  Winter  ( 1987)  238\u00ad39  thinks  that it  was  simply  a  stoa.  West  of  the  agora  is  a  C 4l  theatre (Winter  ( 1987)  235;  TGR  ii. 229),  and  south  of  the  agora,  on  a terrace  supported  by  a  retaining  wall  is  a  poros  temple  of Artemis  Mesopolitis  (Jost  ( 1985)  117\u00ad18);  the  preserved remains  are  probably  C 4,  but  Winter  ( 1991)  213  suggests  that it  had  an  Archaic  predecessor. The  patron  divinity  was  presumably  Artemis  Mesopolitis (Meyer  ( 1939b)  904);  on  the  basis  of  the  theatre  and  a C 4l\u00adC3e  dedication  describing  a  man  as   and  found  in  the  theatre  (SEG 11  1104)  we  may assume  the  existence  of  a  festival  of  Dionysos. The  Orchomenian  mint  was  late;  according  to  Head,  HN \u00b2 451  it  began  to  function  immediately  after  370;  according  to Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 3.  624  it  began  after  362.  The  legend  is   (SNG  Cop.  Argolis 267),  or  (SNG  Cop. Argolis 265\u00ad66).  All  known coins  are  of  bronze.  Some  inter- esting  coin  types  show  obv.  Artemis  kneeling,  sometimes with  a  dog  behind  her,  shooting  an  arrow;  rev.  Kallisto falling  back  pierced  by  an  arrow,  on  the  ground  beside  her her  child  Arkas,  sometimes  with  his  name  in  monogram (SNG  Cop.  Argolis 265\u00ad66);  these  types  are  found  copied  at Methydrion,  one  of  the  cities  thought  to  have  been  a dependency  of  Orchomenos  (see  Methydrion  (no. 283)). 287.

At 8.27.3  (r 371)  Pausanias  retrospectively  lists  Dipaia  as  a polis,  and  at  3.11.7  (rC 5f)  it  is  classified as a polisma.The 510 nielsen collective  use  of  the  ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  Hdt. 9.35.2  and  on  SEG 23  179  (C 4f);  the  individual  use  of  the  eth- nic  is  attested  externally  at  Paus. 6.7.9  (r 440)  (Olympionikai 314). The  name  of  the  territory  is  unknown;  Paus. 8.30.1  refers to  it,  contemporaneously,  as   .In the 460s an  apparently  major  battle  was  fought  near  Dipaia  between Sparta  (no. 345)  and  an  Arkadian  alliance  (Hdt. 9.35.2;Isoc. 6.99). A  C 4f  inscription  (SEG 23  179)  mentions  the  ;the nature  of  the  inscription  is  not  clear,  but  Bradeen  ( 1966)  321 thinks  that  it  is  a  fragment  of  a  record of  a  judgment  by a  for- eign  board  of  arbitration  in  a  dispute  involving  the  city  of Dipaia.  Dipaia  was  a  Mainalian  city  (Paus. 3.11.7,6.7.9,8.27.3; for  the  last  passage,  see  Nielsen  ( 1996a)  132\u00ad34),  but  this  is the  only  explicitly  attested  membership  of  a  larger  organisa- tion;  however,  membership  of  the  Arkadian  Confederacy can  be  inferred  from  a  combination  of  Paus. 8.27.3  (r 271) and  IG v.21.16  ( 360s;  see  further  Nielsen  ( 1996c)  95\u00ad96, 100\u00ad1),  and  membership  of  the  Peloponnesian  League  may be  assumed  (ibid. 87).  According  to  Paus. 8.27.3  (r 371), Dipaia  was  among  the  communities  that  the  Arkadian Confederacy  voted  to  relocate  to  Megalopolis  (no. 282); however,  it  is  unknown  whether  this  decision  was  imple- mented  (Moggi  ( 1974)  83\u00ad84). If  Dipaia  is  to  be  identified w ith  the  remains  at  Davia (supra),  then  the  city  was  centred  on  a  fortified acropolis.

For a  discussion  of  toponym  and  ethnic,  see  Meyer  ( 1934)  1618. Thelphousa  is  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  at  SEG 12 371  ( 242),  and  in  the  urban  sense  at  Polyb. 2.54.13;  it  is referred to as in  IG v.2412.2  (Classical).

The  territory occupied  c. 275  km \u00b2  and  was  called (Lycoph.  Alex. 1040;Polyb.  4.60.4).  Steph.  Byz. 306.5  describes  Thelphousa  as  a     '\u00b5  .  Orchomenos  (no. 286)  seems  to have ruled  a number  of  dependent  poleis  (Nielsen  ( 1996c)  84\u00ad86),  but there  is  no  other  evidence  that  Thelphousa  was  one  of  these (Meyer  ( 1934)  1619).  At  8.25.1  Pausanias  mentions  a  kome  by the  name  of ;  the  settlement  may  have  existed  by  C 4e (Jost  ( 1986b)  644),  and  its  raison  d'\u00eatre  was  presumably  to look  after  the  sanctuary  of  Asklepios  Kaousios  (Jost  ( 1986a) 149).  Kaous,  at  modern  Voutsi,  lay  6.5  km  north  of  the  city (Jost  ( 1985)  63).  C. 2  km  south  of  the  city  Meyer  ( 1957b)  13ff found  traces  of  a  settlement  which  includes  a  C 6l\u00adC5e  tem- ple  and  thus  existed  in  the  Classical  period;  it  must  have  con- stituted  a  second-order  settlement  of  Thelphousa,  possibly to  be  identified w ith  ancient  Onkeion  (Paus. 8.25.4;  cf.  Jost ( 1985)  66).  Another  small  settlement  in  the  same  general area  is  mentioned  by  Meyer  ( 1957b)  15.  For  a  possible  settle- ment  at  Bertsia,  see  Jost  ( 1985)  67.A  fortress  called  , was  likewise  situated  in  Thelphousian  territory  (Polyb. 4.73.2;Meyer ( 1934)  1619).  It  has  not  yet  been  located.  The territory  was  dotted  with  sanctuaries  (see  Jost  ( 1985)  66 (Classical), 67  (Archaic/Classical), 68  (possibly  a  temple), 68\u00ad69,  69  (a  temple  and  Archaic  votives)). K.  Tausend  ( 1993)  18  argues  that  Thelphousa  was  an Azanian  community,  but  certainty  is  impossible  (Nielsen and  Roy  ( 1998)  33\u00ad36).  In  any  case,  even  if  the  Azanians  ever formed  a  political  unity,  this  had  broken  up  before  C 5  (Roy arkadia  533 ( 1972b)  44,(1996)  110;  Nielsen  ( 1996a)  139).  Membership  of the  Peloponnesian  League  is  not  explicitly  attested,  but  may be  assumed  (Nielsen  ( 1996c)  87);  membership  of  the Arkadian  Confederacy  is  attested  by  IG v.21.64  ( 360s). IG v.2412  is  a  Classical  epigram  commemorating  fallen warriors,  and  may  perhaps  be  connected  with  the  battle fought  at  Thelphousa  in  352  (Diod. 16.39.6).  Thelphousian diplomatic  activity is  implied  by the  C 5e  dedication  of  a  her- ald's  staff  at  Olympia  which  was  inscribed   \u00b5 (SEG 11  1254a). The  form  of  constitution  is  unknown;  a  Classical  epigram commemorating  fallen  warriors  refers  to  their  saving  the \u00b5  ... (IG v.2412.6).  Otherwise  the  earliest preserved  public  enactment  is  SEG 12  371  of 242,an  asylia decree  for  Kos;  it  attests  to  an  assembly  in  the  enactment  for- mula      [ ]   . \"Ancient  Thelphousa  is  situated  on  the  left  bank  of  the Ladon  about  one  kilometer  north  of  the  hamlet  of  Toubitsi\" (Pritchett  ( 1989)  38).  The  city  was  situated  on  a  hill  and  cov- ered  an  extensive  area  on  the  lower  slopes,  not  all  of  which was  occupied  (Jost  ( 1985)  62).  Numerous  scattered  remains have  been  found,  particularly  in  the  lower  city  (ibid.).  For  a plan,  see  Jost  ( 1986b)  fig. 4.  The  only  well-known feature  of the  city  is  the  agora.  It  was  huge,  measuring  130 c. 120  m, and  was  laid  out  on  an  artificial t errace  supported  by  a retaining  wall  (Jost  ( 1986b)  638).  The  agora  was  flanked b y stoas  on  all  four  sides,  the  western  stoa,  however,  running  for only  half  the  length  of  the  agora;  on  the  southern  side,  the agora  was  flanked b y a  C 4  stoa  which  measured  at  least  78 7  m  (ibid.).  For  a  plan,  see  Jost  ( 1986a)  fig. 5.All  in  all,  the  lay- out  and  construction  of  the  agora  is  C 4  (Jost  ( 1986b)  642). No  monumental  structures  have  been  found  on  the  acro- polis  (ibid. 637).  The  city  was  walled,  and  traces  of  the  wall are  extant,  but  have  not  been  investigated  separately;  cf. Meyer  ( 1939a)  86\u00ad87.  It  may,  however,  be  noted  that  a Classical  epigram  (  IG v.2412)  commemorating  fallen warriors  probably  refers  to the  wall  (  ). Thelphousa  began  minting  c. 400  and  struck  in  both  silver and  bronze,  the  bronze  issues  beginning  perhaps  only  c. 323 (Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 3.  621\u00ad22);  the  legends  used  are: ,   (Head,  HN \u00b2  456;Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 3  nos. 935\u00ad39).

Eutaia  was  a  Mainalian  city  (Paus. 8.27.3;  Nielsen  ( 1996a) 132\u00ad34).  Membership  of  the  Arkadian  Confederacy  is proved  by Xen.  Hell. 6.5.12;  membership  was  probably  medi- ated  by  the  tribal  state  of  the  Mainalians  (Nielsen  ( 1996c) 95).  Membership  of  the  Peloponnesian  League  may  be assumed  (ibid. 87). According  to  Paus. 8.27.3,  Eutaia  was  among  the communities  that  the  Arkadian  Confederacy  voted  to  relo- cate  to  Megalopolis  (no. 282).  It  is  unknown  whether  the relocation  was  ever  carried  out:  the  site  seems  not  to  have been  abandoned,  since  coins  of  the  Arkadian  and  Achaian Confederacies  have been  found  there  (Loring  ( 1895)  50; Pikoulas  ( 1988)  70\u00ad73). At Hell. 6.5.12,  Xenophon  mentions  that  in  370  Eutaia raised  troops,  which  were  put  under  the  command  of  the Arkadian  Confederacy. Eutaia  was  located  at  modern  Lianos;  the  site  has  not  been excavated.  Xen.

The  only  source  that  classifies Gortys as a polis  is  Paus. 8.27.4  (r 371)  and  28.1  ( \u00b5    '   \u00b5  ,       ),  but  the  external  collective  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  found  on  a  C 5f  dedication  of  spoils  at  Delphi (Syll. \u00b349).  The  ethnic  is  attested  as  a  personal  name  already in  C 6  (Nielsen  ( 1996a)  122). Gortys  was  a  Kynourian  community  (Paus. 8.27.4; Nielsen  ( 1996a)  132\u00ad34).  Membership  of  the  Peloponnesian League  can  be  assumed  (Nielsen  ( 1996c)  87);  membership  of the  Arkadian  Confederacy  is  proved  by  a  combination  of  IG v.21.40  ( 360s)  and  Paus. 8.27.4  (Nielsen  ( 1996a)  132\u00ad34). According  to  Paus. 8.27.4,  Gortys  was  among  the communities  that  the  Arkadian  Confederacy  voted  to  relo- cate  to  Megalopolis  (no. 282).  It  is,  however,  unknown whether  this  decision  was  implemented,  and  the  site  seems not  to  have  been  abandoned  (Moggi  ( 1974)  91\u00ad92). C 5f  military  activity  by  Gortys  can  be  inferred  from  Syll. \u00b3 49  (   \u00b5),  a  dedication  of  spoils set  up  at  Delphi. The  site  of  Gortys  is  situated  on  the  western  bank  of  the river  Lousios/Gortynios  near  the  modern  village  of Atsicholo.  It  is  dominated  by  two  sanctuaries:  an  upper sanctuary  with  a  fortified \" acropolis\"  and  a  lower  sanctuary. The  upper  sanctuary  was  dedicated  to  Asklepios  and  con- tains  a  C 4e  stoa  (Jost  ( 1985)  204),  a  C 5l\u00adC4e  fountain  house (ibid.),  and  a  C 5l\u00adC4e  prostyle  Doric  temple  (ibid.).  The acropolis  measures  425  160/100  m.  The  fortifications w ere constructed  entirely  in  local  stone,  at  least  some  of  which was  quarried  on  the  acropolis  itself  (Martin  ( 1947\u00ad48)  112). In  general,  archaeology  points  to  a  date  after  370  for  the  fortifications.  Martin  ( 1947\u00ad48)  139  believes  that  the  fort- ifications w ere  erected  by  Megalopolis/the  Arkadian Confederacy  as  a  military  outpost  protecting  Megalopolitan territory;  a  large  number  of  C 4  Arkadian  federal  coins  have been  found  on  the  acropolis  (ibid.),  pointing  to  a  C 4m  date for  the  fortifications.  Furthermore,  there  are  no  remains  on the  acropolis  linking  the  fortifications t o  the  city  of  Gortys (Martin  ( 1947\u00ad48)  142).  If  Martin  is  right,  this  is  not  really the  acropolis  of  Gortys,  but  a  military  fort;  this  interpreta- tion  is  accepted  by  Jost  ( 1999)  197,  but  the  fortification may also  have  served  the  local  population,  turning  Gortys  into  a settlement  of  the  ville  acropole  type  described  by  Jost  ( 1999) 193\u00ad98.  The  lower  sanctuary  lay  500  m  north  of  the  acropo- lis,  and  the  residential  area  was  presumably  situated between  the  two  sanctuaries  (BCH 79  ( 1955)  335):  at  least  one house  excavated  there  dates  to  C 4  (BCH 80  ( 1956)  402),  but in  contrast  to  the  sanctuaries,  the  city  proper  is  not  well known,  and  no  sketch  of  it  can  be  given  (for  a  plan,  see Papachatzis  ( 1994)  298).  The  lower  sanctuary  was  likewise dedicated  to  Asklepios  and  contains  a  stoa  of,  possibly,  C 4 (BCH 79  ( 1955)  340),  a  C 4s  bath  (Jost  ( 1985)  205)  and  a  large temple,  laid  out  c. 370  but  apparently  never  finished (ibid. 206\u00ad7).  There  is  no  obvious  explanation  for  the  existence  of two  Asklepieia,  and  apart  from  Asklepios  the  local  pantheon is  not  well  known  (ibid. 202\u00ad3,  205). 272. ", "Tegea": "Identifier: 298. , in  362  sent  an embassy  to  Boiotia;  Tegea  received  envoys  from  Corinth (no. 227)  and  Argos  (no. 347)  in  421  (Thuc. 5.32.3)  and  from arkadia  531 Epidauros  (no. 348)  in  C 4f(IG  iv\u00b21  102.A.ii.102).  In  C 4e,  the city  granted  proxenia  to  a  man  from  Orchomenos  (no. 286) (SEG 11  1051),and  in  C 4m  two  Tegeans  were  granted  Delphic proxenia  (SEG 31  560);  in  C 4\u00adC3  an  Argive  theorodokos resided  in  Tegea  (SEG 33  283). A  system  of  four,  presumably  territorial,  phylai  is  attested, but  its  functions  are  unknown;  Paus. 8.53.6  names  them ,  `,  and , and  these  names  occur  on  a  C 3  inscription  (IG v.236)  as `,  ,  etc.;  Jones,  POAG 139\u00ad42. There  was  an  Aristotelian   (fr.608),but there  is  no  direct  evidence  about  the  form  of  constitution; however,  a  stasis  is  described  at  Xen.  Hell. 6.5.7;  this  stasis brought  the  demos  to  power,  and  it  can  be  inferred  that  prior to  the  stasis  Tegea  was  an  oligarchy  governed  in  accordance with   \u00b5;a \u00b5  is  referred  to in  IPArk  no. 1.8,  19\u00ad20  (C 5).  The  earliest  surviving  public  enactment  is SEG 11  1051  of  C 4e  (     ).  The eponymous  official was presumably the priest of  Athena Alea  (IPArk  no. 4  n. 1  (C 4));  a  board  called  (IPArk  nos. 2.20\u00ad21,  3.8  (C 5l\u00adC4e))  was  presumably  a  coun- cil,  and  one  called     possibly  its  executive committee  (IPArk  no. 1.20  with  n. 7  (C 5l\u00adC4e)).  In  addition, there  is  evidence  of  boards  of (Xen.  Hell. 6.5.7); \u00b5  (IPArk  no. 2.28  (C 5l\u00adC4e)); (  pole- tai)  (IPArk  no. 3.48  (C 4m));  and  h \u00b5\u00b5  (IPArk  no. 2.22\u00ad23  (C 5l\u00adC4e)).  In  addition,  IPArk  no. 2.5  attests  to  a h ,  and  SEG 11  1070  (C 4l)  to  an  agonothetes.The existence  of  an  assembly  can  be  inferred  from  SEG 11  1051 (C 4e):   ,for which formula see Rhodes (1995) 95\u00ad96.  A  local  calendar  is  attested  by  IPArk  no. 2.29\u00ad30 (C 5l\u00adC4e). The  layout  of  the  city  of  Tegea  is  not  well  known,  though there  are  indications  that  by  the  end  of  the  Archaic  period the  sanctuary  of  Athena  Alea  was  at  the  heart  of  a  well-devel- oped  site  (Morgan  ( 1999)  396\u00ad97);  \u00d8deg\u00e5rd  (AR  ( 2000\u00ad1) 32)  refers  to various  C 6s  and  C 5  finds from the city area.  A circuit  wall  and  two  gates  are  mentioned  at  Xen.  Hell. 6.5.8\u00ad9 in  reference  to 370;however,  Diod. 12.79.3  (r 418)  mentions  a poliorkia  of  Tegea,  thus  suggesting  that  the  city  was  walled  at this  date.  Furthermore,  at  5.62.2  Thucydides  states  that  in 418  some  people  in  Tegea  were  willing  to  betray  the  city  to the  democratic  quadruple  alliance  (            [sc.  of  Tegea]   \u00b5); if  insiders  were  necessary  to  conquer  the  city,  we  may assume  that  it  was  fortified.  The  preserved  remains  of  the C 4e  wall  show  it  to  have  been  constructed  in  mudbrick  on  a stone  foundation  (B\u00e9rard  ( 1892)  548;  cf.  Voyatzis  ( 1990)  12); traces  of  the  wall  were  reportedly  found  in  four  places,  thus giving  a  very  rough  indication  of  its  course  (B\u00e9rard  ( 1892) 547;  cf.  Voyatzis  ( 1990)  fig. 3),  and  this  course  has  now  been confirmed in its basic assumptions ( AR  ( 2000\u00ad1)  32)  except for  the  fact  that  the  sanctuary  of  Athena  Alea  seems  to  have been  outside  the  wall.  The  area  enclosed  by  the  wall  seems  to have  had  the  shape  of  \"an  irregular  ellipse,  with  the  long  axis measuring  2,000  metres  and  the  short  axis  1,400  metres\" (Voyatzis  ( 1990)  12;  cf.  B\u00e9rard  ( 1892)  547).  It  measured  max. c. 190  ha.  IPArk  no. 5  ( 324)  refers  to oikiai,  but  there  is,  unfor- tunately,  no  way  of  knowing  how  densely  populated  the large  area  inside  the  wall  was.  At  5.17.2  Polybios  refers  to the acropolis,  but  this  has  so  far  escaped  identification ( Voyatzis ( 1990)  16\u00ad17;  cf.  B\u00e9rard  ( 1892)  541\u00ad42). Little  is  known  about  public  architecture.  Xen.  Hell. 7.4.36 refers  to a  desmoterion  and  to  a  demosia  oikia.  There  are remains  of  a  C 4  theatre (Callmer  ( 1943)  121;  TGR  ii. 270).  A C 3  inscription  refers  to the  agora  (SEG 22  280.24).  But  the most  famous  Tegean  structure  was,  of  course,  the  temple  of Athena  Alea;  the  first monumental t emple  was  constructed C 7l  (Voyatzis  ( 1990)  11);  the  Classical  temple  was  construct- ed  c. 345\u00ad335  (Norman  ( 1984)  191\u00ad93). An  Athena  Poliatis  is  attested  by  Paus. 8.47.5  and  IG v.277 (Roman,  but  the  divinity  is  presumably  much earlier;  see Burkert  ( 1995)  208),but  the  real  patron  divinity  of  Tegea  was Athena  Alea  (Voyatzis  ( 1990)  14;  cf.  Jost  ( 1985)  142\u00ad65). Festivals  are  attested  by  IPArk  no. 2.26  (C 5l\u00adC4e)  and  IPArk no. 5.21\u00ad22  ( 324);  games  in  honour  of  Athena  Alea  are  attest- ed  as  early  as  Pind.  Ol. 7.83  (cf.  IG v.275  (C 6l),  113  (C 5e);  Jost ( 1985)  374);  a   \u00b5   is  mentioned  by  Paus. 8.47.4;  a  starting  line  block  of  uncertain  but  possibly  late Classical  date  is  published  by  Pakkanen,  Tegea  Stadium.A Pythian  victor  is  attested  for  554  (Paus. 10.7.7),  a  Nemean  for C 5  (Dubois  ( 1986)  TE  1),  and  an  Olympic  for  308  (Diod. 20.37.1).  Dedications  of  Spartan  and  Persian  spoils  were  set up  in  the  temple  of  Athena  Alea  (Hdt. 1.66.4,  9.70.3),  and  in 423  the  city  sent  Mantinean  spoils  to  Delphi  (Thuc. 4.134.1); in  Delphi,  too,  the  city  dedicated  Spartan  spoils  and  erected a  stoa  in  c. 369  (cf.  SEG 31  558\u00ad59;  Vatin  ( 1988)  453\u00ad59). According  to Head,  HN \u00b2454,  the  mint  at  Tegea  began  to strike  c. 420;  hoard  evidence,  however,  may  point  to  the Archaic  period  for  the  first c oinage  (cf.  IGCH 11,  buried c. 480;  Hesperia 24  ( 1955)  135\u00ad36).  The  city  struck  on  the Aiginetan  standard  and  minted  in  silver,  bronze  and  iron; the  single  surviving  iron  coin  (C 5s)  is  discussed  by  K\u00f6hler ( 1882b)  (cf.  also  MacIsaac  ( 1988)  48\u00ad49):  obv.  Gorgoneion; rev.owl .  Known  denominations  are  hemiobol, trihemiobol,  obol  and  triobol;  in  addition,  a  single 532 nielsen didrachm  is  known,  for  which  see  Schwabacher  ( 1939)  15\u00ad18.

Hell. 6.5.22  have  `;  coins  have   (Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 3  no. 1015). Heraia  is  listed  as  the  third  toponym  after  the  heading   \u00b5   (where  polis  is  used  in  the  urban sense)  in  Ps.-Skylax  44;  at  Xen.  Hell. 3.2.30  it  is  implicitly described  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  and  territorial  senses  com- bined  (for  the  idiom,  cf.  Diod. 2.43.6  and  see  Smyth,  Greek Grammar  \u00a7 1096);  at  Arist.  Pol. 1303a15\u00ad16  there  is  a  reference to  a  change  of  politeia  in  Heraia,  in  a  passage  ( 1302b40, 1303a15)  where  Heraia  is  listed  as  the  fourth  of  six  examples of  the  observation  that  a  polis  (in  the  political  sense)  consists of  sometimes  disproportionate  parts.  At  Paus. 8.26.1  there  is a  reference  to a  temple  of  Dionysos  Polites,  but  its  date  is unknown. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  internally  on coins  (Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 3  no. 1015),  and  externally  in  SEG 11 1045  (c. 500);  Thuc. 5.67.1;  IPArk  no. 15.19  (C 4m);  and  Xen. Hell. 6.5.11.  The  individual  use  is  found  externally  on  IG ii\u00b2 2327  (rC 6)  and  IG iv\u00b2.196.35  (C 3f). Xen.  Hell. 6.5.22  ( (sc.  the  Arkadian federal  troops) `)  suggests  that  the toponym  could  designate  the  territory  as  well  as  the  city, since  it  is  a  reasonable  inference  from  the  context  that  the federal  troops  were  operating  not  in  the  city,  but  in  the  ter- ritory  of  Heraia  (so  B\u00f6lte  ( 1913b)  415).  Its  size  was  c. 265 km \u00b2.  B\u00f6lte  ( 1913b)  estimated  the  citizen  population  at  min. 2,000. According  to  Strabo  8.3.2,  Heraia  was  synoecised  (at  an unknown  date:  Bergese  ( 1985))  from  nine  \u00b5.  These demes  were  perhaps  minor  settlements  in  the  territory. Their  identity  is  unknown,  but  B\u00f6lte  ( 1913b)  412  counted Melainai  and  Bouphagion  among  them.  A  site  which  he identified w ith  Bouphagion  is  described  by  Meyer  ( 1939a) 103\u00ad6,  but  Jost  ( 1985)  76\u00ad77  rejects  the  identification of  this site  with  Bouphagion.  The  impressive  fortifications of  the site  and  its  acropolis  are  Hellenistic  (Meyer  ( 1939a)  106;  Jost ( 1985)  76  states  that  they  are  Classical),  but  large  quantities of  Archaic  and  Classical  sherds  were  found  at  the  site  (Meyer ( 1939a)  102),  which  perhaps  had  a  temple  on  the  acropolis arkadia  513 (ibid. 106).  Meyer  ( 1957b)  20  identified another site,  Loutra Ireas,  near  Betsi  as  another  Heraian  \"Dorf  \". A  number  of  fortresses  in  the  territory  are  known;  one  at Ochthia  on  the  border  with  Thelphousa  (no. 300)  is described  by  Meyer  ( 1939a)  100\u00ad1:  sherds  at  the  site  go  back to  the  Archaic  period.  Near  Paloumba  is  another  fortified site (including  a  temple)  with  sherds  going  back  to the  Archaic period,  for  which  see  Meyer  ( 1939a)  102  and  Pikoulas  ( 1999a) 304\u00ad5  (suggesting  that  this  may  be  Melainai). The  symmachy  treaty  ML  17  (c. 500)  was  traditionally thought  of  as  concluded  between  Elis  (no. 251)  and  Heraia; however,  Dubois  ( 1985)  correctly  pointed  out  that  the  form '  (the  then  accepted  reading)  would  be  unique  for the  Heraian  ethnic  (cf.  Roy  ( 1997)  293\u00ad94);  a  recent  re- examination  of  the  text  (by  Roy  and  Schofield ( 1999))  has established  that  the  name  of  Elis'  partner  was  in  fact ',which should probably be thought of  as  an  other- wise  unknown  minor  community  in  Eleia  (see  Ewaoioi  (no. 253)). Heraia  fought  with  Sparta  (no. 345)  at  Mantinea  in  418 (Thuc. 5.67.1),  and  was  thus  a  member  of  the  Peloponnesian League.  The  city  was  loyal  to  Sparta  even  after  Leuktra  (Xen. Hell. 6.5.11),  although  it  eventually  joined  the  Arkadian Confederacy  (IG v.21.58  ( 360s)).Heraian  military  activity  is attested,  in  addition  to Thuc. 5.67.1,  by  Xen.  Hell. 6.5.11  and SEG 11  1045  (c. 500),  a  dedication  of  spoils  taken  from  the Heraians  and  set  up  by  an  unknown  Arkadian  community. IPArk  no. 15.19  (a  treaty  of  sympoliteia  between  Euaimon (no. 269)  and  Orchomenos  (no. 286))  stipulates  that  the Heraians  are  to  act  as  arbiters  in  case  of  conflicts o ver property rights.  A  Delphic  theorodokos  resided  in  Heraia  in C 5l\u00adC4e  (REG 62  ( 1949)  p. 6  ll. 11\u00ad12).  Nothing  is  known about  the  form  of  constitution  at  Heraia,  but  from  the  pas- sage  at  Arist.  Pol. 1303a15\u00ad16  it  can  be  inferred  that  at  some point  there  was  a  constitutional  reform  there  whereby  the procedure  for  the  appointment  of  magistrates  was  changed from  election  to  sortition.  B\u00f6lte  ( 1913b)  415  dates  the  reform to 370. At Diod. 15.40.2  (r 375)  a  Heraia  is  described  as  a   ;  if  this  is  a  reference  to  this  city  (which  has  been  dis- puted;  cf.  Stylianou  ( 1998)  ad  loc.),  it  may  mean  that  the  city was  fortified (B\u00f6lte ( 1913b)  414):  early  travellers  saw  the remains  of  well-built  walls,  but  these  may  have  been Hellenistic  (ibid. 408  and 415).  The  city  of  Heraia  seems  to have  occupied  a  large  area  (Jost  ( 1985)  73),  but  since  the  site has  not  been  systematically  investigated,  no  description  of the  urban  layout  is  possible  (Philadelpheus  ( 1931\u00ad32) reviews  the  remains  at  Heraia). Heraian  coinage  began  c. 510;  the  earliest  coins  are hemidrachms  and  obols:  obv.  head  of  Hera;  rev. ,, or ;  see  R.  T.  Williams  ( 1970)  and  SNG  Cop.  Argolis 231\u00ad33.  By  C 5l\u00adC4  the  city  struck  in  silver  (SNG  Cop.  Argolis 234\u00ad36)  and  possibly  even  in  iron  (for  which  see  K\u00f6hler ( 1882a)),  and  by  C 4  in  bronze  (SNG  Cop.  Argolis 236\u00ad41). Attested  denominations  are  triobol,  diobol,  trihemiobol, obol  and  hemiobol.  The  legends  are  ,,,,, ,  (Head,  HN \u00b2448;Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 1  nos. 1211\u00ad23  and  ii. 3  nos. 1000\u00ad15).The  most  common  types  depict female  deities  (Artemis  and  Athena),  but  Pan  is  found  too (Imhoof-Blumer  and  Gardner  ( 1964)  103). The  pantheon  of  Heraia  is  discussed  by  Jost  ( 1985)  70\u00ad77.

The  city-ethnic  is  in F.Delphes iii.4191  (C 5f)  and  CID ii  12.i.2  ( 341/40);  is  found  in  IG ii\u00b2  66c  (c. 400);  cf.  Roy  ( 1972a)  333\u00ad34. There  is  no  certain  attestation  of  polis  in  any  Archaic  or Classical  source:  in  Theopomp.  fr. 77.3 probably  does not  stem  from  Theopompos.  The  earliest  source  that  classi- fies K aphy(i)ai  as  a  polis  is  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 476.25,  92  (c. 265). The  city-ethnic  is  found  externally  in  the  collective  use  in F.Delphes iii.4191  (C 5f),  and  in  the  individual  use  in  IG ii\u00b2 66c  (c. 400)  and  CID ii  12.i.2  ( 341/40). The  territory occupied  c. 220  km \u00b2.A  Classical  sanctuary  in the  territory  is  reported  by  ArchDelt 37  ( 1982)  116  and  AR 37 ( 1991)  25;  for  another,  see  Pritchett  ( 1969)  125  and  Jost  ( 1985) 112.  For  a  possible  fortress,  see  Jost  ( 1985)  112. Kaphy(i)ai  was  a  member  of  the  revived  Peloponnesian League  of  King  Areus  of  Sparta  (no. 345)  for  the Chremonidean  War  (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 476.25),  but  member- ship  of  the  early  Peloponnesian  League  may  be  assumed  as well  (Nielsen  ( 1996c)  87).  Membership  of  the  Arkadian Confederacy  is  not  explicitly  attested,  but  may  be  assumed (ibid. 95). Kaphy(i)an  military  activity  can  be  inferred  from  F.Delphes iii.4191  (C 5f),  a  dedication  of  spoils  taken   [ ]  and  set  up  at  Delphi.  A  citizen  of  Kaphyiai was  Athenian  proxenos  in  C 5l  and  had  the  grant  renewed  after the  fall  of  the  Thirty  (IG ii\u00b2  66c  with  Walbank  ( 1978)  151\u00ad53). The  city  of  Kaphy(i)ai  was,  like  Mantinea  (no. 281),situat- ed  in  a  plain  and  not  centred  on  an  acropolis  (Pritchett 514 nielsen ( 1969)  123\u00ad24).  It  was  located  south-east  of  the  modern  vil- lage  of  Chotoussa,  and  the  site  is  covered  with  Classical sherds  and  other  remains  (Pritchett  ( 1969)  123\u00ad24;Howell ( 1970)  81;  Jost  ( 1985)  111).  There  are  also  remains  of  a  circuit wall  with  round  towers  at  Kaphy(i)ai,  but  they  have  not  been systematically  investigated  (Pritchett  ( 1969)  123\u00ad24). Among  isolated  finds from the city is an A rchaic  bronze  stat- uette,  reported  by  von  Gaertringen  and  Lattermann  ( 1911) 42  with  table  13.2. The  Kaphy(i)an  pantheon  is  almost  unknown  (Jost  ( 1985) 110\u00ad11);  Theophr.  Hist.  pl. 4.13.2  reports  that  Agamemnon  was held  to  have  planted  a  platanos  in  the  city. 276.  Kleitor  (Kleitorios) Map  58.  Lat. 37.55,long.  22.05. Size of  territory: 5.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is  found  as [ ()]  in  IG iv  510  (C 5f),as ,  in  Pind.  Nem. 10.47;  SEG 20  716  (C 4),and  as  in  SEG 23  189  (c. 330). The  city-ethnic  is  (Paus. 5.23.7  (rC 6s);  Maddoli ( 1992)  260;  Syll. \u00b3291  ( 332))  or  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.36; IG v.21.52  ( 360s)),  abbreviated  to on  C 5  coins (Head,  HN \u00b2446). No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  explicitly  calls  Kleitor  a polis,  but  at  Xen.  Hell. 5.4.37  the  city  is  referred  to  as  a  polis  in the  political  sense. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  C 5  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2446)  and  externally  in  Paus. 5.23.7 (rC 6s)  (cf.  Maddoli  ( 1992)  260);  IG v.21.52  ( 360s);  and  Xen. Hell. 5.4.36.  The  individual  use  is  attested  externally  in  IvO 167  (C 4f)  and  CID ii  51.7  (C 4m). The  name  of  the  territory  was  (Theophr.  Hist. pl. 9.15.6;Polyb.  4.11.2).  Pausanias  mentions  a  number  of sites  inside  the  territory:  Leukasion,  Mesoboa,  Nasoi,  Oryx, Halous  (no. 272),  Thaliades  (no. 299)  ( 8.23.8\u00ad24.3),  Soron, Paion  (no. 288),  Seirai,  Argeathai,  Lykountes  and  Skotane (cf.  Jost  ( 1985)  42\u00ad46).  Of  these,  Paion  and  Thaliades  were probably,  and  Halous  possibly,  poleis  at  some  time  (see  the respective  entries);  but  whether  they  were  dependent  poleis within  Kleitorian  territory  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  peri- ods  is  unknown,  though  not  impossible.  About  the  other toponyms,  nothing  is  known.  On  the  basis  of  the  map  in  Jost ( 1985),  the  size  of  the  territory  can  be  estimated  at  c. 625  km \u00b2, but  this  includes  Lousoi  (no. 279),  Paion,  Thaliades  and Halous:  it  is  unknown  whether  all  of  these  ever  formed  part of  Kleitor  prior  to the  Roman  era.  For  two  C 4s  fortresses,  see Pikoulas  ( 1999b)  144\u00ad53. Kleitor  was  almost  certainly  an  Azanian  community  (K. Tausend  ( 1993)  15);  however,  if  the  Azanians  ever  formed  a political  unit,  this  had  broken  up  before  C 5  (Roy  ( 1972b)  44, ( 1996)  110;  Nielsen  ( 1996a)  139).  Kleitor  may  just  possibly have  headed  a  small  hegemonic  league  in  northern  Arkadia (Nielsen  ( 1996c)  86\u00ad87).  The  city  was  a  member  of  the Peloponnesian  League  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.36\u00ad37)  before  the foundation  of  the  Arkadian  Confederacy  of  which  it  was  a member  (IG v.21.52  ( 360s)),  and  probably  a  leading  one since  it,  like  Mantinea  (no. 281)  and  Tegea  (no. 297),  provid- ed  two  of  the  ten  oecists  who  founded  Megalopolis  (no. 282) (Paus. 8.27.2  (r 371)). C 6s  military  activity  can  be  inferred  from  Paus. 5.23.2 (Maddoli  ( 1992)  260),  referring  to  spoils  dedicated  at Olympia  and,  according  to  the  accompanying  epigram, taken  by the  Kleitorians        \u00b5.At Hell. 5.4.36  Xenophon  has  a  brief  reference to a  war  in  379  between  Kleitor  and  Orchomenos  (no. 286) (cf.  Roy  ( 1972c));  for  this  war  the  Kleitorians  had  hired  mer- cenaries  (ibid.),  but  it  is  not  clear  whether  they  conducted the  war  exclusively  with  mercenaries.  Xen.  Hell. 5.4.37  refers to  the      ,  but  it  is not  clear  whether  he  was  a  citizen  or  a  mercenary  as  well. Xen.  Hell. 5.4.36  mentions  negotiations  between  Sparta (no. 345)  and  Kleitor,  and  SEG 20  716.14\u00ad15  refers  to an embassy  which  travelled  from  Kyrene  (no. 1028)  to Kleitor;  a Kleitorian  was  appointed  Delphic  proxenos  in 332  (Syll. \u00b3 291),  and  IG v.2  368  is  a  long  C 3e  catalogue  of  proxenoi  of Kleitor.  IPArk  no. 30,  a  sacred  law  of  c. 525,  may  belong  to Kleitor.  C. 330  an  Argive  theorodokos  resided  at  Kleitor  (SEG 23  189.ii.22).  In  C 4f  the  constitution  was  presumably  demo- cratic  (Roy  ( 1972c)  79).  SEG 20  716.18\u00ad19  (C 4m)  mentions  a sentence  of  exile  passed  by  the  Kleitorians. Like  Mantinea,  Kleitor  was  situated  in  a  plain  and  had  no acropolis  (Jost  ( 1985)  40;  Winter  ( 1989)  198  with  fig. 3).  The Hellenistic  fortification wall is  2,500  m  long  and  encloses  an area  of  c. 58  ha  (Petritaki  ( 1996)  83\u00ad84).  It is  built  of  stone throughout  (Winter  ( 1989)  198);  it  is  \"among  the  most advanced  anywhere  in  the  Peloponnese\",  and  so  Winter ( 1989)  199  dates  it  to  c. 300.  Inside  the  walled  area  are  numer- ous  ancient  remains,  and  a  theatre  is  discernible  (Petritaki ( 1996)  85;  cf.  TGR  ii. 237);  ceramic  evidence  suggests  that  the earliest  phases  of  the  construction  may  go  back  to  C 4 (Petritaki  ( 2001)).  Outside  the  wall  are  late  Archaic  and Classical  graves  (Petritaki  ( 1996)  84). According  to  Head,  HN \u00b2446,  minting  at  Kleitor  began c.C 5m;  Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 1.  877\u00ad88  dates  its  start  somewhat earlier.  The  city  struck  in  both  silver  (SNG  Cop.  Argolis 217\u00ad25)  and  bronze  (from  C 4;  SNG  Cop.  Argolis 226\u00ad30). Known  denominations  are  triobol,  obol,  hemiobol  and  possibly  tetartemorion  (SNG  Cop.  Argolis 218).  Recurrent arkadia  515 types  show  Athena,  horses  and  Helios  (cf.  Lacroix  ( 1968)). Legends  are  ,  ,  . The  Kleitorian  pantheon  is  imperfectly  known;  Athena Koria  was  probably  the  most  important  divinity  (Jost  ( 1985) 41\u00ad42).  Prestigious  games  were  celebrated  at  Kleitor  (Pind. Nem. 10.47;  Lazzarini  ( 1976)  no. 865  (C 5f)). Delphic  promanteia  is  granted  to  a  Kleitorian  by  Syll. \u00b3291 ( 332).  Two  Olympic  victors  from  the  city  are  on  record,  in 384  (Olympionikai 395)  and  in  376  (Olympionikai 406).  In C 6s  (Paus. 5.23.7;  for  which  see  Maddoli  ( 1992)  260),  the  city set  up  a  dedication  of  spoils  at  Olympia. 277. ", "Lykosoura": "Identifier: 281. , (Lykourasios) Map  58.  Lat. 37.25,long. 22.00.  Size  of  territory:  ?  Type:  C.  The  toponym  is ,  (SEG 41  332.45  (c. 230\u00ad190));  the  MSS  of Pausanias  have different  variants  of  this  form  (Meyer  ( 1927) 2417\u00ad18).  The  city-ethnic  is  in  SEG 41  332.1 (c. 230\u00ad190);  Pausanias  (e.g. 8.27.6  (r 371/70))  uses (Meyer  ( 1927)  2417). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  internally  in SEG 41  332.22\u00ad23  (c. 230\u00ad190)  and  externally  in  Paus. 8.27.5 (r 371)  (probably  taken  over  from  a  historiographic  source, see  Nielsen  ( 1996b)  296).  No  Archaic  or  Classical  source mentions  Lykosoura.  At  8.27.4  (r 371),  Pausanias  states  that Lykosoura  was  among  the  communities  that  the  Arkadian Confederacy  voted  to  relocate  to  Megalopolis  (no. 282); however,  he  goes  on  to  explain  that  this  decision  was  not implemented  ( 8.27.6),  because  the  city  resisted  the  reloca- tion.  Since  the  very  first source that mentions L ykosoura (SEG 41  332  (c. 230\u00ad190))  describes  it  as  a  polis  (in  the  polit- ical  sense,  e.g.  l. 3)  and  refers  to the  politai  (ll. 7\u00ad8),  it  is  pos- sible  that  at  the  foundation  of  Megalopolis  the  city  was  left as  a  dependent  polis  inside  Megalopolitan  territory.  Three other  cities  that  resisted  the  synoecism  (Lykaia,  Trikolonoi and  Trapezous  (no. 303))  were  either  forced  to  relocate (Lykaia  and  Trikolonoi)  or  annihilated  (Trapezous).  It  is thus  rather  remarkable  that  Lykosoura  was  spared,  and  we should  look  for  an  explanation.  According  to  Paus. 8.27.6, the  inhabitants  of  the  city  took  shelter  in  the  sanctuary  of Despoina  and  were  spared  \" \u00b5    \".  The  best  explanation,  then,  seems  to  be  that the  city  was  allowed  to  exist  in  order  to  look  after  the important  sanctuary  at  which  it  was  situated  (see  also  the judicious  remarks  by  Meyer  ( 1927)  2431  on  the  importance of  the  sanctuary  in  comparison  with  the  city).  And  in  fact, the  decree  SEG 41  332  (c. 223\u00ad190)  that  shows  Lykosoura  act- ing  as  a  polis  concerns  business  related  to  the  sanctuary.  This points  to  the  conclusion  that  after  the  synoecism  Lykosoura was  a  dependent  polis  in  charge  of  an  important  sanctuary inside  the  polis  of  Megalopolis  (see  Meyer  ( 1927)  2431\u00ad32, suggesting  that  citizens  of  Lykosoura  were  also  citizens  of Megalopolis;  cf.  Jost  ( 1999)  194). Before  the  synoecism  of  Megalopolis,  Lykosoura belonged  to  the  Parrhasian  tribe  (Paus. 8.27.4;  Nielsen ( 1996a)  132\u00ad34).  In  C 5s  the  Parrhasians,  and  thus  probably Lykosoura,  were  members  of  a  local  hegemonic  league  led by  Mantinea  (no. 281),  for  which  see  Nielsen  ( 1996c)  79\u00ad86. Membership  of  the  Peloponnesian  League  may  be  assumed; it  was  probably  mediated  by  the  Parrhasian  tribe  (Nielsen ( 1996c)  97,  89,  100\u00ad1).  Membership  of  the  Arkadian Confederacy  through  the  Parrhasian  tribe  can  be  inferred from  Paus. 8.27.4  (cf.  Nielsen  ( 1996c)  87,  89,  100\u00ad1). The  date  at  which  the  monumental  buildings  in  the  sanc- tuary  at  Lykosoura  were  erected  is  not  certain,  but  may  be C 4  (Jost  ( 1985)  178).  Above  the  sanctuary  is  the  walled acropolis  of  the  city;  Meyer  ( 1927)  2426  dates  the  wall  to C 5\u00adC4  (so  PECS).  Ancient  temple  remains  were  reused  in  a chapel  (Meyer  ( 1927)  2426).  The  city  proper  (termed   by  Paus. 8.27.5)  was  on  the  northern  slope  of  the  acropolis, west  of  the  sanctuary;  Meyer  ( 1927)  2426  reports  that  \"der ganze  Nord-  und  Ostabhang  ist  mit  antiken  Tr\u00fcmmern \u00fcbers\u00e4t\". 281.

The  other  communities  so  described are  Methydrion  (no. 283)  and  Thisoa  (no. 301),  both  of which  were probably  poleis.  So,  by  analogy,  we  may  class Teuthis  as  a  possible  polis. According  to  Paus. 8.27.4,  Teuthis  was  among  the  com- munities  that  the  Arkadian  Confederacy  decreed  to  relocate to  Megalopolis;  it  is  unknown,  however,  whether  this  deci- sion  was  implemented,  and  the  site  seems  not  to  have  been abandoned  at  the  synoecism  (Pikoulas  ( 1986b)). The  city  proper  lay  below  the  acropolis.  The  site  is  now occupied  by  the  village  of  Dimitsana,  and  so  the  degree  of ancient  urbanisation  cannot  be  estimated;  but  Pikoulas ( 1986b)  116  reports  considerable  numbers  of  Archaic  and Hellenistic  sherds,  but  fewer  Classical.  The  acropolis  was fortified (ibid. 110  with  map  1  at 101).The  date  of  the  impres- sive  fortification is uncertain,  but  it  is  not  earlier  than  C 4 and  is  probably  Hellenistic  (ibid. 113). 299.

According  to  Paus. 8.27.3,  Pallantion  was  among  the  com- munities  that  the  Arkadian  Confederacy  voted  to  relocate  to Megalopolis  (no. 282);  but,  for  whatever  reason,  the  decision seems  not  to  have  been  implemented  (Moggi  ( 1974)  85\u00ad87), and  the  city  was  not  under  Megalopolitan  control  in  318:in this  year  the  city  was  captured  by  Polyperchon,  and  some citizens  were  taken  captives,  but  Pallantion  negotiated  for their  release  via  Argos  (no. 347),  not  Megalopolis  (SEG 11 1084). According  to  Xen.  Hell. 7.5.5,  Epameinondas  counted  on Pallantion  as  an  ally  for  the  battle  of  Mantinea  in  362,but it is  unknown  whether  Pallantian  troops  actually  fought  in  the battle.  In  c. 318\u00ad316,Pallantion  sent  an  embassy  to  Argos,  and the  envoys  were  all  granted  Argive  proxenia  (SEG 11  1084.27). In C 5l\u00adC4e  a  Delphic  theorodokos  resided  in  Pallantion (Daux  ( 1949)  6\u00ad8). Pallantion  was  centred  on  a  hill  of  moderate  height;  the city  proper  was  situated  in  the  plain  at  the  northern  and eastern  foot  of  the  hill;  it  appears  to  have  occupied  a  consid- erable  area  (Frazer  ( 1898)  iv. 421).  The  lower  town  has  not been  excavated,  but  remains  of  Classical  buildings  have  been found  reused,  and  Classical  sherds  have  also  come  to  light (Jost  ( 1985)  199).  A  Classical  cemetery  has  also  been  identi- fied (ibid.). The  acropolis  of  Pallantion  was  fortified,  but  the  date  of the  wall  has  not  been  established.  Inside  the  wall,  on  the  top of  the  acropolis  and  on  its  southern  slope,  are  no  fewer  than four  modest  temple  buildings  (for  which  see  \u00d8stby  ( 1995a)); all  the  buildings  seem  to  belong  to  a  single  programme  of construction  dating  to c. 600\u00ad550,  and  later  modifications are  discernible  (ibid. 54). According  to  Head,  HN \u00b2451,  Pallantion  began  to strike coins  c. 400;Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 3.  665\u00ad68  dates  the  coinage  to 421\u00ad371;  it  is  a  silver  coinage  on  the  Aiginetan  standard;  all known  coins  have  a  young  beardless  male  (  Apollo  or  the eponymous  hero  Pallas)  on  the  obv.  and  the  legend  , on  the  rev.  Known  denominations  are  the  obol and  the  hemiobol.  SNG  Cop.  Argolis 270. 526 nielsen 290. ", "Lousoi": "Identifier: 280. , (Lousiatas) Map  58.  Lat. 38.00,long.  22.05.

Dubois  ( 1986)  220);  a  series  of decrees  dating  to  C 4l  onwards  (IG v.2388\u00ad96)  frequently refers  to  the  city  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense.  The  collective use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  internally  in  IG v.2387  (C 5s) and  externally  in  IG v.2358  (C 3f?)  and  Polyb. 4.18.11.The external  individual  use  is  found  in  Xen.

The  name  and  size  of  the  territory  are  unknown;  IPArk no. 22  (C 3)  may  be  a  delimitation  of  the  border  between Lousoi  and  Achaian  Boura  (no. 233).  Stangl  ( 1999b) estimates  that  the  territory  could  support  max. 1,000  indi- viduals.  For  a  Classical  watch-tower  in  the  territory,  see  K.  Tausend  ( 1999b)  306\u00ad7. Lousoi  was  probably  an  Azanian  community  (K.  Tausend ( 1993)  15);  however,  if  the  Azanians  ever  formed  a  political unit,  this  had  broken  up  before  C 5  (Roy  ( 1972b)  44,(1996) 110;  Nielsen  ( 1996a)  138).  The  city  may  have  been  party  to  a treaty  as  early  as  500\u00ad475  (Nomima i  no. 57,  but  cf.  Dubois ( 1986)  220).A  C 3f(?)  treaty  with  Stymphalos  (no. 296)  is  pre- served  as  IG v.2358  (  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 560). The  earliest  public  enactment  of  Lousoi  is  a  C 5s  list  of proxenoi  (IG v.2387);  IPArk  no. 20,  a  sacred  law  of  c. 525,may belong  to  Lousoi.  The  decrees  IG v.2388\u00ad96  (C 4l  onwards) attest  to  an  eponymous  damiorgos,a board of  damiorgoi  and an  oikonomos.  From  the  enactment  formulas  (e.g.     (IG v.2389),   \u00b5()  []  (IG v.2  390)),  the  existence  of  an  assem- bly  may  be  inferred.  An enktesis  grant  is  found  in  IG v.2394 (C 3l).  According  to  Paus. 8.18.8,  Agesilas  of  Lousoi  was  vic- torious  in  the  Pythian  Games  in  546;  Eurybatos  of  Lousoi  is recorded  as  Olympic  victor  as  early  as  708  (Olympionikai 22);  cf.  S.  Tausend  ( 1999). The  acropolis  of  Lousoi  is  crowned  by  a  C 4  fortification wall,  possibly  of  mudbrick  on  a  polygonal  stone  foundation, and  encloses  an  area  of 0.3  ha  (Petropoulos  ( 1985)  67\u00ad73). South  of  the  acropolis  is  the  most  important  feature  of  the community  of  Lousoi:  the  sanctuary  of  Artemis  Hemera (Jost  ( 1985)  47),  the  pre-eminent  divinity  of  the  city. The  temple  is  Hellenistic,  but  an  older  structure  probably existed  (Jost  ( 1985)  49;  Voyatzis  ( 1990)  36).  For  a  plan  of  the sanctuary,  see  Jost  ( 1985)  pl. 5.1.  K.  Tausend  ( 1993)  suggests 516 nielsen that  the  sanctuary  at  Lousoi  was  originally  the  cultic  centre of  the  Azanian  tribe,  and  owed  its  continual  importance  to this  fact.  The  city  lay  c. 1  km  west  of  the  sanctuary,  at Phournoi,  where  there  are  numerous  ancient  remains  (Jost ( 1985)  48).  Private  houses  of  C 4\u00adC3  have  been  found;  see  AR ( 1984\u00ad85)  23,(1985\u00ad86)  28,(1988\u00ad89)  33\u00ad34,  and Mitsopoulos-Leon  ( 1985)  96. Apart  from  Artemis,  no  other  divinities  are  securely attested  at  Lousoi  (Jost  ( 1985)  50)  unless  IPArk  no. 20, mentioning  Demeter,  belongs  to  Lousoi.  The  city  certainly celebrated  games  in  honour  of  Artemis  by  C 3  (IG v.11387) but  may  already  have done  so  in  C 4  when  the  series  of decrees  granting  theorodokia  commences  (IG v.2388\u00ad96); cf.

The  toponym  is , (Polyb. 4.78.3;  SEG 25  448.15  (C 3s)),  or (Paus. 8.27.4).  The  city-ethnic  is   (Polyb. 4.77.10;  SEG 25  449.2  (C 2))  or  (CIG 1936 (Hell.);  Paus. 8.27.7);  see  Orlandos  ( 1967\u00ad68)  9\u00ad10. Alipheira  is  well  attested  only  in  Hellenistic  sources, where  it  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Polyb. 4.78.11  (r 219))  and  in  the  political  sense  (SEG 25  447.9  (C 3)). Since  Alipheira  certainly  existed  before  C 3  (infra),  the  city may  possibly  have  been  a  polis. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in SEG 25  449  (C 2f)  and  externally  in  Polyb. 4.77.10  and  IvO 48 (C 2);  the  external  individual  use  is  found  in  CIG 1936  (Hell.). The  territory  covered  c. 100  km \u00b2;  SEG 25  449  (C 2f)  has been  interpreted  as  a  demarcation  of  the  border  of Alipheira. According  to  Paus. 8.27.4,Alipheira  was  in  371  a  part  of  the tribal  state  of  the  Kynourians  (Nielsen  ( 1996a)  132\u00ad34, 140\u00ad41),  and  it  can  be  inferred  from  a  combination  of  IG v.2 1.40  ( 360s)  and  Paus. 8.27.4  (r 371)  (with  Nielsen  ( 1996a) 132\u00ad34)  that  the  city  was  a  member  of  the  Arkadian Confederacy.  Membership  of  the  Peloponnesian  League may  also  be  assumed  (Nielsen  ( 1996c)  87). According  to  Paus. 8.27.4,  Alipheira  was  one  of  the  cities that  the  Arkadian  Confederacy  had  voted  to  incorporate into  Megalopolis  (no. 282);  whether  this  decision  was  imple- mented  is  not  certain.  According  to  Paus. 8.26.5,a part  of  the population  actually  relocated  to  Megalopolis,  but  the  city was  not  abandoned.  In  C 3  Alipheira  was,  at  least  sometimes, controlled  by  Megalopolis  (Polyb. 4.77.10);  but  it  also appears  as  a  polis  (SEG 25  447). Alipheira  was  centred  on  a  hill  rising  to  686  m  above  sea level.  The  hill  measures  800  65  m  and  was  fortified before 370  (Orlandos  ( 1967\u00ad68)  32).  The  city  proper  seems  to  have lain  outside  these  walls  and  to  have  occupied  the  area  Most  of  the  territorial  sizes  given  in  this  Inventory  are  based  on  the  map  in Jost  ( 1985);  on  this  map  Jost  has  indicated  the  probable  borders  of  the  major poleis.  She  comments:  \"Il  va  de  soi  que  les  limites  ...sont approximatives:  elles marquent  la  zone  frontali\u00e8re  dont  seuls  quelques  points  ...sont assur\u00e9s.\"  It  may be  added  that  these  points  are  most  often  known  from  Pausanias,  and  so  the  bor- ders  indicated  reflect the R oman  period.  In  general,  there  is  no  way  of  knowing whether  this  corresponds  to  Archaic  and  Classical  conditions,  a  problem  further complicated  by  the  fact  that  we  do  have  information  which  indicates  that  borders  could  fluctuate e ven  within  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  (Nielsen ( 1996b)  181).  So  the  territorial  sizes  given  here  are  merely  educated  guesses. arkadia  509 north-east  of  the  acropolis  (ibid. 41).  The  lower  city  too  was fortified (Pritchett ( 1989)  44,no  dates).  In  the  eastern  part  of the  acropolis  was  the  sanctuary  of  Athena,  with  a  temple constructed  c. 500\u00ad490;  votives  go  back  to C 6m  (Jost  ( 1985) 80).  In  addition  to  the  temple,  the  sanctuary  included  a colossal  statue  of  Athena  dating  to  C 5  (ibid. 81).  In  the north-western  part  of  the  hill  was  a  sanctuary  of  Asklepios with  a  C 4s  temple  (ibid. 81). 267.Asea  (Aseates)  Map  58.  Lat. 37.25,long.  22.20.Size of territory: 2.

Hell. 6.5.15);  in  the  great  Delphic  catalogue  of  theorodokoi (c. 230\u00ad210)  we  find the entry     ,  but  this  form  is unique  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iii.9).  The  city-ethnic  is   on  the  Achaian  federal  bronze  coinage  of  the  city  (Head,  HN \u00b2 418  (c. 190s));  this  enables  us  to  emend  the  /   of  the  MSS  at  Xen.  Hell. 7.5.5  to . Asea  is  classified as a polis  in  the  territorial  sense  (with  the political  sense  as  a  possible  connotation)  at  Xen.  Hell. 7.5.5,a passage  that  also  provides  an  instance  of  the  external  collec- tive  use  of  the  city-ethnic.  Strabo  8.3.12  classifies A sea  as  a \u00b5  ,  but  the  reference  is  to C 1. The  territory  is  implicitly  referred  to  at  Xen.  Hell. 7.5.5  as polis  (Nielsen  ( 1996c)  72\u00ad73).  The  size  of  the  territory  has been  estimated  at  c. 60  km \u00b2  by  Fors\u00e9n  and  Fors\u00e9n  ( 1997)  175. The  city  of  Asea  was  not  the  only  place  of  habitation:  Fors\u00e9n and  Fors\u00e9n  ( 1997)  173  report  that  they  have  found  between twenty  and  thirty  sites  dating  from  the  Archaic  to  the Hellenistic  periods  in  the  chora.  Some  of  these  were presum- ably  isolated  farmsteads,  but  at  least  four  seem  to  have  been small  villages  connected  with  sanctuaries:  one  is  situated only 1.5  km  from  the  Vigla  temple,  while  another  was  prob- ably  situated  close  to a  temple  of  Athena  of  which  Fors\u00e9n and  Fors\u00e9n  have  found  scattered  architectural  remains  dating  to  C 4;  in  addition,  two  other  sites  may  have  been  vil- lages  and  one  of  these  was  possibly  also  connected  with  a sanctuary  (Fors\u00e9n  and  Fors\u00e9n  ( 1997)  172\u00ad74). Two  important  temples  have  been  excavated  in  the  territ- ory  of  Asea.  (a)  At Vigla,  on  the  border  with  Pallantion  (no. 289)  (Fors\u00e9n  and  Fors\u00e9n  ( 1997)  170),  is  a  temple  dedicated  to Athena  and  Poseidon;  it  is  dated  to  C 6  (\u00d8stby  ( 1995b) 348\u00ad50).  This  temple  was  preceded  by  a  smaller  temple  built of  wood  and  clay  c. 630\u00ad620  (Voyatzis  ( 1990)  34).  (b)  At  Ag. Elias,  on  the  border  with  (presumably)  Peraitheis,  a  large temple  dates  from  c. 500  (Fors\u00e9n  et al.( 1999)). Fors\u00e9n  and  Fors\u00e9n  ( 1997)  176  estimate  that  the  urban population  could  have  been  max. 2,000\u00ad3,000.  The  total population  of  the  polis  is  estimated  at  2,500\u00ad3,500  at  the most.  It  is  impossible  to  give  any  estimate  of  the  number  of adult  male  citizens. Asea  was  a  Mainalian  city  (Paus. 8.27.3;  Nielsen  ( 1996a) 132\u00ad34).  Membership  of  the  Arkadian  Confederacy  can  be assumed,  both  on  the  basis  of  Xen.  Hell. 6.5.11,  where  the  city is  described  as  the  rallying  place  of  the  federal  army  in  370, and  because  the  Mainalians  as  such  were  members  of  the Confederacy  (IG v.21.16  ( 360s));  membership  of  the Peloponnesian  League  may  also  be  assumed,  probably  medi- ated  by  the  Mainalian  tribal  state  (Nielsen  ( 1996c)  87,  100). According  to  Paus. 8.27.3,  Asea  was  among  the  commun- ities  that  the  Arkadian  Confederacy  voted  to  relocate  to Megalopolis  (no. 282);  however,  it  is  not  known  whether  this relocation  was  ever  wholly  or  partly  carried  out  (Moggi ( 1974)  87\u00ad88). Asea  was  centred  on  a  fortified acropolis r ising  to  54  m and  measuring  240 120  m.  The  fortification may be C 4e (Fors\u00e9n  and  Fors\u00e9n  ( 1997)  169;  Fors\u00e9n  et al.( 2002)  96); Fors\u00e9n  et al.( 2002)  100  suggest  that  a  temple  was  erected  on the  acropolis  during  the  late  Archaic\u00adClassical  (?)  period. The  lower  city  was  fortified t oo,  but  the  wall  here  seems  to  be later  than  the  acropolis  wall,  probably  C 3  (Fors\u00e9n  et al. ( 2002)  96;  Fors\u00e9n  and  Fors\u00e9n  ( 1997)  167\u00ad68;  Holmberg ( 1944)  132\u00ad42);  it  probably  enclosed  all  of  the  lower  city. Fors\u00e9n  and  Fors\u00e9n  ( 1997)  166\u00ad67  and  Fors\u00e9n  et al.( 2002) 100\u00ad2  report  that  they  found  Archaic  and  Classical  pottery around  the  acropolis,  and  that  the  area  yielding  finds was at least 13  ha,  but  perhaps  twice  as  large  (the  eastern  area  of  the site  having  been  covered  with  alluvium  brought  down by the river  Alpheios).  The  area  inside  the  lower  wall  was  built  up for  habitation;  some  of  the  houses  contained  Hellenistic finds,  but  others  contained  nothing  and  may  possibly  be older  (Fors\u00e9n  and  Fors\u00e9n  ( 1997)  169). 268.

Skillous  is--presumably--repeatedly  referred  to  as  a polis  in  the  political  sense  in  IvO 16  (c. 450\u00ad425)  (for  which see  Koerner  ( 1993)  no. 44  at 130  and  Roy  ( 1997)  296).  Xen. Hell. 6.5.2  describes  Skillous  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense too,  and  Xen.  An. 5.3.7\u00ad8  twice  uses  about  the inhabitants.  The  city-ethnic  is  found  in  the  external  collec- tive use  in  IvO 16  and  Xen.  Hell. 6.5.2;  Paus. 6.22.4  provides an  instance  referring  to  C 6f. In C 5s  Skillous  was  presumably  a  perioikic  community  of Elis  (no. 251)  (Roy  ( 1997)  283\u00ad85);  if  so,  it  must  have  been  lib- erated  from  Eleian  rule  by  the  peace  treaty  concluded  by Sparta  (no. 345)  and  Elis  after  their  war  in  C 5l\u00adC4e  (for which  see  Xen.  Hell. 3.2.23\u00ad31),  and  it  may  have  joined  the new  Triphylian  Federation  and  through  it  the  Arkadian Confederacy  (Nielsen  ( 1997)  152\u00ad54);  a  board  of  officials (damiorgoi)  is  attested  for  C 5m  (IvO 16;Koerner ( 1993)  130). However,  not  much  is  known  about  the  history  of  Skillous in  C 4e,  apart  from  the  fact  that  Xenophon  lived  there; according  to An. 5.3.7,  he  was  settled  there  by  the  Lakedaimonians  (   \u00b5  ),  but  it  is  not  clear  how  the  Lakedaimonians could  grant  land  in  a  foreign  polis  unless  they  did  so  with Skillountian  acceptance  and  collaboration  (cf.  Hunt  ( 1998) 174).  Skillous  may  have  granted  citizenship  to  Xenophon:  in An. 5.3.10  he  refers  to his  own  sons  and  those  of     which  seems  to  indicate  that  Xenophon  too  was  a triphylia  545 citizen;  if  so,  it  may  be  suggested  that  he  served  as  proxenos  of the  Lakedaimonians  at  Skillous,  since  at  Diog.

Hell. 3.2.20,25  and 30  that  by  C 5l (at  the  latest)  Epitalion  was  a  perioikic  community  of  Elis (no. 251)  (cf.  Roy  ( 1997)  283\u00ad85).  During  the  war  between Sparta  (no. 345)  and  Elis  c. 400  Epitalion  seceded  from  Elis and  joined  Sparta  (Xen.  Hell. 3.2.25).  The  Spartans  placed  a garrison  and  a  harmost  in  the  city  with  some  Eleian  refugees after  the  second  Spartan  invasion  of  Elis  (Xen.  Hell. 3.2.29). According  to  Xen.

Lepreon  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Hdt. 4.148.4 and  Aristotle  (Heracl.  Lemb. 42;  Arist.  no. 99,  Gigon)  and  in the  political  sense  by  Thuc. 5.31.5.  The  city-ethnic  is  attested epigraphically  in  the  external  collective  use  on  the  Serpent Column  (ML  27.11)  and  in  IG v.21.20  ( 360s);  in  literature  it is  found  at  Hdt. 9.28.4,Thuc.5.31  quater,Xen.

The  territory  of  Lepreon  is  described  as  in  Ps.- Skylax 44,  and  as  by Thuc. 5.31.2,  3.  Sometime  before  the Peloponnesian  War  the  city  ceded  half  its  territory  to  the Eleians  as  part  of  a  treaty  of  symmachia  and  now  had  to  pay 1  tal.  (presumably  each  year)  for  the  right  to  exploit  this  part of  the  territory (Thuc. 5.31.2;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 164).  According to Strabo 8.3.30,  Lepreon  at  some  point  absorbed  Pylos  by synoecism  (Moggi,  Sin. 168  proposes  a  date  c. 460;  cf. Demand  ( 1990)  64).  There  were a  number  of  second-order settlements  in  the  territory  of  Lepreon:  one  was  associated with  a  large  temple  at  Prasidaki  (see  infra)  unless  this  was  in fact  Pyrgos  (no. 310),  as  suggested  by  Arapogianni  ( 1999) 168,itself  a  polis  (infra).  East  of  modern  Tholo  is  a  settlement which  existed  from  the  Archaic  period  (Yalouris  ( 1973)  158; cf.  Pritchett  ( 1989)  75;  M\u00fcller  ( 1987)  839\u00ad40).  At modern Kakovatos  Classical  sherds  are  reported  by  Yalouris  ( 1973) 164.At 5.49.1,  Thucydides  mentions  a  teichos  called  Phyrkon which  must  have  been  in  Lepreatan  territory  (see  HCT  ad loc.).  A  fortress  that  is  a  possible  candidate  for  Strabo's   ( 8.3.21)  is  briefly discussed b y  Pritchett  ( 1989)  61\u00ad62;  it  may have  existed  in  the  Classical  period.  A  temple  by  the  river Neda,  at  modern  Prasidaki,  is  thought  to  have  belonged  to Lepreon  (Pritchett  ( 1989)  60  n. 138;see,  however, Arapogianni  ( 1999)  168,  suggesting  that  Prasidaki  was  in  fact Pyrgos).  It was  a  monumental  Doric  limestone  temple  of  the late  Classical  period;  it  had  an  Archaic  predecessor;  the votives  at  the  site  go  back  to  C 7m  and,  according  to  Yalouris, there  was  an      \u00b5  associated  with the  temple,  which  thus  was  perhaps  situated  in  a  second- order  settlement  of  Lepreon  (Yalouris  ( 1971);  cf.  Yalouris ( 1973)  155,  reporting  remains  of  a  wall  and  many  buildings). The  temple  was  dedicated  to  Athena  Agorios  (Arapogianni ( 1999),  who  interprets  the  epithet  as  equivalent  to  Agoraios). Lepreon provided 200  hoplites  for  the  battle  of  Plataiai  in 479  (Hdt. 9.28.4),  but  this  is  the  only  indication  we have for the  order  of  size  of  the  population. Lepreon  was  a  member  of  the  Hellenic  League  against Persia  (ML  27.11;  Hdt. 9.28.4);  in  C 5s  the  city  was  a  perioikic triphylia  543 community  of  Elis  (cf.  Hdt. 4.148.4;Xen.  Hell. 3.2.23,  25; Paus. 3.8.3;  Roy ( 1997)  283\u00ad85).  The  city  was  briefly liberated from  Eleian  rule  by  Sparta  (no. 345)  in  421  and  received  a Spartan  garrison  (Thuc. 5.31.4;  cf. 5.34.1;  Roy ( 1998);  Hunt ( 1998)  174;  Falkner  ( 1999));  however,  the  city  was  recon- quered  by Elis  (no. 251)  before  the  end  of  C 5  (cf.  Xen.  Hell. 3.2.23,  25),  but  must  have  been  liberated  again  by  the  peace treaty  concluded  between  Elis  and  Sparta  c. 400  (Roy  ( 1997) 291).  Nothing  is  known  with  certainty  about  the  position  of Lepreon  in  the  united  Triphylian  state  of  c. 400\u00ad369,but it was  probably  the  central  city  of  Triphylia,  since  it  seems  that Lepreon  represented  Triphylia  in  the  Arkadian  Confederacy of  which  it  is  securely  attested  as  a  member  (IG v.21.20 ( 360s);  Nielsen  ( 1997)  153\u00ad54). Nothing  is  known about  the  form  of  constitution,  but there  was  an  Aristotelian  treatise  on  the  politeia  of  Lepreon; the  only  surviving  fragment  attests  to the  existence  of  laws on  adultery,  on  atimia  and  on  admission  to  citizenship (Heracl.  Lemb. 42;  Arist.  no. 99,  Gigon). Lepreon  was  situated  on  a  steep  hill  north  of  modern Lepreo  (formerly  Strovitzi),  c. 7  km  from  the  coast.  The acropolis  was  fortified;  the  remains  are  mostly  of  the Hellenistic  period,  but  an  earlier  phase  may  be  C 4  (PECS  s.v. Lepreon, 499).  On  the  acropolis  was  a  Doric  temple  of Demeter  dating  to  c. 375\u00ad350;  it  was  without  sculptural  orna- mentation  but  had  a  predecessor  (Knell  ( 1979),  ( 1983)). The  lower  city  was  fortified t oo  (Pritchett  ( 1989)  60),  but the  wall  has  not  been  dated.  The  extent  of  the  lower  city  was considerable,  according  to Frazer  ( 1898)  iii. 474  (cf.  Pritchett ( 1989)  59).  Heracl.  Lemb. 42  refers  to an  agora. In  the  Classical  period,  Lepreon  may  have  produced  as many  as  seven  Olympic  victors:  Olympionikai 267  (c. 460); nos. 276,  309  (c.C 5m);  no. 331  ( 424);  no. 338  ( 420);  no. 360 (c. 400);  no. 405  (c. 376);  no. 426  (c. 360).  Furthermore, Antiochos  (Olympionikai 360)  was  victorious  in  the  pen- tathlon  twice  in  both  the  Isthmian  Games  (cf.  Nielsen, Lepreon)  and  the  Nemean  Games. 307.

The  external  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  SEG 35  389.2\u00ad3  (c. 399\u00ad369)  and  at  Xen.  Hell. 3.2.25;Paus.  6.22.4 provides  an  instance  referring  to C 6f.  The  external  individual use  is  found  in  Xen.  An. 7.4.16  (  ). It  is  likely  that  the  city  controlled  the  sanctuary  of Poseidon  Samios  at  Samikon  (Strabo  8.3.13;  B\u00f6lte  ( 1930) 777\u00ad78;  Tausend  ( 1992)  19\u00ad21). In C 5s  (at  the  latest)  Makiston  was  a  perioikic  commun- ity  of  Elis  (cf.  Hdt. 4.148.4  and  Xen.  Hell. 3.2.23,25;  Roy ( 1997) 283\u00ad85);  in  the  period  c. 400\u00ad369  Makiston  was  a  member  of the  Triphylian  federation  (SEG 35  389  (c. 399\u00ad369)),  an organisation  that  was  capable  of  granting  Makistian  citizen- ship  to foreigners  (SEG 35  389;  cf.  Nielsen  ( 1997)  149);  mag- istracies  ( ) and a nomos  are  attested  for  C 4f  (ibid.;  cf. Siewert  ( 1987)  276).  The  city  presumably  joined  the Arkadian  Confederacy  with  the  rest  of  Triphylia  c. 369  at  the latest  (Nielsen  ( 1997)  152\u00ad55). Makiston  was  presumably  situated  at  modern  M\u00e1zi (Pritchett  ( 1989)  65;  followed  by Barr.);  this  site  was  a  large town  and  there  are  remains  of  houses  and  probably  of  public buildings  (Trianti  ( 1985)  22).  Two  burial  areas  of  C 4  have  been excavated  (ibid.);  the  acropolis  was  fortified ( Trianti  ( 1985)  21; Pritchett  ( 1989)  68)  and  contained  a  Doric  peripteral  temple, probably  of  C 5e  (Trianti  ( 1985)  23\u00ad24);  the  temple  was  pre- sumably  dedicated  to Athena  (ibid. 24\u00ad33).  After  c. 400\u00ad369 (SEG 35  389)  the  city  is  mentioned  as  existing  only  once  (AR ( 1996\u00ad97)  49  (C 3)),  and  it  is  absent  from  Polybios'  list  of Triphylian  cities  at  4.77.9;it  may  have  ceased  to  exist  by  219,the date  to  which  Polybios'  description  of  Triphylia  refers. 308.

Hell. 7.4.14).A  loca- tion  between  modern  Floka  and  Strefi  west  of  Olympia  has been  suggested  (KlPauly  iii. 1020),  but  the  site  with  Classical material  at  Salmoni  (formerly  Koukoura)  (McDonald  and Hope  Simpson  ( 1972)  304\u00ad5  no. 308:  see  also  ibid. 320\u00ad21  no. 722)  would  suit  well. It  is  called  a  (perioikic)  polis  in  the  political  sense  at  Xen. Hell. 3.2.23\u00ad25,30.The  external  collective  use  of  the  city-eth- nic  is  found  in  Xen.  Hell. 3.2.25,  4.2.16. When  Marganeis  became  perioikic  is  not  known:  it  was certainly  perioikic  by  the  Eleian\u00adSpartan  war  of  c. 400,  after which  it  became  independent  (Xen.  Hell. 3.2.25,  30).  It then probably  joined  the  Peloponnesian  League.  It  sent  troops  to support  Sparta  (no. 345)  in  394  (Xen.  Hell. 4.2.16).  In  371/0 Elis  (no. 251)  claimed  that  Marganeis  should  belong  to  Elis (Xen.  Hell. 6.5.2);  it  was  Eleian  by  365,  when  it  was  captured by  Arkadia  (Xen.  Hell. 7.4.14;Diod.  15.77.4),  but  was  soon recaptured  by  Elis  (Xen.  Hell. 7.4.26).  It was  probably  forti- fied;  Xen.  Hell. 7.4.14  notes  that  it  was  captured  because  of treachery,  and  Strabo  8.3.24  says  that  it  was  not  a  natural stronghold,  implying  man-made  defences.  In  Strabo's  day (ibid.)  it  was  part  of  Amphidolia  (no. 247). 260.  (Metapioi) Map 58.  Unlocated,  not  in  Barr.Type:  B. The  toponym  is  not  attested.  The  city-ethnic  is  , known only  from  IvO 10  (c. 475\u00ad450),  where  the  collective and  external  use  is  attested  in  a  50-year  treaty  of  friendship with  the  equally  unknown  Anaitoi  (no. 248)  (cf.  Minon ( 1994)  no. 10;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 111).  Since  the  treaty  is  in  Eleian dialect,  both  Anaitoi  and  Metapioi  presumably  belong  to  the region  of  Elis,  but  may  have  been  located  anywhere  in  the region,  either  within  the  Eleian  state  proper  or  in  perioikic territory  north  or  south  of  the  river  Alpheios.  The  collective use  of  the  city-ethnic  and  the  capacity  to  enter  into  a  treaty with  another  community  strongly  suggest  that  the  Metapioi were  a  polis.  On  the  difficulty of  identifying  the  Classical community  with  the  Mycenaean  Me-ta-pa,  see  Roy  ( 1997) 313\u00ad14.  Cf.  Anaitoi  (no. 248). 261.

Letrinoi  lay  120  stades  from  Olympia  and  180  from  Elis (no. 251)  on  the  Olympia\u00adElis  road  through  the  plain  (Paus. elis  499 6.22.8);  locations  near  modern  Ag.

Ioannis  (Pirgos:  BCH 108 ( 1984)  Chron. 770  and  McDonald  and  Hope  Simpson  ( 1972) 320\u00ad21  no. 717;  Ag.  Ioannis:  ibid. 302\u00ad3  no. 306). It  is  described  as  a  (perioikic)  polis  in  the  political  sense  at Xen.  Hell. 3.2.23,  30.  The  external  collective city-ethnic  is used  on  a  C 6s  dedication  at  Olympia  (Siewert  ( 1991)  no. 9), and  by  Xen.  Hell. 3.2.25  and 4.2.16  ((r 394)  for  a  military  con- tingent).  When  Letrinoi  became  perioikic  is  not  known:  it was  certainly  perioikic  by  the  Eleian\u00adSpartan  war  of  c. 400.It then  became  independent  (Xen.  Hell. 3.2.25,  30)  and  proba- bly  joined  the  Peloponnesian  League,  sending  troops (sphendonetai)  to support  Sparta  (no. 345)  in  394  (Xen.  Hell. 4.2.16).  Elis  probably  recovered  it  by c. 362  (cf.  Xen.  Hell. 6.5.2 with  Tuplin  ( 1993)  183\u00ad85).  Paus. 6.22.8  says  that  it  was  orig- inally  a  polisma,  but  in  his  day  had  only  a  few  buildings  with a  temple  and  statue  of  Artemis  Alpheiaia.  According  to  Lyc. Alex. 53\u00ad55,  the  bones  of  Pelops  were at  Letrina.  Letreus,  son of  Pelops,  was  oecist  of  Letrinoi  (Paus. 6.22.8). 259.

Hell. 3.2.27,  7.4.14;  Ps.-Skylax 43)  and  in  the  political  sense  (Hdt. 8.73.2;  Thuc. 5.47.3  (cf.  IG i\u00b3  83);  Gorgias  fr. 10  (  Arist.  Rh. 1416a1\u00ad4);  Pl.

There  was  an  Aristotelian  politeia  of  the Eleians  (Heracl.  Lemb. 21;  Arist.  frr. 499\u00ad500);  cf.  Plut.  Adv. Col. 1126C  (reform  of  the  politeia  of  the  Eleians  by  Plato's pupil  Phormio)  and  Arist.  Pol. 1306a16\u00ad19  (politeia  as  con- duct  of  state  business  among  the  Eleians).  Asty  is  used  of  the town  Elis  by  Xen.  Hell. 3.2.26,  7.4.32  (cf. 3.2.27:  ). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  internally  in Siewert  ( 1991)  no. 4  (C 6l)  and  on  C 6l\u00adC5  coins  (infra)  and externally  in  ML  27.9  ( 479\u00ad478);  Hecat.  fr. 25.2;  Hdt. 4.148.4; Thuc. 1.27.2.  The  individual  use  is  found  internally  in  IvO 271  LSAG  no. 19  (c. 450\u00ad425?)  and  externally  in  Hdt. 5.45.2; Pl.  Ap. 19E;  Dem. 18.295;  IG ii\u00b2  8528  (C 4e);  IG vii  414.22\u00ad23, 25\u00ad26  (C 4m);  and  IG ii\u00b2  3827  (C 4m).  Elis  is  implicitly described  as  patris  at  Dem. 18.291\u00ad92  (cf.  Hdt. 6.127.1\u00ad4 implicitly  describing  it  as  patre). The  territory was  called  (already  in  Hom.  Il 2.615; also  Hdt. 6.70.2;  Thuc. 2.66.1),  and  also  '  (Hdt. 4.30.1; Thuc. 2.25.3).    was  used  for  the  area  of  the  val- ley  of  the  river  Peneios  (first b y  Thuc. 2.25.3),  believed  to be the  area  originally  controlled  by  the  Eleians  (cf.  Arist.  fr. 500).  The  territory  was  at  least  sometimes  understood  as including  perioikic  areas:  Thuc. 5.34.1,  putting  Lepreon  (no. 306)  on  the  border  of  Lakonike  and  Eleia,  must  include  in Eleia  at  least  Triphylia  north  of  Lepreon,  if  not  Lepreon itself;  and  Diod. 14.17.8  (r 400)  apparently  includes  Lasion (no. 256)  in  Elis.  There  is,  however,  no  reason  to  suppose  that perioikic  territory  was  formally  incorporated  into  the Eleian  state  proper  in  the  Classical  period  (Roy  ( 1997) 297\u00ad98;  cf.  Roy  ( 1999)). Apart  from  the  town of  Elis,  there  were numerous  other settlements  in  Eleia,  including  urban  sites,  though  their  sta- tus  is  often  not  clear.  Within  the  Eleian  state  proper Alasyaion  (no. 245),  Kyllene  (no. 254)  and  Pylos  (no. 263) may  have  been  (dependent)  poleis,  while  other  settlements are  reliably  or  plausibly  reported  especially  at  Harpina, Herakleia  and  Salmone  (all  in  Pisatis),  and  at  Hyrmine, Myrtountion  and  Pheia.  There  was  also  the  sanctuary  at Olympia,  run  by  Elis  at  least  from  C 6.  Elis  also  controlled perioikic  communities  north  of  the  river  Alpheios  at Amphidolia  (no. 247),  Letrinoi  (no. 258),  Marganeis  (no. 259),  Lasion  (no. 256)  and  (in  Akroreia)  Alion  (no. 246), Eupagion  (no. 252),Opous  (no. 261)  and  Thraistos  (no. 264), besides  numerous  perioikic  communities  in  Triphylia  south of  the  Alpheios  (on  which  see  Nielsen,  in  this  volume 540\u00ad46). There  is  very  limited  evidence  on  population  size: 3,000 hoplites  from  Elis  are  recorded  in  418  (Thuc. 5.58.1,  75.5)  and 3,000  jointly  from  Elis,  Triphylia,  Akroreia  and  Lasion  in  394 (Xen.  Hell. 4.2.16). Though  there  is  no  hard  evidence  of  a  Spartan\u00adEleian alliance  before  the  Persian  Wars  (Hdt. 8.72,  9.77.3;  Paus. 5.4.7),Elis  may  have  been  among  the  earliest  members  of  the Peloponnesian  League  (Tausend  ( 1992)  167);  membership lasted  till  Elis  quarrelled  with  Sparta  (no. 345)  over  Lepreon in 420  (Thuc. 5.31.1\u00ad5,  34.1).  War  between  Sparta  and  Elis c. 400  (Roy  ( 1997)  283\u00ad84,  299\u00ad304)  was  ended  by  a  treaty under  which  Elis  evidently  rejoined  the  Peloponnesian League,  since  it  is  seen  as  Sparta's  ally  in  394  (Xen.  Hell. 4.2.16),  382  (Diod. 15.31.2)  and  374  (Xen.  Hell. 6.2.3).  Elis' membership  of  the  League  finally ended in the aftermath of Leuktra  (Roy  ( 1994)).  C. 500  Elis  made  a  treaty,  for  100  years and  agreeing  inter  alia  mutual  military  support,  with  the otherwise  unknown  Ewaoioi  (no. 253)  (IvO 9),  in  which  Elis was  the  superior  partner  (Roy  ( 1998)  367\u00ad68;  Roy and Schofield ( 1999)).  Treaties  of  symmachia  with  Corinth  (no. 227),  Argos  (no. 347)  and  Lepreon  (no. 306)  are  mentioned at  Thuc. 5.31.1;  Elis  formed  a  major  alliance  in  420\u00ad418  with Athens  (no. 361),  Argos  (no. 347)  and  Mantinea  (no. 281) (Thuc. 5.47;  IG i\u00b3  83),  and  in  370  an  alliance  with  Arkadia, Argos  (no. 347)  and  Thebes  (no. 221)  (Diod. 15.62.3;Dem. 16.12,  19\u00ad20;  see  Roy  ( 1994)  190),  which  broke  down when Elis  and  Arkadia  went  to  war  in  365  (Xen.  Hell. 7.4.12;Diod. 15.77.1\u00ad2).  IG ii\u00b2  112  ( 362/1)  records  a  treaty  of  symmachia between  Elis  and  Athens  (no. 361),  Arkadia,  Achaia  and Phleious  (no. 355).  Elis  was  a  member  of  the  League  of Corinth  set  up  by  Philip  II  in  338\u00ad337  (cf.  RO  76;  Hammond and  Griffith ( 1979)  623\u00ad46). A  supposed  early  synoecism  of  Elis  (Paus. 5.4.3)  by  Oxylos seems  unhistorical  (so  rightly  Moggi,  Sin. 160).  In  471  (Diod. 11.54.1),  \"after  the  Persian  Wars\"  (Strabo  8.3.2),  the  Eleians were  synoecised  ( ,  both  authors).  Diodorus says  the  Eleians  were  synoecised  from  numerous  small  poleis into  one;  Strabo  that  they  had  previously  lived  \u00b5, elis  495 and  then  came  together  into  the  polis  Elis  from  many  demoi. Strabo  also  says  that  the  Eleians  were  synoecised  from  the perioikides,  a  term  presumably  used  in  a  purely  local  sense, not  suggesting  that  subordinate  perioikic  communities  were incorporated  (Roy  ( 1997)  285\u00ad89).  There  may  be  other  refer- ences  to  this  synoecism  in  Ps.-Skylax  43  (a in  Elis)  and  in  Leandr(i)os  (FGrHist 492)  fr. 13  (Eleians  lived in  komai  and  were  then  gathered  into  one  polis).  The  ancient sources  do  not  clarify  the  nature  of  the  synoecism  (Moggi, Sin. 157\u00ad66;  Roy ( 1997)  286\u00ad89,(2002b)).  A  unitary  Eleian state  certainly  existed  before  471,  as  did  the  town  Elis  (Eder and  Mitsopoulos  ( 1999);  see  also  Yalouris  ( 1994)  on  the  town in  the  Archaic  period  and  later).  Political  restructuring  with- in  Elis  may  have  accompanied  the  synoecism:  see  Gehrke, Stasis 55,  365\u00ad67;  but  note  the  scepticism  of  Walter  ( 1993)  118 and  n. 19,124  and  n. 55.Strabo's  report  ( 8.3.15)  that  Hypana  in Triphylia  was  synoecised  into  Elis  must--if  accurate--refer to  a  period  after  C 3  (Moggi,  Sin. 164  n. 18). The  following  Eleian  refugees  are  attested:  commanders exiled  during  the  Persian  Wars  (Hdt. 9.77.3);  oligarchs,  after a  failed  oligarchic  coup  c. 400  (Xen.  Hell. 3.2.27\u00ad29:  cf.  Paus. 3.8.4\u00ad5);  democrats  driven  out  of  the  town of  Elis  in  365 (Xen.  Hell. 7.4.16,  26);  Eleians  exiled  by  oligarchs  in  343 (Dem. 19.260,  294;  Paus. 4.28.4,  5.4.9;Diod.  16.63.4\u00ad5;  cf. Dem. 9.27  and 18.295);  and  pro-Makedonian  exiles  restored after  Alexander  overcame  Thebes  in  335  (Arr.  Anab. 1.10.1: presumably  exiled  when  Elis  tried  to  leave  the  League  of Corinth  on  the  death  of  Philip  (Diod. 17.3.5,  cf. 17.8.5)). C. 350(?)  a  law  was  passed  (supplementing  an  earlier  text) about  the  return  of  exiles  and  the  treatment  of  their  relatives and  property (DGE 424).  In  365  there  were  Arkadian  exiles in  Elis  (Diod. 15.77.1). Elis  took  part  in  the  Persian  Wars  (ML  27.9;  cf.  Hdt. 8.72.3, 9.77.3).Eleian  hoplite  contingents  are  recorded  in  418  (Thuc. 5.58.1)  and  394  (Xen.  Hell. 4.2.16);  300  logades  are  mentioned by Thuc. 2.25.4;  300  was  also  the  number  of  the  special  guard which  is  attested  in  C 4  (Xen.  Hell. 7.4.13,  16,  31)  and  whose commander  is  mentioned  at  Xen.  Hell. 7.4.31  (Pritchett ( 1974)  223).  Commanders  (hegemones)  are  mentioned  at Hdt. 9.77.A hipparchos  is  attested  at  Xen.  Hell. 7.4.19,  and hippeis  are  mentioned  at  Hell. 7.4.16,  26.  An  Eleian  navy  is mentioned  or  implied  by  Thuc. 1.27.2,  46.1,  2.9.3  (cf.  Diod. 14.34.1);  it  was  presumably  served  by  the  harbours  at  Pheia (Thuc. 2.25.4)  and  Kyllene  ( 2.84.5).  The  Eleian  Teutiaplos was  evidently  a  commander  in  the  Peloponnesian  fleet in  427 (Thuc. 3.29.2). An  Eleian  embassy  went  to  Corinth  (no. 227)  and  then Argos  (no. 347)  in  421  (Thuc. 5.31.1,  cf. 5.44.2);  for  Eleian diplomatic  activity  cf.  Hippias'  claims  to  be  preferred  as ambassador  (Pl.  Hp.  mai. 281A)  and  Hdt. 2.160.1  and  Xen. Hell. 7.1.38.  A  quarrel  between  Elis  and  Lepreon  (no. 306) was  arbitrated  by  Sparta  (no. 345),  but  Elis  refused  to  accept the  verdict  (Thuc. 5.31.3;Roy ( 1998)).In  C 5f,Elis  itself  passed a  verdict  in  a  case  of  unknown  nature,  involving  Athens  (no. 361),  Thespiai  (no. 222),  the  Boiotians  and  the  Thessalians (SEG 26  475,  31  358). The  earliest  award  of  proxeny  by  Elis  (with  a  guarantor)  is recorded  by  an  unpublished  inscription  of  c. 550\u00ad500 (Marek  ( 1984)  23;Taeuber ( 1991)  112).An  inscription  of  C 5m records  an  award  of  citizenship  (Taita  ( 2001)  57\u00ad60).  If  the Chaladrians  (no. 249)  were  a  community  within  Elis  proper, the  award  of  Chaladrian  citizenship  (IvO 11  (c. 500\u00ad475); Minon  ( 1994)  no. 9)  presumably  made  the  recipient  an Eleian  citizen;  but  the  Chaladrians  may  have  been  perioikic. Elis  announced  the  holding  of  the  Olympic  Games,  and the  beginning  of  the  Olympic  truce  (Rougemont  ( 1973); Jameson  et al.( 1993);  cf.  Thuc. 5.49.1\u00ad4).  An  unpublished inscription  of  C 5m  records  an  award  of  citizenship  and  the- orodokia  (Taeuber ( 1991)  112).  The  Tenedian  honorand  of IvO 39  (C 3  or  C 2e)  was  hereditary  theorodokos  of  Elis,  and entertained  theoroi.  It  may  have  been  Elis  which  developed the  system  of  theorodokia  (Perlman  ( 2000)  18\u00ad20),  naturally in  order  to  facilitate  the  epangelia  for  the  Olympics.  Hippias of  Elis  dated  the  first Olympic Games t o  776,  but  archaeo- logical  evidence  suggests  that  the  Games  gained  major popularity  only  from  C 8l  (Morgan  ( 1990)  26\u00ad56).  Besides that  of  Zeus,  numerous  other  cults  developed  at  the  sanctu- ary  of  Olympia  (Paus. 5.15.3\u00ad10).  There  was  also  an  impor- tant  oracle  of  Zeus  (Jacquemin  ( 1999\u00ad2002),  hereafter  J.)  on Paus. 5.13.11).  The  first t emple  at  Olympia  was  that  of  Hera (c. 600)  (J.  on  Paus. 5.16.1),  followed  by  the  temple  of  Zeus  in the  second  quarter  of  C 5  (J.  on  Paus. 5.10.2\u00ad12.8).  No  earlier than  C 5  the  shrine  of  Pelops  (Pelopion)  was  surrounded  by a  hexagonal  enclosure,  and  a  monumental  porch  was  added in  C 4  (J.  on  Paus. 5.13.1).The  last  temple  built  in  the  Altis  was the  Metr\u00f6on  (C 5l)  (J.  on  Paus. 5.20.9).  All  these  buildings stood  within  the  defined sacred area,  the  Altis  (see  J.  on  Paus. 5.10.1).  On  a  terrace  north  of  the  Altis  twelve  (?)  treasuries were  built  by different  Greek  poleis  to store  offerings:  the earliest  was  that  of  Gela  (no. 17)  (c. 600),  while  others belonged  to  Megara  (no. 225),  Metapontion  (no. 61), Selinous  (no. 44),  Kyrene  (no. 1028),  Sybaris  (no. 70), Byzantion  (no. 674),  Epidamnos  (no. 79),  Syracuse  (no. 47), Sikyon  (no. 228)  and  an  unknown  state  (J.  on  Paus. 6.19.1\u00ad15; there  are  difficulties r econciling  Pausanias  and  the  archaeo- logical  findings).  Two  buildings  were  built  close  to  each 496 roy other  south  of  the  Altis,  the  older  c. 550\u00ad500  and  the  other C 5e,  and  they  were  joined  by  further  construction  in  C 4; they  have been  identified as the bouleuterion,  though  it  has been  doubted  whether  that  was  their  original  function (Gneisz  ( 1990)  340\u00ad1;  J.  on  Paus. 5.23.1;  note  the  reservations of  Morgan  and  Coulton  ( 1997)  112\u00ad13).  North  of  the  Altis  a prytaneion  was  constructed  in  C 5e  (Miller  ( 1978)  86\u00ad91, 235\u00ad239).  The  original  stadion  was  moved  east  out  of  the Altis  by  C 6m,  and  developed  and  extended  later  (Mallwitz ( 1988)).  Classical  Greeks  believed  in  early  conflict between Elis  and  Pisatis  for  control  of  Olympia,  but  it  is  difficult t o construct  a  reliable  narrative  from  the  surviving  accounts:  at any  rate  Elis  effectively  controlled  Olympia  by  some  time  in C 6.  Both  the  town  of  Elis  and  the  Olympic  sanctuary  served as  political  centres  for  the  polis  Elis  from  the  C 6  onwards. Various  Elean  officials (e.g.  the  hellanodikai)  carried  out duties  at  both  places,  and  their  duties  concerning  the  sanc- tuary  and  the  Games  overlapped  with  their  other  responsi- bilities  (Minon  ( 1994)  ii. 508\u00ad9;  Roy ( 1999)  159,(2002b)  257). The  use  of  both  Elis  and  Olympia  for  political  purposes made  the  Elean  polis  remarkably  bicentral.  The  sanctuary, though  under  Elean  control  and  sometimes  exploited  by Elis  (Roy  ( 1998)),  attracted  Greeks  from  other  communities in  large  numbers,  and  received  a  multitude  of  dedications (described  by  Paus.)  from  both  individuals  and  poleis, including  armour  and  weapons  dedicated  to  celebrate  vic- tory  in  war.  Texts  of  documents  such  as  inter-state  treaties were  displayed  there,  and  the  large  gatherings  at  the  Games were  an  occasion  for  political  speeches  and  pronounce- ments  to  the  Greek  world.  The  sanctuary's  Panhellenic  character  of  course  made  control  all  the  more  valuable  to Elis. As  civic  subdivisions,  twelve  phylai  are  attested  in  368.The number  was  reduced  to  eight  in  364  because  of  territory  lost in  war  with  Arkadia  (Paus. 5.9.4\u00ad6),  and  apparently remained  at  eight  (Paus. 5.16.7).  See  Jones,  POAG 142\u00ad45, and  Roy  ( 1997)  297\u00ad98. The  form  of  constitution  changed  several  times  in  Elis (Gehrke,  Stasis 52\u00ad57,  365\u00ad67;  cf.  Bultrighini  ( 1990)).  In  C 6 an  extreme  oligarchy  was  largely  controlled  by  a  few  families (Arist.  Pol. 1306a13\u00ad19),  though  probably  later  became  more moderate  (but,  pace  Gehrke,  the  Chaladrian  decree  IvO 11 may  not  be  directly  relevant).  Elis  then  became  democratic, possibly  in  the  synoecism  of 471  (Diod. 11.54.1;Strabo 8.3.2), and--despite an attempted oligarchic coup d'\u00e9tat  c. 400 (Xen.  Hell. 3.2.27\u00ad29;  cf.  Paus. 3.8.4\u00ad5)--retained democrat- ic  constitutional  forms  until  365,  when  oligarchs  took  con- trol  (Xen.  Hell. 7.4.15\u00ad16).  Reconciliation  between  oligarchs and  democrats  (DGE 24)  may  be  dated  c. 350,  and  may  have been  followed  by  constitutional  reform  by  Plato's  pupil Phormio  (Plut.  Adv.  Col. 1206C).  Probably  in  343  there  was an  oligarchic  coup  d'\u00e9tat  (Dem. 19.260,  294;  Paus. 4.28.4, 5.4.9;Diod.16.63.4\u00ad5;  cf.  Dem. 9.27  and 18.295).After  Philip's death  Elis  tried  to  break  away  from  the  League  of  Corinth (Diod. 17.3.5,  cf. 17.8.5),  apparently  exiling  pro- Makedonians;  after  Alexander  overcame  Thebes,  Elis  took back  these  exiles  (Arr.  Anab. 1.10.1). On  public  enactments,  see  Minon  ( 1994)  ii. 514\u00ad16. Examples  of  laws  are  IvO 4  (Minon  ( 1994)  no. 6  (c. 500\u00ad480), law  concerning  the  theokolos);  IvO 2  (Minon  ( 1994)  no. 14 (c. 475\u00ad450),  decree  concerning  Patrias);  DGE 424  (c. 350(?), law  concerning  exiles).  Lawcourts  are  attested  in  an  inscrip- tion  of  C 6  found  at  the  town of  Elis  (Siewert  ( 1994b)  and ( 2001)).  It  is  notable  that  Olympian  Zeus  was  often  involved in  sanctions  for  offences  (e.g.  IvO 2,  3;  Minon  ( 1994)  ii. 516\u00ad26);  this  involvement  extended  to  the  treaty  with  the Ewaoioi  (no. 253)  (IvO 9;  Roy  and  Schofield ( 1999)),  and  to the  penalty  imposed  on  Sparta  (no. 345)  for  alleged  breach of  the  Olympic  truce  in  420  (Thuc. 5.49.1\u00ad50.4;Roy ( 1998)). Elis  also  held  Olympic  tribunals,  delivering  judgments  and penalties  (Thuc. 5.49.1\u00ad50.4  (cf.  Hyp.  frr. 111\u00ad12);  Siewert ( 1981);  Minon  ( 1994)  ii. 490\u00ad95;  Roy ( 1998)). As  eponymous  officials (Sherk ( 1990b)  233\u00ad34),  damior- goi  are  attested  in  IvO 17  (C 5l\u00adC4e,  number  unknown),  SEG 15  241  (C 4,two damiorgoi),  DGE 424  (C 4m,  one  damiorgos). Cf.  IvO 39  (C 3  or  C 2e),  with  eponymous  hellanodikai. On  the  boule,  see  Minon  ( 1994)  ii. 509\u00ad11.  There  was  an early  oligarchic  council  of  ninety  gerontes,  in  which  mem- bership  was  for  life,  and  election  was  dominated  by  a  few families  so  that,  even  among  the  oligarchs,  few  gained  membership  (Arist.  Pol. 1306a13\u00ad19).  By  c. 525\u00ad500  there  was a  council  of 500  (IvO 7  Minon  ( 1994)  no. 1;  cf.  reference  to a  council  in  IvO 3  Minon  ( 1994)  no. 5  (c. 500\u00ad475)), presumably  later  replaced  by the  council  of 600  found  in  420 (Thuc. 5.47.9). On  other  officials,  see  e.g.  Thuc. 5.47.9  (demiourgoi  and thesmophylakes)  and  Minon  ( 1994)  ii. 473\u00ad509.In IvO 9 (c. 500) appears  as  a  generic  term for  an  official,  as opposed  to  an  ordinary  citizen  ( ).  Officials called mastroi  had  powers  to  review  actions  of  other  magistrates (IvO 2  (c. 475\u00ad450))  and  judicial  decisions  (SEG 31  358 (c. 475\u00ad470)).  Among  other  officials the hellanodikai  were important,  but  the  development  of  the  office is not clear (Jones,  POAG 142\u00ad45  with  nn.  at  152\u00ad53;  Bultrighini  ( 1990) 146\u00ad65);  the  original  title  was  possibly  diaitater  (Ebert  and Siewert  ( 1999)).  The  administration  of  Olympic  affairs elis  497 overlapped  considerably  with  other  functions  of  Eleian  offi- cials  (Minon  ( 1994)  ii. 508\u00ad9;  Roy ( 1999)  159). On  the  assembly,  see  Minon  ( 1994)  ii. 511\u00ad13.  There  are references  to  meetings  of  an  assembly  as  damos  plethyon  in IvO 7  (  Minon  ( 1994)  no. 1  (c. 525\u00ad500))  and  3  (  Minon ( 1994)  no. 5  (c. 500\u00ad475)).There  is  a  reference  to a  decision  of the  damos  in  IvO 13  (  Minon  ( 1994)  no. 12  (c. 475\u00ad450)),and in  IvO 7  the  damos  has  power  to  take  a  definitive decision in jurisdiction. For  the  public  architecture  of  Elis,  see  the  description  of the  town  Elis  by  Paus. 6.23.1\u00ad26.3.  Architectural  fragments suggest  that  there  were  several  monumental  structures already  in  the  Archaic  period  (Yalouris,  PECS 299\u00ad300 (\"Elis\");  Eder  and  Mitsopoulos  ( 1999)  25\u00ad35).  While  at  least some  functions  of  the  state  took  place  at  the  town  Elis  by  C 6 (Siewert  ( 1994b)),  there  were  also  buildings  for  such  pur- poses  at  Olympia,  which  may  have  been  the  major  seat  of Eleian  government  in  C 6  (Hansen  and  Fischer-Hansen ( 1994)  86\u00ad89). There  was  a  bouleuterion  at  Olympia  (see  Gneisz  ( 1990) 340\u00ad41,  dating  its  first phase t o  C 6s).  On  the  C 5e  prytaneion at  Olympia,  see  Miller  ( 1978)  86\u00ad91,  235\u00ad39.  There  was  an agora  at  Elis  (Xen.  Hell. 3.2.28  (r  c. 400);  Martin  ( 1951)  311\u00ad13, cf. 241\u00ad44  on  two  areas  at  Olympia  which  he  saw  as  agoras). On  the  south  stoa  (c. 450\u00ad425)  and  the  west  stoa  (C 5  or  early C 4)  at  Elis,  see  Coulton  ( 1976)  237;  at  Olympia  there  were  the Echo  Stoa  of  c. 340\u00ad330  (Jacquemin  ( 1999\u00ad2002)  on  Paus. 5.21.17),  and  others.  At  Elis  the  temple  of  Athena  on  the acropolis  was  probably  erected  in  the  Archaic  period (Yalouris,  PECS).  The  cult  site  at  Olympia  was  already  well established  in  the  Archaic  period  (Morgan  ( 1990)  26\u00ad56; Sinn  ( 1994)  on  early  developments);  see  also  Yalouris,  PECS 646\u00ad650.  The  theatre  at  Elis  was  first built c. 300  (Glaser ( 2001);  TGR  ii. 207).On  gymnasia  at  Elis,  see  Xen.  Hell. 3.2.27 (c. 400);  on  the  gymnasion  at  Olympia,  see  Wacker  ( 1996), dating  the  first phase (p. 24)  to  C 4  or  C 3e. On  a  plan  of  settlement  in  the  town  of  Elis  from  the Classical  to  the  Roman  periods  the  area  of  settlement  is shown  as  between  4  and 5  km \u00b2,  extending  north  of  the  river Peneios  (Yalouris  ( 1972b)  141;  see  also  Yalouris  ( 1994)).  Xen. Hell. 3.2.27  says  that  c. 400  the  gymnasia  were  near  the  sub- urbs  (proastia),  but  on  Yalouris'  plan  they  are  shown  near the  centre  of  the  area  of  settlement,  which  may  have  grown after  c. 400.  The  hill  Kaloskopi  became  the  acropolis  of  Elis (Yalouris,  PECS:  cf.  Xen.  Hell. 7.4.15  (r 365)  and  Paus. 6.26.3), but  was  apparently  not  fortified until  312  (note  the  wording of  Diod. 19.87.2\u00ad3).  The  town  of  Elis  was  unwalled  c. 400 according  to  Xen.  Hell. 3.2.27  (Roy  ( 1997)  299\u00ad304).  No walls are  shown  on  Yalouris'  plan,  and  no  remains  of  walls  have been  reported  from  subsequent  archaeological  investiga- tion. The  most  important  cult  at  Elis  was  that  of  Zeus Olympios,  under  Eleian  control  at  least  from  C 6  (Siewert ( 1987\u00ad88)  7),and  Elis  organised  the  Olympic  festival  and  the Heraia  at  Olympia  (KlPauly  iv. 286\u00ad88,  ii. 1031\u00ad32).  On Eleian  victors  at  Olympia,  Delphi  and  Nemea,  see  Crowther ( 1988).  Eleians  did  not  participate  in  the  Isthmian  Games (e.g.  Paus. 5.2.2).  Communal  dedications  by  the  Eleians  at Olympia  are  attested  in  C 6  (Siewert  ( 1991b)  nos. 4\u00ad8)  and  C 4 (DGE 423);  on  the  surprising  rarity of  Eleian  dedications  at Olympia,  see  Taeuber  ( 1991)  113. Elis  had  its  own  calendar,  with  some  month  names  not known  from  elsewhere  (Samuel  ( 1972)  95\u00ad97,  284,  288,  294; Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 199\u00ad201). From C 6l  Elis  struck  silver  coinage  on  the  Aiginetan standard,  mainly  staters  but  also  smaller  denominations. From C 5l  bronze  coins  were  also  struck.  Most  coins  carried the  Eleian  city-ethnic  (or  an  abbreviation),  but  from  C 5e coins  were  also  struck  with  the  legend   (spelt  with  kappa  or  koppa),  clearly  in  connection  with Olympic  festivals.  Frequent  types  were  Olympian  Zeus  and his  attributes  (thunderbolt,  eagle),  and  also  Hera  (Head, HN \u00b2419\u00ad25;  Seltman  ( 1921)  on  silver  coinage  only;  Kraay ( 1976)  103\u00ad7;  Franke  ( 1984);  SNG  Cop.  Phliasia-Laconia 352\u00ad418).  There  is  no  reason  to  accept  Seltman's  view  that Eleian  coinage  was  essentially  a  \"temple  coinage\"  (Warren ( 1962);  Nicolet-Pierre  ( 1975)). Elis  established  four  colonies  in  southern  Epeiros: Boucheta  (no. 90),  Elateia  (no. 94),  Pandosia  (no. 104)  and Batiai  (no. 88)  (Theopomp.  fr. 206;Dem.  7.32;Strabo 7.7.5). Though  not  precisely  dated,  the  foundations  are  assigned  to C 8\u00adC6  (Hammond  ( 1967)  427,  478;  Dakaris  ( 1971)  16, 30\u00ad33). Varying  legendary  accounts  of  the  foundation  of  Elis existed  in  the  Classical  period,  giving  prominence  to  the  role of  Oxylos,  but  also  reflecting in one way or another Elis'  rela- tions  with  Aitolia  (cf.  Hdt. 8.73),  Elis'  relations  with  Sparta, and  Elis'  struggle  with  Pisa  for  control  of  Olympia.  The accounts  are  heavily  affected  by  political  considerations  of the  Classical  period.  See  Sordi  ( 1994). 252. ", "Eupagion": "Identifier: 256. , Map 58.  Unlocated.  Type:  B.

The  inscription  attests  the collective  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic. The  community  is  known  only  from  IvO 9  of  c. 500,a 100- year  alliance  with  Elis  (no. 251).  The  alliance  may  well  be  an example  of  the  hegemonial  alliance  by  which  Elis  structured its  relations  with  its  perioikoi  (Siewert  ( 1994a);  Ebert  and Siewert  ( 1999);  Roy ( 1997)  292\u00ad95);  if  so,  the  Ewaoioi  will have  been  a  perioikic  polis  somewhere  in  the  region  of  Elis. 254.Kyllene  (Kyllenios) Map  58.

The external  and  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic   occurs  in  Hom.  Il. 15.518),  but  is  not  found  in  Classical sources.  Called  a  polis  (and  limen)  only  by  Ps.-Skylax  43 (Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  148),  Kyllene  is  often called  epineion  as  a  base  for  the  Eleian  fleet (e.g.  Thuc. 1.30.2).  By  c. 400  it  was  fortified (Xen.  Hell. 3.2.30;  Roy ( 1997) 299\u00ad304;  cf.  Diod. 19.66.2  (r 314);  Polyb. 5.3.1  (r 218)).  Strabo 8.3.4  calls  it  a  kome  metria,  with  a  remarkable  ivory  statue  of Asklepios;  Paus. 6.26.4  mentions  sanctuaries  of  Asklepios and  Aphrodite  and  a  popular  cult  of  Hermes.  On  its  location and  archaeological  remains,  see  Servais  ( 1961),  who  makes  a convincing  case  for  identifying  it  with  the  physical  remains immediately  adjacent  to  modern  Killini  (despite  the  lack  of conclusive documentary  evidence).  There  was  a  town on that  site  at  least  from  C 5  to  the  Roman  imperial  period;  there is  no  direct  evidence  of  ancient  fortifications in place,  but Servais  ( 1961)  140)  found  numerous  large  blocks  of  stone which  he  identified as having once belonged t o  ancient  for- tifications.  Kyllene  had  cults  of  Asklepios  (Strabo  8.3.4; Paus. 6.26.4),  Aphrodite  (Paus. 6.26.4)  and  Hermes  (Paus. 6.26.4).  Only  the  reference  in  Ps.-Skylax  43  suggests  that Kyllene  had  the  status  of  a  polis. 255.  Laris(s)a Map 58.  Unlocated,  not  in  Barr.  Type:  A. Larisa  was  situated  in  the  borderland  between  Elis  (no. 251) and  Achaian  Dyme  (no. 234)  according  to  Theopomp.  fr. 386,  who  calls  it  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense.  The  location  may be  confirmed b y  a  reference  in  the  MSS  of  Xen.  Hell. 3.2.23 (  ) to a toponym  \"Larissa\"  on  a  route through  Achaia  into  Elis,  though  modern  editors  generally follow  Portus'  emendation  to   ,  referring  to the  river  between  Achaia  and  Elis  (Strabo  8.7.5).  Nothing else  is  known  about  this  Laris(s)a  (cf.  Hansen  ( 2000)  193), and,  according  to  the  references  in  Theopompos  and Xenophon,  it  could  have  been  in  either  Achaia  or  Elis. 256. ", "Lenos": "Identifier: 258. , Map 58.

It produced  one  or  two  early  Olympic  victors  (Phlegon (FGrHist) 257  fr. 4  (r 772)  and  possibly  fr. 6  (r 672),  where  the text  is  disturbed),  described  as  \"Eleian(s)  from  Dyspontion\". Paus. 6.22.4  reports  that  it  was  a  perioikic  community, though  presumably  not  Pisatan  since  it  joined  Pisa  in  revolt against  Elis  c. 570,  and  was  destroyed.  Strabo  8.3.32  says  that Dyspontion  was  destroyed  and  that  most  of  its  inhabitants emigrated  to  Epidamnos  (no. 79)  and  Apollonia  (no. 77). There  is  no  evidence  of  its  later  existence.  Because  of  the Olympic  victors,  it  may  have  been  a  polis.

Hell. 7.4.28). It  seems  clear  that  in  the  Archaic  period  Elis  struggled with  an  independent  community  Pisa;  the  ethnic   is  often  used  of  it  (e.g.  Paus. 6.22.4),  and  Stesichoros  (fr. 86, Page Strabo  8.3.31,  on  which  see  Hansen  ( 1998)  124\u00ad32) called  it  a  polis;  in  its  territory  lay  Olympia  (where  one  of  its own  citizens  was  victorious  in  724,  according  to Paus. 5.8.6  Olympionikai 15),  and  it  struggled  with  Elis  for  con- trol  of  Olympia  and  of  Pisatan  territory generally.  Elis  even- tually  prevailed--perhaps c. 570--and incorporated Pisatan territory  into  the  Eleian  state.  Because  reports  of  these events  are  distorted  by later  interests  (Sordi  ( 1994)),  little  is 500 roy known  about  the  Archaic  Pisatan  state  save  that  its  rulers were  remembered  as  kings  or  tyrants  (on  early  Pisatan  his- tory,  see RE  xx. 1746\u00ad53).  Pisa  later  broke  away from  Eleian control,  and  again  formed  an  independent,  or  at  least  self- governing,  state  365\u00adc.362,  but  was  then  reabsorbed  into  the Eleian  state.  It merits  inclusion  in  this  Inventory  primarily because  it  was  quite  possibly  a  polis  in 365\u00adc.362.  No  source explicitly  calls  it  a  polis,  but  the  internal  collective  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  found  in  IvO 36  DGE 422  ( 365\u00ad362)  and  the external  collective use  in  Xen.  Hell. 7.4.28;  it  issued  coins  and conducted  a  foreign  policy  (infra).  However,  several  points should  be  borne  in  mind  when  assessing  the  form  taken  by the  independent  Pisatan  state  of 365\u00adc.362.  First,  there  is  no reason  to  believe  in  the  existence  of  a  town  Pisa  (infra). Secondly,  there  were  other  towns  in  Classical  Pisatis: Alasyaion  (no. 245)  is  included  in  this  Inventory,  and Harpina,  Herakleia  and  Salmone  are  listed  above  among  the settlements  not  included,  but  a  strong  case  can  be  made  that yet  other  towns  also  existed  in  Classical  Pisatis  (Roy ( 2002a)).  According  to  the  criteria  used  in  the  present  work to  determine  whether  a  community  should  be  included, only  Alasyaion  merits  inclusion:  but  the  evidence  on  towns in  Pisatis  is  such  that  there  is  a  real  possibility  that  several Pisatan  towns  were  poleis  in  the  Classical  period  (Roy ( 2002a)).  If  there  were such  poleis,  then  presumably  during the  Classical  period,  except  for  the  period  365\u00adc.362,  they were  subordinate  poleis  within  the  territory  of  Elis  (cf.  the cases  of  Kyllene  (no. 254)  and  Pylos  (no. 263),  both  within Elis  but  not  in  Pisatis).  In  that  case  the  towns  could  have been  subordinate  poleis  of  Pisatis  in  365\u00adc.362.Alternatively, the  independent  state  of  Pisatis  may  have  been  not  a  polis, but  a  confederacy  of  several  small  poleis:  in  the  limited  sur- viving  evidence  there  is  no  indication  of  a  federal  structure, but  equally  nothing  to  exclude  it.  Thus  Pisatis  in  365\u00adc.362 may  have  been  ( 1)  a  polis  with  no  central  town  Pisa  but  with several  towns  not  of  polis  status  within  its  territory;  or  ( 2)  a polis  with  no  central  town  Pisa  but  with  several  subordinate poleis  within  its  territory;  or  ( 3)  not  a  polis  but  a  confederacy uniting  several  small  poleis.  Despite  this  last  possibility,  Pisa is  here  included  in  the  Inventory  of  poleis  because  its  status as  a  polis  is  likely;  but,  if  in  fact  a  polis,  it  may  have  had  a somewhat  anomalous  composition. The  extent  of  the  territory of  the  independent  Pisatan state  is  unknown,  but  presumably  included  some  or  all  of the  supposed  eight  poleis  of  Pisatis  (see  the  Introduction and  Alasyaion  (no. 245)  in  this  Inventory).  Despite  ancient attempts  to  argue  for  a  town  Pisa  (countered  by  Apollodoros in  Strabo  8.3.31),  there  is  no  reliable  evidence,  literary  or archaeological,  for  a  town  of  that  name,  and  no  reason  to believe  in  it  (KlPauly  iv. 866\u00ad67). Pisa's  claim  to  Olympia  was  still  remembered  c. 400  (Xen. Hell. 3.2.31,  where  the  other  claimants,  besides  the  Eleians, must  be  Pisatan).  When  war  broke  out  between  Arkadia  and Elis  (no. 251)  in  365,  the  Arkadians  occupied  various  pieces of  Eleian  territory (Xen.  Hell. 7.4.14),  including  Pisa,  which became  an  independent  state.  It  was  probably  a  puppet-state of  the  Arkadians:  the  Arkadians  were  able  to  draw  on Olympic  treasures  (Xen.  Hell. 7.4.33\u00ad34;Diod.15.82.1),as  the Pisatans  themselves  may  have  done  for  their  gold  coinage, and  it  was  often  said  that  the  Olympic  Games  of 364,regard- ed  as  a  non-Olympiad  by  the  Eleians  (Diod. 15.78.3),  were held  by  the  Pisatans  and  the  Arkadians  (Xen.  Hell. 7.4.28\u00ad29; Diod. 15.82.1;  Paus. 6.4.2)  or  even  by  the  Arkadians  alone (Paus. 6.8.3,  6.22.3;  cf.  Xen.  Hell. 7.4.35).  The  Pisatan  state none  the  less  appears  to  have  had  the  forms  of  an  independ- ent  state.  It  is  not  heard  of  again  after  the  battle  of  Mantinea in 362,  and  presumably  rapidly  returned  to  Elis,  which  had regained  control  of  Olympia  before  the  Olympic  Games  of 360. Pisa  made  treaties  with  Arkadia  and  Akroreia  and  with Messenia  and  Sikyon  (no. 228)  (Ringel  et al.( 1999)).  A Pisatan  decree  (IvO 36  DGE 422)  appointed  two  Sikyon- ians  proxenoi  and  theorodokoi:  the  decree  was  dated  by  three eponymous  Pisatan  hellanodikai  (not  noted  in  Sherk ( 1990b)). Pisa  minted  gold  coins  bearing  the  head  of  Zeus  and  with the  legend  (Head,  HN \u00b2426).  Pisa  held  the  Olympic Games  of 364  (Diod. 15.78.2\u00ad3),  though  (as  noted  supra) Arkadia  was  often  said  to have been  involved  in  organising the  games.  It  is  clear  that  for  a  brief  period  Pisa  discharged typical  functions  of  an  independent  Greek  state,  and  can  be regarded  as  such,  even  if  it  was  probably  in  fact  a  puppet- state  of  the  Arkadian  federation. Pisos  was  founder  of  Pisa  (RE  xx. 1806  no. 1).  The genealogical  claim  that  Olympia,  consort  of  Pisos,  was  a daughter  of  Arkas  (Etym.  Magn.  s.v.  Olympia)  may  be  an attempt,  from  the  period  of  Pisatan  independence,  to  con- nect  Pisa  and  Arkadia. 263.Pylos  (Pylios) Map  58.  Lat. 21.30,long.  37.55.

The  only  evidence  which  suggests  that  Pylos  may  have been  a  polis  is  the  use  of  a  collective  ethnic  twice  in  a  single passage  by Xenophon  (Hell. 7.4.26),  but  it  is  notable  that elis  501 Xenophon  appears  to include  in  the  \"Pylians\"  both  Eleian exiles  and  non-Eleian  foreigners,  though  possibly  through imprecision  in  the  narrative. There  was  ancient  confusion  about  the  location  because of  the  desire  to identify  Homeric  Pylos,  and  the  existence  of other  sites  called  Pylos  in  the  western  Peloponnese  (RE  xxiii. 2131\u00ad33  no. 3).  The  site  at  modern  Armatova  near Agrapidokhori,  which  has  been  thoroughly  excavated (Coleman  ( 1986)),  is  very probably  Pylos.  Xen.  Hell. 7.4.16 (r 365)  says  that  Eleian  exiles  seized  Pylos  and  were  joined  by many  of  the  Eleian  demos  because  it  was  a  chorion  kalon;  the Eleians  captured  the  Pylians  and  their  chorion  (ibid. 26).The excavation  has  shown  a  significant Classical n ucleated  set- tlement  from  c. 425,  but  without  monumental  architecture of  any  kind:  communal  buildings,  if  any,  must  have  been  of the  same  character  as  the  houses  (Coleman  ( 1986)  67).  The archaeological  findings are c ompatible  with  destruction  in the 360s.  Pylos  was  reputedly  founded  by  the  Megarian Pylon,  then  destroyed  by  Herakles,  and  refounded  by  the Eleians  (Paus. 6.22.5). 264.

Though  not  precisely  located, Amphidolia  lay  in  hilly  territory  west  of  Olympia;  Meyer (RE  xx. 1739)  suggests  that  it  did  not  extend  into  the  upper valley  of  the  river  Lestenitsa,  leaving  a  route  on  purely  Eleian territory  between  Elis  (no. 251)  and  Pisatis.

In  the  years  following  c. 400  it  is  seen  to  function  as  a polis:  it  is  described  as  a  (perioikic)  polis  in  the  political sense  at  Xen.  Hell. 3.2.23  and 30,  and  the  Amphidoloi  made a  dedication  at  Olympia  in  C 5  or  C 4e(Siewert(1991)no.  2), which  provides  an  instance  of  the  external  collective  use  of the  city-ethnic,  as  does  Xen.  Hell. 3.2.26  (cf. 4.2.16,where  it is  used  to  name  a  military  contingent).  It  is  not  known when  Amphidolia  became  subordinate  to  Elis,  but  presum- ably  no  later  than  adjacent  Pisatis.  Like  all  Eleian  perioikoi, it  was  freed  at  the  end  of  the  Eleian\u00adSpartan  war  c. 400 (Xen.  Hell. 3.2.25,  30;  Roy  ( 1997)  299\u00ad304).

The  existence of  an  ethnic  and  the  capacity  to  enter  into  a  treaty  with another  community  strongly  suggest  that  the  Anaitoi  were  a polis.  Failure  to  observe  the  treaty  is  to  be  sanctioned  by  the proxenoi  and  the  manteis  (in  Eleian  mantier),  and  ultimate- ly  by the  iaromaoi:  these  are  all  known  as  Eleian  officials at Olympia,  but  do  not  necessarily  imply  direct  subordination to  Elis  ( 251).

The  city-ethnic  is   known only  from  IvO 11  Minon  ( 1994)  no. 9,an  agreement of  C 5e  in  which  the  internal  and  collective  use  is  attested: hereditary  Chaladrian  citizenship  is  granted  to  a  man  called Deukalion,  together  with  status  equal  to  a  proxenos  and  to  a damiorgos  (Gauthier  ( 1972)  42\u00ad44)  and  possession  of  \"the land  in  Pisa\".  The  community  evidently  had  officials w ith the  titles  proxenos  and  damiorgos.The  damos  had  consider- able  authority:  the  final clause in the decree is t o  apply \"unless  the  damos  decides  otherwise\".  There  seems  no  doubt that  the  Chaladrioi  formed  a  polis.  The  text  is  in  Eleian dialect,  but  the  community  is  otherwise  entirely  unknown, and  could  belong  anywhere  in  the  region,  either  within  the Eleian  state  proper  or  in  perioikic  territory north  or  south  of the  river  Alpheios.  For  the  suggestion  that  the  land  which the  Chaladrioi  evidently  controlled  in  Pisa  was  land  for camping  during  Olympic  festivals,  available  for  use  at  other times,  see  Roy  ( 1997)  313  n. 31:  control  of  such  a  plot  need  not mean  that  the  territory  of  the  Chaladrioi  was  in  or  even  very close  to  Pisatis. 250.

Teithronion  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Hdt. 8.33 and,  retrospectively,  at  Paus. 10.3.1  and 2,  in  both  passages  in connection  with  Xerxes'  invasion  of  Phokis  in  480,when  the town  was  burned  to  the  ground.  Paus. 10.3.2\u00ad3  treats Teithronion  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  in  connection  with the  dioikismos  of  the  Phokian  cities  in  346  after  the  Third Sacred  War.  The  city  is  listed  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in the  Delphic  naopoioi  accounts,  where  the  Teithronioi  appear as  contributors  in  a  list  (CID ii  5.ii.50)  headed  by  the  formu- la:  \u00b5    ( ii.25\u00ad26).  The  collective use of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  one  of  the  receipts of  the  Phokian  fine ( CID ii  108.7  ( 322)),  and  internally  in  a proxeny  decree  of  C 3\u00adC2  (IG ix.1  222.10);  the  individual  use is  attested  externally  in  a  C 4\u00adC3  proxeny  decree  from  Delphi (no. 177)  (SEG 1198.5). The  dioikismos  of  Teithronion  in  346  (Paus. 10.3.2),as  well as  the  city's  contribution  in  322  to  the  payment  of  the  fine (CID ii  108.7),  ensure  that  Teithronion  was  a  member  of  the Phokian  koinon. Teithronion  is  situated  north  of  the  river  Kephisos  at  a bend  of  the  river  which  surrounds  the  southern  part  of  the city.

The  toponym  is  , (Strabo  9.3.14)  or (Paus. 10.3.2).The  only  attestation  of  a  city-ethnic  is at  Strabo  9.3.14:  '    .  Neither  the toponym  nor  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  prior  to  the Hellenistic  period;  but  Trachis  is  listed  by  Paus. 10.2.3  as  one of  the  poleis  exposed  to dioikismos  in 346,  which  shows  that, in  C 4m,  it  was  a  member  of  the  Phokian  koinon. The  location  of  Trachis  is  unknown.  The  only  indication is  provided  by  Strabo,  who  places  Trachis  near  Lebadeia  (no. 211)  ( 9.3.14:      ).  This piece  of  evidence  leaves  us  with  a  choice  between  three  dif- ferent  sites:  Kyriaki  (Fossey  ( 1986)  35\u00ad39;  Barr.),  Kastro- Tseresi  (Tillard  ( 1911)  66\u00ad68;  Fossey  ( 1986)  54\u00ad56;  Dassios ( 1992)  no. 62)  and  Korakolithos  (Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 57; 426 oulhen McInerney  ( 1999)  300\u00ad2).  Kastraki  should  probably  be identified w ith  Helikonioi  (supra 403).  At  Kastro-Tseresi there  is  a  small  enclosure  of  roughly  triangular  shape,  but only  the  north-western  side  of  c. 100  m  and  the  north-east- ern  side  of  c. 180  m  are  fortified.  The  longer  southern  side  is protected  by  steep  cliffs.  The  wall  is  in  rusticated  isodomic masonry  which  cannot  antedate  the  Classical  period,  and  no traces  of  the  Archaic  period  have  been  found.  Thus,  the identification w ith  *Aiolidai  as  proposed  by  Tillard  ( 1911) 66\u00ad68  is  dubious,  whereas  the  site  might  fit T rachis  (Rousset ( 1999)  43  n. 46,  but  more  cautiously  ( 2002)  45\u00ad46).  The topographic  information  found  in  Strabo,  however,  makes  a third  site  a  better  candidate:  viz.  Korakolithos.  A  small  emi- nence  is  all  that  is  still  visible  (Fossey  ( 1986)  59;  Dassios ( 1992)  no. 57),  but  the  existence  of  a  settlement  is  indicated by  a  C 5f\u00adC2f  cemetery  found  c. 1  km  to  the  west  (ArchDelt 33 ( 1978)  152).  Furthermore,  Lolling  mentions  the  remains-- no  longer  visible--of  a  defence  circuit  of 240  \"paces\" ( 200m?)  with  the  foundations  of  a  tower.  However,  the regulation  of  the  frontier  between  Phanoteus  (no. 190)  and Stiris  (no. 193)  (SEG 42  479)  is  not  easily  compatible  with  a C 3  polis  situated  at  Korakolithos;  cf.  the  map  in  Rousset  and Katzouros  ( 1992)  211. 196.Triteis  Map 55.  Unlocated.  Type:  A.  Triteis  is  known exclusively  from  one  passage  in  Herodotos:  at  8.35,  enumer- ating  the  Phokian  poleis  burnt  down by the  Persians  in  480, Herodotos  records  between  Pedieis  (no. 189)  and Elateia  (no. 180).  The  city  is  not  mentioned  in  any  other source  (Lerat  ( 1952)  i. 51  n. 7).  At  8.32.2  Herodotos  tells  us that  many  Phokians  found  refuge  at  Amphissa  (no. 158)  in Lokris,  and  Steph.  Byz. 637.16  reports  that  there  was  a situated  between  Phokis  and  West  Lokris.  On  the basis  of  these  two  pieces  of  evidence  Oldfather  ( 1939)  sug- gests  that  Lokrian  Tritea,  attested  from  C 5m  only,  may have been  founded  by  Triteians  coming  from  Phokis;  but  cf. Klaffenbach  ( 1937). The  location  of  Triteis  is  discussed  by  McInerney  ( 1999) 281\u00ad83.  The  text  of  Herodotos  suggests  a  location  west  of Elateia,  which  has  induced  some  scholars  to  identify  Triteis with  the  fortified enclosure at M odi  (Lolling  ( 1989)  90; Schober  ( 1924)  43).  But  the  chronology  of  this  small  fortifi- cation  fits L edon  (no. 184)  better  than  Triteis.  Alternatively, Triteis  has  been  located  between  Modi  and  Elateia  at  the  vil- lage  of  Turkochorion-Panagitsa  (Kirsten  ( 1951)  741  no. 106, followed  by Dakoronia,  ArchDelt  ( 1979)  194).  To  date,  how- ever,  the  only  remains  found  there  are  of  a  cemetery  used from  the  Geometric  to  the  Classical  period  (ArchDelt 34 ( 1979)  193\u00ad94,  36  ( 1981)  222,  43  ( 1988)  232\u00ad33,  44  ( 1989)  221). The  recent  discovery  of  a  fortification  2  km  south-east  of Modi  (Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 20;  cf.  supra  Pedieis)  invites  a reassessment  of  the  issue. 197.

The  toponym  is  ,  , attested  in  a  Delphic  manumission  act  to  designate  the  place of  origin  of  the  slave (SGDI 2132.3  ( 188/7)).  Steph.  Byz. 213.16 and  Hdn. iii.1276.35  both  mention  a  ,   .  This is  usually  interpreted  as  a  misread- ing  of (Robert  ( 1960)  74\u00ad75;  cf.  supra 403,s.v. Groneia).  The  masculine  form  of  the  city-ethnic  has  become an  issue.  In  an  inscription  of 322  recording  the  Phokians'  pay- ment  of  the  fine imposed in  346  (CID ii  108),  one  of  the  con- tributing  communities  is  recorded  as  [---]  ( 9),  usually  interpreted  as  the  city-ethnic  .But an equally  possible  restoration  is  [--- ],derived from  the  toponym  attested  in  Plut.  Sull. 15.6 (Robert  ( 1960)  75).  Patronis,  however,  seems  to  be  a  ghost toponym (supra 404),from  which  it  follows  that  the  Troneieis are  in  fact  attested  in  the  inscription. The  only  sources  to  classify  Troneia  as  a  polis  are  Steph. Byz.  and  Herodian  (accepting  the  conjecture  for ).  Furthermore,  Troneia  is  absent  from  Pausanias' list  of  poleis  exposed  to dioikismos  in 346  ( 10.3.1\u00ad2),  but  its contribution  to  the  fine in  322  ensures  that  it  was  a  member of  the  Phokian  koinon  and  undoubtedly  a  polis.  The  external use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  collectively  in  the  payment of 322  (CID ii  108.9).  The  individual  and  external  use  of  the city-ethnic  can  be  deduced  from  a  manumission  of  C 2s  in which  the  origin  of  a  slave  is  recorded  as     (SGDI 2130.3). Paus. 10.4.10  mentions  a  part  of  the  territory of  Daulis (no. 176)  called  in  which  was  situated  the  shrine  of  a founder  hero,  either  Xanthippos  or  Phokos,  who  reappears in  a  second  century  ad  inscription  from  Daulis  (IG ix.1 61.50).  This  Tronis  is  undoubtedly  the  name  of  the  territory of  the  city  of  Troneia,  and  the  presumption  is  that,  in  the time  of  Pausanias,  Troneia  had  been  incorporated  into Daulis  (Robert  ( 1960)  78\u00ad80). Interpreting  the  three  sources  (Paus. 10.4.10;Plut.  Sull. 15.6;  IG ix.161),  all  commentators  agree  that  Troneia  should be  located  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Daulis,  and  two  identi- fications have been suggested:  (a)  Kato  Tseresi,  south  of Daulis,  and  (b)  Ag.  Marina  west  of  Daulis. Re  (a):  the  historians  who  distinguished  Troneia  from Patronis  suggested  the  site  of  Kato Tseresi  lying  south  of phokis  427 Daulis  (Kirsten  ( 1939)).  Considering  that  this  site  can  be identified w ith  a  small  fort  only,  Robert  ( 1960)  78\u00ad82  cau- tiously  suggested  a  location  somewhat  south  of  Daulis  (con- tra  McInerney  ( 1997)  197\u00ad99). Re  (b):  a  preferable  site  for  Troneia  has  been  proposed  by historians  who  identify  Patronis  with  Troneia  (Tillard  ( 1911) 64\u00ad66;  Kirsten  ( 1951)  713;  cautiously  Fossey  ( 1986)  53;  Barr.) and  thus  follow  the  topographical  indication  given  by  Plut. Sull. 15.6.  This  site  is  identified w ith  Patronis  by  historians who,  wrongly  in  my  opinion,  distinguish  between  Troneia and  Patronis  (Schober  ( 1924)  38;  Kirsten  ( 1949b);  Robert ( 1960).  The  site  in  question  is  at  Ag.  Marina,  where  there  are remains  on  a  rocky  hill  of  which  only  the  northern  and  east- ern  part  had  to  be  fortified.  The  wall  is  in  two  different  types of  masonry:  the  curtain  is  in  joggled  trapezoidal  masonry, and  the  towers  in  isodomic  masonry.  The  wall  and  the  west- ern  escarpment  enclose  an  area  of  c. 100  m  north\u00adsouth  by 150  m  west\u00adeast  and  rise  above  the  remains  of  a  grid- planned  lower  town. 428 oulhen", "Boulis": "Identifier: 175. , (Boulios) Map  55.  Lat. 38.15,long.  22.50.  Size of  territory: 2.  Type:  C.  The  toponym  is  ,  ,  exclu- sively  attested  in  late  literary  sources  (Paus. 10.37.2\u00ad3;Steph. Byz. 182.5)  or  ,  ,  (Ptol.  Geog. 3.14.18).  The  city-ethnic  is  (Paus. 10.37.1\u00ad2,  most MSS)  or  (some  MSS  and  Steph.  Byz. 182.6). According  to  Pausanias,  the  toponym  was  derived  from  the name ,the oecist of  this  colony  founded  by some  of the  poleis  of  Doris: \u00b5          ,                 ( 10.37.2). The  only  sources  in  which  Boulis  is  classified as a polis  are Steph.  Byz.  and  Ptol.  Geog.,  which  lists  Boulis  among  the  \u00b5,  using  polis  in  a  purely  topographical sense,  as  in  the  case  of  the  Attic  demes  which  are  also  called  \u00b5  ( 3.15.22).  Even  if  Pausanias'  link  between Boulis  and  Boulon  is  suspicious,  there  is  no  reason  to  reject his  testimony  about  the  foundation  of  Boulis.  And  the  status of  apoikia  implies  the  status  of  polis.  The  date  of  the  founda- tion,  however,  is  unknown.  With  Herakleia  as  a  possible analogy  (Thuc. 3.92),  it  is  tempting  to  connect  the  founda- tion  with  the  strained  relations  between  Doris  and  its  neigh- bours  in  C 5  (Thuc. 1.107).  But  that  remains  a  hypothesis. It  is  problematic,  on  the  other  hand,  that  Boulis  is  not  list- ed  by  Pausanias  as  one  of  the  poleis  subjected  to dioikismos  in 346  ( 10.3.1\u00ad2).  But  this  list  is  not  exhaustive  (see  supra 400), and  an  argument  from  silence  carries  no  weight.  On  the contrary,  in  a  mutilated  passage  Pausanias  connects  the Boulioi  with  Philomelos,  the  Phokians  and  their  assembly:     \u00b5    ...     (Paus. 10.37.2).  No  matter  how  the passage  is  emended,  there  must  be  some  connection between  the  Boulioi  and  the  Phokian  assembly  in  the  period 356\u00ad354.  The  inference  seems  to  be  that  Boulis  was  a  polis  in the  years  356\u00ad354.  It  is  unknown  whether  the  relations between  the  Boulioi  and  the  Phokians  were  friendly  or  hos- tile.  That  depends  on  how  the  passage  is  emended.  The  text 410 oulhen has  been  interpreted  in  different  ways  (see  the  apparatus  in the  editions  by Hitzig-Bluemner  ( 1896\u00ad1910)  and  Rocha Pereira  ( 1973\u00ad81)).  The  attempt  to restore  a  form  of  the  city- ethnic  in  IG ix.1  111.5  CID ii  38  is  too  far-fetched  to  be  fur- ther  discussed  here;  cf.  infra  no. 192. The  remains  of  Boulis'  city  walls  are  undated.  The  circuit is  partly  constructed  in  local  limestone  in  trapezoidal masonry  and  a  part  of  reddish  poros  stone  in  ashlar  mason- ry  (Leake  ( 1835)  ii. 520\u00ad23;  Dassios  ( 1992)  65  no. 70;  ArchDelt 36  ( 1981)  193\u00ad94  pl. 122d).  The  discovery  of  sherds  of  the Classical  period  ensures  that  the  site  was  inhabited  at  that time  (ArchDelt 36  ( 1981)  193).  Pausanias  mentions  three sanctuaries:  one  of  Megistos  (undoubtedly  Zeus),  one  of Artemis  and  one  of  Dionysos.  The  cult  statues  of  the  two  last gods  were of  wood,  but  that  does  not  warrant  any  conclu- sion  about  their  date  (Donohue  ( 1988)  173\u00ad74). 175.

Il. 2.521;  Hdt. 8.28;  Paus. 10.1.3;  IG ix.186.1  (c. ad  100)).  However,  a  scholiast  on  Homer  (schol. Hom.  Il. 521)  and  Eust.  Il. 275.5,  both  citing  the  same  source, claim  that  the  locals  ( ) call it `\u00b5.In inscriptions,  the  city-ethnic  is  invariably  `\u00b5  (SEG 37  422  (C 5s)),  whereas  literary  sources  have  `\u00b5 (Xen.  Hell. 6.4.27).  The  interpretation  of  the  toponym  as  a composite  word  whose  second  part  is  --whether cor- rect  or  not--has led t o  the  construction  of  variant  forms  of both  toponym  and  city-ethnic.  From  the  accusative  written in  two  words,    (Hell.  Oxy. 21.5)  or  (Diod. 16.56.1),  some  authors  invented  the  nominative   (Strabo  9.2.3,  3.15),  and  this  form  was  then  connected  with the  Hyantes  of  Thebes  (Paus. 10.35.5;Strabo 9.2.3),  whereas the  schol.  Eur.  Or. 1094  claim  that  Hyampolis  is  a  foundation of  Hyamos,  the  son  of  Lykoros.  By  analogy  with  polis-- polites,  the  authors  construct  the  city-ethnic  `\u00b5, which  is  the  only  form  found  in  literary  sources  (Xen.  Hell. 6.4.27;  Paus. 10.1.8;  Steph.  Byz. 644.10). Hyampolis  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Hdt. 8.33 in  connection  with  Xerxes'  invasion  of  Phokis  in  480,  when Hyampolis  was  burnt  to  the  ground;  by  Hell.  Oxy. 21.5  in connection  with  the  Boiotian  campaign  into  Phokis  in  395; and  retrospectively  by Paus. 10.3.1,where  Hyampolis  is  listed as  one  of  the  poleis  exposed  to dioikismos  in 346.  The  collec- tive  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  SEG 37 422.5  (C 5s),  where  the  ` appear  as  guarantors  of  a loan.  For  the  individual  and  external  use,  see  IG vii  3055.39 (C 4m),  where  an  [ `\u00b5]  is  attested  as  consulting  the oracle  of  Trophonios  at  Lebadeia  (no. 211). The  city  was  situated  in  the  middle  of  a  pass  which  was one  of  the  main  approaches  to  Phokis  from  the  north  (Paus. 10.1.11;  Ellinger  ( 1993)  22\u00ad27).  In  C 1  the  city  bordered  on Opous  (no. 386;Strabo 9.2.23)  and,  being  a  border  town, Hyampolis  became  the  centre  of  legendary  stories  about  the conflicts between Phokis and Thessalia in the A rchaic  peri- od  (C 6?;  cf.  Ellinger  ( 1993)  17\u00ad22).  The  sanctuary  of  Artemis Elaphebolia  was  situated  in  the  territory  of  Hyampolis  (SEG 37  422\u00ad23),  and  from  C 6(?)  the  Phokians  celebrated  the annual  Elaphebolia  in  this  sanctuary,  commemorating  their victory  over  the  Thessalians  (Plut.  Mor. 244B\u00adD,  660D, 1099E\u00adF;  cf.  Ellinger  ( 1993)  22\u00ad37).The  recent  excavations  of the  sanctuary  of  Artemis  Elaphebolia  and  Apollo  have revealed  continuous  habitation  and  utilisation  from  the Mycenaean  age  (LH iiiC)  to  the  Byzantine  period  (Felsch and  Kienast  ( 1975);  Felsch  et al.( 1980),  ( 1987);  Felsch  and Siewert  ( 1987);  Kalapodi i:  xvi\u00adxvii).

Mor. 244D  (rC 6)  men- tions  the  toponym  ,and some commentat ors  have erroneously  assumed  the  existence  of  a  community  depend- ent  on  Hyampolis  (supra 407). If  one  can  trust  Pausanias'  piece  of  information  that,  in the  C 6  war  against  Thessalia,  the  Phokian  cavalry  was  com- manded  by  a   `\u00b5,  it  follows  that Hyampolis  was  a  member  of  the  Phokian  koinon,  and  that  is further  confirmed b y  the  Phokian  federal  coinage:  the female  head  on  the  reverse  of  some  of  the  triobols  struck  in 418 oulhen C 6l  by  the  Phokians  is  usually  taken  to  be  the  head  of Artemis  Elaphebolia  (Williams  ( 1972)  2),  and  a  rare issue  of C 5m  has  on  the  obverse  a  kneeling  Artemis  armed  with  bow and  quiver  (Williams  ( 1972)  43;  Felsch  and  Siewert  ( 1987) 687). In C 4e  Hyampolis  was  fortified w ith  a  defence  circuit, and  in  395  the  Boiotians  made  an  abortive  attack  on  the  walls  of  the  city  (Hell.  Oxy. 21.5).  In  371  Jason  of  Pherai invaded  Phokis,  conquered  the  suburb  (  ) of Hyampolis  and  ravaged  the  (Xen.  Hell. 6.4.27). Remains  of  the  fortifications are still v isible  on  the  plateau where  Hyampolis  once  lay.  A  circuit  wall  encloses  an  area  of some 280  m  (north\u00adsouth)  by  200  m  (east\u00adwest).  The  wall  is in  trapezoidal  masonry,  with  a  dozen  interval  towers  and  is usually  dated  to  C 4s  (Fossey  ( 1986)  72\u00ad73).  Paus. 10.35.6 mentions  a  small  bouleuterion,  a  theatre  near  the  gate  and  an ancient  agora,  and  he  believes  that  these  buildings  antedat- ed  the  dioikismos  of 346. 183.Kirrha  (Kirrhaios) Map  55.  Lat. 38.25,long.  22.30. Size  of  territory:  ?  Type  A.  The  toponym  is  ,  (CID  II 31.45,  46,  56  (C 4m);  Kallisthenes  (FGrHist 124)  fr. 1).  is  a  hapax  attested  in  Marm.  Par.(FGrHist 239)  A 37.The relation  between  (supra),(Hom.Il.2.520) and (Alc.  fr. 7)  has  been  debated  since  Antiquity  (Etym. Magn. 515.18;  Eust.  Il. 1.420.15,  van  der  Valk;  cf.  Robertson ( 1978);  Parker  ( 1997)).  From  a  linguistic  point  of  view  the attested  forms  can  easily  be  explained  as  phonetic  variants of  the  same  toponym;  but  an  identification depends on (a) an  identification of  the  corresponding  ethnics   and ,  mentioned  in  accounts  of  the  First  Sacred War;  (b)  the  location  of  Homeric  Krisa  and  Classical  Kirrha. These  questions  have  been  debated  since  Antiquity  (Strabo 9.3.3\u00ad4;  Paus. 10.37.5;  Steph.  Byz. 385.7;  for  modern  contro- versies  over  the  First  Sacred  War,  see  infra 420).  The  city-ethnic  is  (Aeschin. 3.107\u00ad8;Dem.  18.152; Kallisthenes  (FGrHist 124)  fr. 1).  Kirrha  is  called  a  polis  in  the urban  sense  at  Aeschin. 3.108\u00ad9.  All  attestations  of  the  city- ethnic  testify  to the  collective and  external  use. Since  C 4  at  least,  Kirrha  was  the  name  of  the  port  of Delphi  (CID ii  31  (C 4f);  Polyb. 5.27.3;  F.Delphes iii.1  318  (C 1); Paus. 10.37.4:     ).  Kirrha  is  classified as a in  Paus. 10.37.5,  and  at  10.37.6  he  quotes  an  oracle  in which  it  is  described  as  a  citadel  ( ... ;  cf. Diod. 9.16;  Aeschin. 3.112;  Fontenrose  ( 1978)  Q 71). With  this  harbour  town  was  associated  a  territory  called    (Dem. 18.149)  or     (Ps.- Skylax 37;  cf.  Rousset  ( 2002)  183\u00ad87).  In  the  Classical  period this  plain  corresponded  to  the  lower  Pleistos  valley,  which stretches  from  Delphi  and  Amphissa  to  the  port  of  Kirrha. Such  a  location  explains  the  exploitation  by  the Amphissaians  (Aeschin. 3.119)  as  well  as  the  occasional  refer- ence  to  the  plain  as  being  Lokrian  (schol.  Hom.  Il. 2.520).  In other  sources  the  plain  is  called     (Hdt. 8.32.2;Isoc.  14.31).  The  Pythian  hippodrome  and  stadium were  probably  placed  here  in  the  Classical  period (Bommelaer  ( 1991)  215),  and  accordingly  each  of  these  two sports  grounds  were  called  by  Pindar  (Pyth. 3.74; 8.19)  and  Bacchylides  ( 11.13).The  variant  (Pind.Pyth. 6.18;Soph.  El. 730)  has  a  Homeric  touch  (Lerat  ( 1948)). The  port  of  Kirrha  is  ideally  situated  at  modern Xeropighado  (Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 128).There  are  some  prehis- toric  remains  (Hope  Simpson  ( 1981)  78;  Skorda  ( 1992)  42\u00ad43, 60\u00ad61),  then  a  complete  break,  and  then  again  partly  excavat- ed  remains  of  C 6s  and  later:  (a)  a  defence  circuit,  part  of which  is  described  by  the  excavator  as  Classical  (ArchDelt 49 ( 1994)  Chron. 317\u00ad18).  The  circuit  was  still  visible  in  the  mid- nineteenth  century  (Ulrichs  ( 1863)  207\u00ad8);  (b)  remains  of Classical  habitation  (ArchDelt 34  ( 1979)  Chron. 207,  49  ( 1994) Chron. 317)  and  habitation  of  the  Roman  period;  (c)  remains of  the  harbour  and  warehouses(?)  (Rolley  et al.( 1990)  28\u00ad29); (d)  a  sanctuary  probably  dedicated  to  Apollo,  Artemis  and Leto  with  offerings  dating  back  to  C 6m  (Luce  ( 1991)).  It  is probably(?)  in  Kirrha  that  one  should  place  the  common mentioned  in  the  Amphiktyonic  law  of 380  (CID i 10.22).  The  site  was  apparently  not  destroyed  by  the  interven- tion  of  the  hieromnemones  instigated  by  Aischines  in  340 (Aeschin. 3.123;  Luce  ( 1991)). The  port  of  Kirrha  was  situated  on  the  territory  conse- crated  to  Apollo  (Aeschin. 3.107)  and  administered  by  the Amphiktyony,  which  interfered  with  the  collection  of  har- bour  dues  (Aeschin. 3.119;  BCH 118  ( 1994)  99\u00ad112  (C 5))  and in  the  accommodation  arrangements  (CID i10.2.2  ( 380)). Consequently,  the  port  did  not  belong  to  the  city  of  Delphi. The  extra-territorial  status  of  Kirrha  fits the only secure attestation  of  the  ethnic  not  related  to  the  First Sacred  War.  At  Dem. 18.152  the  collective form   appears  as  a  kind  of  pseudo-ethnic  denoting  the  persons who  in  C 4m  had  fraudulently  settled  the  land  consecrated  to Apollo,  the     ( 18.149).  The  suggestion  that  the Kirrhaioi  struck  coins  is  based  on  an  erroneous  reading (Williams  ( 1972)  72),  and  the  only  epigraphical  attestation of  the  ethnic  is  questionable  (SGDI 2505  (C 4\u00adC3);  cf. Rousset  ( 2002)  33,  213). The    was  part  of  a  larger  area  called     (CID i10.21;  Aeschin. 3.118).  This  sacred  area  phokis  419 comprised,  to  the  south,  a  large  part  of  the  Desphina  penin- sula  (Rousset  ( 1996),  ( 2002)  58\u00ad59),  and  to  the  east  it  bor- dered  on  the  Phokian  poleis  of  Antikyra  (no. 173)  and Ambryssos  (no. 171)  (F.Delphes iii.4280B\u00adD  (C 2s);  Rousset ( 2002)  168\u00ad69).  Agriculture  and,  in  general,  any  kind  of exploitation  of  the  territory  consecrated  to  Apollo  was  pro- hibited  (CID i10.15\u00ad17;  Aeschin. 3.108\u00ad9);  only  the  herds  of Apollo  were  allowed  to graze  the  plain  (Rousset  ( 2002) 192\u00ad205).  The  prohibition  was  repeatedly  ignored  by  the Phokians  during  the  Second  and  Third  Sacred  Wars  (Paus. 10.15.1  (C 5m);cf.Parke  ( 1939)  65\u00ad71;Diod.16.23.3  (C 4m)).In 340,  in  the  prelude  to  the  Fourth  Sacred  War,  the Amphissaians  were  accused  by  Aischines  of  having  built farms  and  brickworks  in  the  plain,  of  having  refortified and resettled  the  harbour  town,  and  of  having  levied  taxes  from the  visitors  (Aeschin. 3.113,  119). The  only  Classical  classification of  Kirrha  as  a  polis  occurs in  this  context.  In  a  speech  delivered  in  340,  Aischines reminds  the  Amphiktyonic  Council  of  the  oracle  which  trig- gered  the  First  Sacred  War  in  C 6e:  to  fight the K irrhaioi  and Kragalidai  (described  as  ),  to  ravage  their  territory ( ) and their town ( used  in  the  urban  sense),  to expose  the  population  to  andrapodismos,  to  consecrate  the land  to  Apollo,  Artemis,  Leto  and  Athena  Pronoia,  and  to leave  it  untilled  (Aeschin. 3.108;  Fontenrose  ( 1978)  Q 70). According  to  Aischines,  the  Council  voted  for  war,  and  the Kirrhaioi  and  Kragalidai  were  exposed  to  the  penalties described  in  the  oracle,  including  the  destruction  of  the  polis (Aeschin. 3.109\u00ad11).  It  is  unclear  what  genos  denotes,  and whether  the  polis  is  that  of  the  Kirrhaioi  or  the  Kragalidai,  or a  city  common  to  both  groups;  see  supra 402. In  addition  to  Aischines'  account  of  the  historical  background  to  the  Fourth  Sacred  War,  we  have  a  number  of later  historiographic  accounts  of  the  First  Sacred  War (Kallisthenes  (FGrHist 124)  fr. 1;  Hippoc.  Ep. 27,pp.  406\u00ad8, Littr\u00e9;  Diod. 9.16;Strabo 9.3.3\u00ad4;Plut.  Sol. 11;Polyaen.  3.5, 6.13;  Paus. 10.37.4\u00ad8;  Pind.  Hyp.  Pyth.  a  and  b).  But  these accounts  are  notoriously  muddled  and  contradict  one another  (Robertson  ( 1978);  Lehmann  ( 1980);  C\u00e0ssola ( 1980);  Davies  ( 1994)). No  Archaic  remains  antedating  C 6m  have  been  found  at Xeropighado  (supra 419).  No  site  fits the historiographic account  of  the  events  (siege  and  destruction  of  a  fortified settlement),  or  the  location  (between  Delphi  and  the Corinthian  Gulf),  or  the  chronology  (C 6e)  (cf.  Rousset ( 2002)  43\u00ad44).Another  point  to  be  taken  into  account  is  the marginal  location  of  the  port  of  Kirrha  in  relation  to  the peninsula  of  Desphina,  which  constituted  the  central  part  of the  sacred  land.  This  topography  does  not  fit the historical traditions  (cf.,  however,  Pind.  Hyp.  Pyth.  b). The  state  of  the  evidence  speaks  against  accepting  Kirrha as  a  polis  destroyed  in  C 6e.On  the  contrary,  the  sources  seem to  substantiate  the  opposite  view:  that,  in  the  Archaic  period down to  C 6e,  there  was  no  polis  of  the  Kirrhaioi  whose territory  had  been  consecrated  to  Apollo.  The  polis  status  of Krisa/Kirrha  in  C 6e  is  an  aetiological  invention  which became  prominent  in  the  context  of  the  Third  and  Fourth Sacred  Wars  in  order  to  explain  the  obscure  origin  of  the hiera ge.  In  that  case,  there  is  no  reason  to  debate  the  his- toricity  of  such  a  polis  any  longer  (see  Krisa,  supra 419). 184.Ledon  (Ledontios) Map  55.

Byz. 1.1)  or  (Hsch. 65).  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG ix.178.2  (C 3l);  Paus. 10.3.2).Abai  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Hdt. 8.33  in connection  with  Xerxes'  invasion  of  Phokis  in  480,  when Abai  was  burnt  to  the  ground  and,  retrospectively,  at  Paus. 10.3.2  (r 346).  The  collective  and  external  use  of  the  city- ethnic  is  attested  in  a  letter  of  Philip  V  to  the  Abaians  (IG ix.1 78.2)  and,  retrospectively,  in  Paus. 10.3.2  (rC 4m);  cf.  also 10.35.4.  The  individual  and  external  use  is  attested  in  a  C 2s Delphic  manumission  (F.Delphes iii.2230.7)  and  in  a  first century  ad  proxeny  decree  (F.Delphes iii.4443). Abai  is  commonly  mentioned  in  literary  sources  in  con- nection  with  the  oracle  of  Apollo  situated  in  its  territory (Hdt. 8.27.5  (rC 6?);  for  the  date,  see  Ellinger  ( 1993)  17\u00ad22; Hdt. 1.46.2  (rC 6m),  8.33,  8.134;Soph.  OT 899;  Paus. 4.32.5 (r 371);  Diod. 16.58  (r 347/6);  Paus. 10.35.1\u00ad5).  The  location  of the  sanctuary  is  unknown  (Ellinger  ( 1993)  25,  contra  Yorke ( 1896)  298\u00ad302;  McInerney ( 1999)  288\u00ad89).  Abaios  as  the epithet  of  Apollo  is  attested  in  Hsch. 50  and  confirmed b y onomastic  material  (Sittig  ( 1911)  52).  The  identity  between the  epithet  and  the  city-ethnic  may  be  the  explanation  of  the use  of  the  toponym  to  designate  the  sanctuary  itself  (Strabo 9.3.13). There  can  be  no  doubt  that  Abai  was  a  member  of  the Phokian  koinon,  although  there  is  no  explicit  attestation.  In the  idiom         (Hdt. 1.46.2  (rC 6m)  and 8.134.1  (rC 5f))  the  reference  to  the  Phokians  indicates  loca- tion  rather  than  political  status,  and  that  applies  also  to Kallisthenes  (FGrHist 124)  fr. 11.  On  the  other  hand, Pausanias'  account  of  the  fate  of  Abai  in  346  implies  that Abai  belonged  to  the  Phokian  koinon.  Pausanias  asserts  that Abai  avoided  the  dioikismos  because  it  participated  neither in  the  occupation  of  the  sanctuary  in  Delphi  nor  in  the  war ( 10.3.2).  Diodorus,  on  the  other  hand,  tells  us  that  in  347  the Phokians  built  a  phrourion  on  what  was  undoubtedly Abaian  territory  ( 16.58.4;  cf.  Dassios  ( 1995),  ( 1992)  no. 43). The  possible  inferences  from  these  two  pieces  of  informa- tion  are  (a)  that  in  347  the  Abaians  no  longer  had  control  of their  own  territory,  or  (b)  that  Abai's  participation  in  the war  was  purely  defensive,  or  (c)  that  Abai's  pacifist attitude is  a  later  rewriting  of  history. The  site  is  enclosed  by  a  fortification wall in polygonal masonry,  a  part  of  it  in  Lesbian  style.  Both  the  acropolis  and the  lower  town  were  fortified,  and  the  walls  enclosed  an  area of  c. 16  ha.  The  wall  enclosing  the  acropolis  may  be  older  than that  enclosing  the  lower  town,  but  the  dates,  based  on  style and  a  priori  historical  arguments,  are  disputed  (Yorke  ( 1896) 294\u00ad96:C5  or  earlier;  Scranton  ( 1941)  160:C6;  Fossey  ( 1986) 78\u00ad79,  122\u00ad27:C5;  Winter  ( 1971)  103:  the  wall  enclosing  the lower  town  not  earlier  than  C 4).  Pausanias  mentions  an agora  and  a  theatre  both  of  ancient  construction  ( 10.35.4:    ).  The  remains  found  in  the  neigh- 408 oulhen bouring  sanctuary  and  in  the  cemetery  date  back  to  C 7 (Fossey  ( 1986)  164\u00ad65). 170.  *Aiolidai  (Aiolideus) Map  55.

Size  of  territory:  ?  Type:  A.  The toponym  is  unattested  and  reconstructed  from  the  city- ethnic.  The  city-ethnic  is  ,  attested  at  Hdt. 8.35.1 in  its  collective and  external  use.  The  of  the   is  known exclusively  from  Herodotos'  account  at  8.35.1 of  Xerxes'  march in  480  from  Phanoteus  towards  Delphi when  *Aiolidai  was  burnt  to  the  ground:            ( MS  P).  Tillard  ( 1911)  64  demonstrat- ed  that  Valckenaer's  conjecture  must  be  rejected for  topographical  reasons.  At  Mor. 418A  Plutarch mentions a  group  of  persons  in  Delphi  perhaps  called  the  , but  there  is  no  reason  to  connect  them  with  the   attested  in  Herodotos  (Rousset  ( 2002)  28). At  Hdt. 8.35.1  polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense,  but  the  use of  the  city-ethnic  instead  of  the  toponym  indicates  that  the political  sense  is  a  connotation;  see  Hansen  ( 2000)  176,  205. The  passage  from  Herodotos  shows  that  the  polis  of  the Aiolideis  must  have  been  situated  between  Daulis  and Delphi.  Assuming  that  the  polis  was  fortified,  one  would have to exclude  the  site  of  Phokikon,  where,  however,  some epitaphs  of  the  Archaic  period  have  been  found  (Fossey ( 1986)  57).  On  the  other  hand,  *Aiolidai  must  then  be  iden- tified w ith  one  of  the  three  sites  found  along  this  route:  (a) Rosoufi  (  Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 68),  the  remains  of  which, however,  are  poorly  attested;  or  (b)  Kastro-Zemenou (McInerney  ( 1999)  304  Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 112),  but  the remains  do  not  look  like  a  permanent  settlement  and  the alleged  Archaic  remains  are  questionable;  (c)  Kastro  Teresi, where  no  remains  of  the  Archaic  period  have  been  found  (Tillard  ( 1911)  66\u00ad68  *Aiolidai;  Fossey  ( 1986) 54\u00ad56  Phlygonion;  Rousset  ( 2002)  43  n. 46  Trachis).  In any  case,  one  must  abandon  the  identification of  *Aiolidai with  the  remains  at  Bania  (Schober  ( 1924)  22).  This  site  is  to be  identified w ith  ancient  Phlygonion  (no. 191),  and  there  is no  basis  for  assuming  a  change  of  name  from  *Aiolidai  to Phlygonion.  To conclude,  the  location  of  *Aiolidai  remains unresolved. 171. ", "Phanoteus": "Identifier: 191. , is  the easternmost  polis  of  Phokis,  bordering  on  Boiotian Chaironeia  (no. 201)  (Thuc. 4.76.3;Plut.  Lys. 29.4  (rC 4e); Paus. 9.40.12).  A  C 3  inscription  lays  down  the  frontier between  Phanoteus  and  Stiris  (no. 193),  situated  south  of Mt.  Helikon  (SEG 42  479),  and  according  to  Strabo 9.3.14, Phanoteus  bordered  on  \"the  region  round  Lebadeia\"  (no. 211).  In 395  the  body  of  Lysandros  was  carried  over  the frontier  of  Boiotia  and  buried  in  the  territory  of  Phanoteus (Plut.  Lys. 29.4),  testimony  of  Lakedaimonian  alliance  with Phokis  in  general  rather  than  with  Phanoteus  in  part- icular. 424 oulhen The  Boiotian  attack  on  Phanoteus  in  395,  as  well  as  the dioikismos  in 346,  ensure  that  the  polis  belonged  to  the Phokian  koinon  in  C 4.  Membership  in  C 5,too,is to be assumed,  but  there  is  no  explicit  evidence  (Thuc. 4.76.3, 89.1). The  eponymous  hero  of  Phanoteus  was  Phanoteus,  son  of Phokos  (Steph.  Byz. 500.19;  Paus. 2.29.2),  and  this  founda- tion  myth  can  be  traced  back  to  Archaic  and  Classical sources  (Hom.  Il. 23.665;Soph.  El. 45;  Pl.  Ion 533B,  Resp. 620C). Phanoteus  is  situated  on  a  steep-sided  hill  measuring c. 600  m  by  100  m,  described  as  an  by Polyb. 5.96.5. From Hell.  Oxy. 21.5  it  can  be  inferred  that  the  site  was  forti- fied in  395.On  the  eminence  are  two  types  of  remains:  (a)  on the  southern  slope  is  a  stretch  of  a  wall  in  \"cyclopean\" masonry,  often  interpreted  as  traces  of  a  Mycenaean  acrop- olis  (Lazenby  and  Hope  Simpson  ( 1970)  42\u00ad43;  Fossey ( 1986)  63\u00ad64;  cf.  Hom.  Il. 17.307\u00ad8;  Paus. 10.4.2);  (b)  apart from  stretches  where  the  escarpment  offers  sufficient  protection,  the  entire  hill  is  enclosed  by  a  defence  circuit, with  eight  interval  towers  on  the  western  and  southern sides.  The  length  of  the  peribolos  was  seven  stades  according to  Paus. 10.4.2.  The  wall  was  built  partly  in  irregular  trape- zoidal  masonry,  unique  in  Phokis,  and  partly  in  isodomic masonry  (Kirsten  ( 1949a)  641\u00ad47;  Fossey  ( 1986)  63\u00ad64).  A part  of  the  wall  may  correspond  to  an  internal  diateichisma. This  fortification,  of  which  the  western  and  southern  parts are  well  preserved,  cannot  be  dated  with  certainty:  Camp ( 2000)  45  suggests  the  late  340s;  but  according  to Winter ( 1971)  it  is  \"post  Chaironeian\",  see  supra 401.  The  early  trav- ellers  describe  a  section  of  a  wall  which  is  no  longer  visible, perhaps  the  defence  circuit  of  the  lower  town  (Leake  ( 1835) ii. 110\u00ad11;  Frazer  ( 1898)  218;  Camp  et al.( 1997)  267  n. 29).  The occupation  of  the  suburbs  (proastion)  by  the  Boiotians, mentioned  at  Hell.  Oxy. 21.5,  indicates  that  the  lower  town was  unfortified in  395.  The  famous  passage  in  Paus. 10.4.1 about  the  absence  of  public  buildings  of  Phanoteus  in  his own  time  carries  no  weight  as  evidence  for  the  Archaic  and Classical  periods  (Alcock  ( 1995)  326\u00ad27). 191.

Erochos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Hdt. 8.33  and, retrospectively,  at  Paus. 10.3.2,  in  both  passages  in  connec- tion  with  Xerxes'  invasion  of  Phokis  in  480,  when  Erochos was  burnt  to  the  ground.  Paus. 10.3.2  treats  Erochos  as  a  polis once  again  in  connection  with  the  dioikismos  of  the  Phokian cities  in  346  after  the  Third  Sacred  War.  The  external  and individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  for  two  magis- trates  of  the  Phokian  koinon,an  archon  and  a  grammateus, and  a  witness  to  the  payment  of  the  fine ( CID ii  38.4,6,14\u00ad15; cf.  IG ix.1  111  ( 337/6)). Erochos  was  situated  at  Ano  Souvala  (not  Kato-Souvala as  misprinted  in  Barr.).  The  location  was  definitively estab- lished  by  Tillard  ( 1911)  61\u00ad63  and  has  been  confirmed b y  the discovery  of  a  dedication  to \u00b5    'found in a  sanctuary  of  Demeter  situated  c. 2.5  km  north-east  of  the phokis  417 fortified settlement ( SEG 27  143)  at  Kato-Souvala.  In  the sanctuary  were  found  votive  offerings  of  the  Archaic, Classical  and  Hellenistic  periods  (ArchDelt 27  ( 1972)  Chron. 386).  The  inscriptions  are  published  only  provisionally  and cannot  be  dated  with  precision.  But  since  all  other  attesta- tions  of  toponym  and  ethnic  have  omega,  the  omicron  in [] must stand for an omega.It follows that the ter- minus  ante  quem  of  the  dedication  is  C 4e,  when  omega became  used  for  the  long  sound  and  omicron  was  restricted to  the  short. The  phrase `[]  shows  that  in  C 4e  the  sanctu- ary  was  situated  in  the  territory  of  Erochos  and  that  the toponym could  be  used  to  denote  the  territory  as well  as  the  city.  But  in  the  sanctuary  were  also  found stamped  tiles  inscribed in  letters  datable  to the  Hellenistic  period.  Thus,  at  least  the  sanctuary  was  now controlled  by  the  Lilaieis  (no. 185),  and,  following  Robert and  Robert  (BE  ( 1978)  236),  the  presumption  is  that,  when the  tiles  were  made,  Erochos  had  been  incorporated  into Lilaia.  This  assumption  is  probably  confirmed  by  the  dou- ble  eponymous  archons  attested  in  Lilaia  in  C 3l(F.Delphes iii.4133\u00ad35).  To  have  two  eponymous  officials  is  not  attest- ed  in  any  other  Phokian  polis,  and  a  sympoliteia  with Erochos  offers  a  plausible  explanation  of  the  anomaly. When  the  incorporation  took  place  is  not  known,  but  a  ter- minus  post  quem  is 337/6,  the  date  of  CID ii  38  IG ix.1  111; see  supra. The  town  of  Erochos  was  situated  on  the  top  of  the  hill  of Ag.  Vassilios  and  was  protected  by  a  defence  circuit,  the foundations  of  which  are  still  visible.  The  habitation  quar- ters  seem  to have covered  some  of  the  area  outside  the  wall (Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 10).

The  collective use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  IG ix.110.1\u00ad2. The  individual  and  external  use  is  attested  in  a  proxeny decree  of  C 3  (IG ix.11.4)  and  in  Pausanias'  account  of  the C 6(?)  war  between  the  Phokians  and  the  Thessalians,  where `   \u00b5  was  the  general  of  the  Phokian infantry  (Paus. 10.1.7\u00ad8).  If  one  accepts  the  historicity  of  this war  (but  cf.  Ellinger  ( 1993)  17\u00ad22,  contra  Pritchett  ( 1996))  we have here  the  oldest  attestation  of  Ambryssos  as  a  polis. By C 2s  Ambryssos  and  Phlygonion  (no. 191)  had  formed  a sympoliteia  with  Phlygonion  as  the  subordinate  party,  and  a preserved  delimitation  of  frontiers  (F.Delphes iii.2136) shows  that,  at  least  then,  the  two  communities  bordered  on Delphi  (Rousset  ( 2002)  128,  140,  155\u00ad60). The  dioikismos  suffered  in  346  shows  that  Ambryssos belonged  to  the  Phokian  koinon.  Pausanias  tells  us  that  the defence  circuit  he  saw  had  been  built  by the  Thebans  when they  were at  war  with  Philip  II  of  Makedon,  probably  in  the year  between  the  Theban\u00adAthenian  alliance  of 339  and  the battle  of  Chaironeia  in  338  (Ellis  ( 1994)  781). Ambryssos  had  a  double  defence  circuit  built  by the Thebans  in  339/8  (Paus. 4.31.5,  10.36.3).  But  some  sections  of the  walls  found  during  the  excavations  are  a  little  later (Fossey  ( 1986)  30;  BCH 110  ( 1986)  706,  114  ( 1990)  762;  for  the date,  see  ArchDelt 38  ( 1983)  190\u00ad91).  Pausanias  mentions  a small  agora  of  unknown  date.

Pedieis  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Hdt. 8.33  in  connection  with  Xerxes'  invasion  of  Phokis  in  480, when  the  town  was  burnt  to  the  ground,  and  it  is  listed  as  a polis  in  the  political  sense  in  the  Delphic  naopoioi  accounts, where  the  Pedieis  appear  as  contributors  in  a  list  dated between  373  and 346  (CID ii  5.ii.55)  and  headed  by  the  for- mula:  \u00b5    ( ii.25\u00ad26).  This  list  testi- fies t o  the  collective  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic. In 395  the  Boiotians  overran  the  plain  round  Elateia  and Pedieis  (no. 189),and  the  population  settled  in  the  plain  (Hell. Oxy. 21.5).  Pedieis  is  not  listed  by  Pausanias  among  the  poleis exposed  to dioikismos  in 346;  but  that  Pedieis  was  still  a  mem- ber  of  the  Phokian  koinon  in  C 4f  can  be  inferred  from  the Boiotian  attack  in  395  and  the  occurrence  of  the  city-ethnic  in CID ii  5.ii.54:  [ ]  ),  dated  between  373  and 346.  The  presumption  is  that  Pausanias  omitted  the  city  from his  list  by  mistake,  and  that  it  disappeared  for  good  in  346  (cf. Parapotamioi  (no. 188)).But,depending  on  the  date  of  CID ii 5,  Pedieis  may  have  disappeared  earlier,  which  would  also explain  Pausanias'silence.  For  some  historians'unconvincing link  between  Ledon  (no. 184)  and  Pedieis,  see  supra 420. Pedieis  is  still  unlocated.  The  toponym  as  well  as  the account  of  Hell.  Oxy.  indicate  that  the  city  was  situated  in  the plain,  and  probably  adjacent  to  Elateia  (no. 180).  In  Hdt. 8.33,  Pedieis  is  placed  between  Neon  (no. 187)  and  Triteis (no. 196),  itself  an  unlocated  town.  Consequently,  Pedieis  is normally  identified w ith  the  ancient  site  of  Palaia  Phiva (Schober  ( 1924)  38;  Klaffenbach  ( 1937);  Barr.).  The  remains described  by  early  travellers  are  no  longer  visible  (Ulrichs ( 1863)  ii. 119;  Frazer  ( 1898)  407;  Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 26):  viz.a quadrangular  defence  circuit  with  a  side  of  c. 790  m  and interval  towers,  semicircular  on  the  outside  and  rectangular on  the  inner  side.  Such  a  description  does  not  fit an A rchaic wall,  and  accordingly  Klaffenbach  ( 1937)  preferred  to identi- fy  this  site  with  the  later  site  of  Ledon  (Paus. 10.33.1).But  that remains  a  doubtful  hypothesis.  The  recently  described defence  circuit  at  Vourlia  (Rousset  ( 1999)  no. 16)  is  an  alter- native  candidate  according  to  Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 20. 190.

At SEG 3345.3,  the  restoration  of [ ]  is  not  beyond  suspicion.

Oxy. 21.5  in  connection  with  the  Boiotian  campaign  into Phokis  in  395  (Hansen  and  Nielsen  ( 2000)  146).

Oxy. 21.5;  SEG 42  479.4  (C 3).  The  individual  and  exter- nal  use  is  applied  to  the  Phokian  from  Phanoteus  who  in  424 told  the  Lakedaimonians  about  the  Athenian  plan  to  attack Boiotia  (Thuc. 4.89.1)  and  to  an  exile  who  in  C 4s  con- tributed  to  the  rebuilding  of  the  temple  in  Delphi  (CID ii 24.ii.14).

It  is  implicitly  called  a  polis  by Hell.  Oxy. 21.5  in  connection  with  the  Boiotian  campaign  into  Phokis  in 395,  where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense  with  the  political sense  as  a  possible  connotation  (Hansen  and  Nielsen  ( 2000) 146).  The  collective  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  in  Hell.  Oxy. 21.5.The  only  attestation  of  the  individ- ual  and  external  use  is  Pausanias'  mention  of  an  \u00b5 \u00b5,  allegedly  a  victor  in  the  first Pythian Games  of 586  ( 10.33.7).  The  merging  of  the  toponym  and  the city-ethnic  makes  it  difficult t o  distinguish  between  attesta- tions  of  the  city-ethnic  (found  at  Hell.  Oxy. 21.5:  \u00b5 )  and  the  toponym  (found  at  Plut. Sull. 16.12:   \u00b5). Parapotamioi  was  situated  on  the  north-western  side  of  a hill  called  `,  at  a  strategic  point  controlling  the access  to  the  Kephisos  valley  and  close  to  the  frontier  of Phokis  (schol.  Dem. 19.148,  nos. 313\u00ad14c,  Dilts;  cf.  Daviero- Rocchi ( 1993)).  Owing  to  its  strategic  position,  it  repeatedly became  the  battleground  where  the  Phokian  and  Boiotian armies  clashed  during  the  Third  Sacred  War  (Theopomp.  fr. 385  Strabo  9.3.16;  schol.  Dem. 19.20,no.  73b,  Dilts;  cf.  Plut. Sull. 16.8). At Hell.  Oxy. 21.5  the  territory is  referred  to as   \u00b5 .  According  to  Theopomp.  fr. 385, Parapotamioi  bordered  on  the  poleis  of  Ambryssos  (no. 171), Phanoteus  (no. 190)  and  Daulis  (no. 176).  (Ambryssos  is  a mistake,  but  so  far  no  satisfactory  emendation  has  been  suggested  (Fossey  ( 1986)  69;  Marcotte  ( 1988)  489;  cf.  the comment  in  the  Bud\u00e9  edn.  ad  loc.). Parapotamioi  was  never  rebuilt  after  the  dioikismos  in 346,  but  its  population  was  distributed  between  the  other poleis  refounded  in  the  330s  by  the  Boiotians  and  Athenians (Paus. 10.33.8  (rC 4s);  cf.  Plut.  Sull. 16.12;Strabo 9.3.16).  The polis  ceased  to  exist,  and  its  territory  was  presumably  divid- ed  among  some  or  all  of  the  neighbouring  poleis. Parapotamioi  had  a  small  defence  circuit  of  c. 100  m 80 m  (Fossey  ( 1986)  69\u00ad71;  Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 51).  The  wall  was built  of  small  stones  in  Lesbian  polygonal  masonry.  The workmanship  is  undistinguished,  and  the  wall  is  difficult t o date  (Frazer  ( 1898)  419;  Fossey  ( 1986)  69).

Pausanias  was  the  only  source  for  Echedameia  until  the  dis- covery  in 1863  (Wescher-Foucart)  of  a  Delphic  manumission inscription  of 194  (SGDI 1983)  in  which  both  the  vendors  and one  of  the  guarantors  are  recorded  with  the  city-ethnic '\u00b5  as  the  second  part  of  their  name.  The  two  ven- dors  are  further  described  as  living  in  Tithronion. Echedamia  is  still  unlocated.  Its  absence  from  the  list  of cities  sacked  by  the  Persians  in  480  has  induced  some  schol- ars  to  assume  a  location  in  the  southern  part  of  Phokis (Bursian  ( 1862)  1.182),  but  Lilaia  is  likewise  absent  from  the list,  which  calls  for  circumspection.  No  topographical  con- clusion  can  be  based  on  the  fact  that  two  Echedamieis  were living  in  Tithronion  (SGDI 1983). 180. ", "Elateia": "Identifier: 181. , (Elateus) Map  55.

Elateia  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at 416 oulhen Hdt. 8.33,  and  in  Ps.-Skylax  61  Elateia  is  the  third  toponym listed  after  the  heading  ... ,  where polis  is  again used  in  the  urban  sense;  the  political  sense  is  found  in  IG ix.1 130.2  (C 4).  The  collective  and  internal  use  of  the  city-ethnic is  attested  internally  in  a  Hellenistic  proxeny  decree  (IG ix.1 100.1:   '  (C 3l)).  The  individual  and external  use  is  found  in  a  Delphic  proxeny  decree  of  C 4s (BCH 73  ( 1949)  263  no. 11.4\u00ad5). The  territory is  called  '  (Theophr.  Hist.  pl. 8.8.2) and  it  covered  a  large  part  of  the  Kephisos  valley  (Hell.  Oxy. 21.5;Plut.  Sull. 16.1:  ' ).  Elateia  controlled the  valley,  and  its  strategic  importance  is  frequently  attested (Dem. 18.169;Diod.  16.84.2;Strabo 9.3.2;  see  Pritchett  ( 1982) 123\u00ad75).  In  later  sources  Elateia  is  repeatedly,  and  sometimes retrospectively,  singled  out  as  the  largest  of  the  Phokian poleis  (schol.  Dem. 18  no. 262,Dilts;  Harp. 32;Strabo 9.2.19; Paus. 10.3.2,  34.1;  Steph.  Byz. 264.3).  The  exact  size  of  the  ter- ritory  is  unknown,  but  the  possible  disappearance  of  Pedieis (no. 189)  after  346  and  the  unquestionable  diappearance  of Parapotamioi  (no. 188)  may  have  made  Elateia  the  largest polis  of  Phokis.  Thus,  Elateia  came  to  control  the  main  pass between  Phokis  and  Boiotia,  which  would  explain  the Athenian  panic  in  339  at  the  news  of  the  fall  of  the  city  (Dem. 18.169). Like  the  other  Phokian  poleis,  Elateia  was  sacked  and  the city  burned  down by the  Persians  in  480  (Hdt. 8.33).  In  395 the  Boiotians  overran  the  plain  around  Elateia  and  Pedieis (no. 189),  and  the  population  settled  in  the  plain  (Hell.  Oxy. 21.5).  In  346  it  was  one  of  the  cities  dioikised  by  Philip  (Paus. 10.3.1).  Membership  of  the  Phokian  koinon  is  ensured  by  the recording  in  C 4s  of  two  Elateians  among  the  archontes  of  the Phokians  (CID ii  38.3\u00ad5)  and  by  the  Phokian  dedication  in Delphi  in  304  and 301  celebrating  the  liberation  of  Elateia (F.Delphes iii.4219;  Paus. 1.26.3,  10.18.7,  34.2;  cf.  Flaceli\u00e8re ( 1937)  47,  53\u00ad55,  61;  Jacquemin  ( 1999)  347). The  principal  divinity  of  Elateia  was  Athena  Kranaia (Paus. 10.34.7).  Enactments  of  the  Phokian  koinon  were  set up  in  her  sanctuary  from  at  least  C 4  onwards.  The  records  of the  payments  of  the  Phokian  fine t o  Delphi  were  found  there (IG ix.1109\u00ad15  CID ii  37\u00ad42;  cf.  also  IG ix.196  (C 3)). Excavations  of  the  sanctuary  have  revealed  remains  of  the Archaic  and  Classical  periods  (Paris  ( 1892)  253\u00ad99). According  to  a  tradition  reported  by  Paus. 8.4.4,  10.34.2\u00ad3 and  attested  already  in  C 2  (SEG 11  1107  (C 2e);  Paus. 7.15.5 (rC 2m);  cf.  Habicht  ( 1998)  67\u00ad69),  Elateia  was  founded  by the  Arkadian  Elatos,  the  son  of  Arkas.  If  it  is  true  that  the  C 5 Delphic  statue  group  of  Zeus,  Kallisto  and  Elatos  was  dedi- cated  by  the  Elateians,  this  foundation  myth  can  be  traced back  to  the  Classical  period.  However,  the  attribution  of  the group  to  the  Elateians  is  not  above  suspicion  (F.Delphes iii.4 142\u00ad44  (C 5  reinscribed  in  C 4;  see  Jacquemin  ( 1999)  53)). In C 5  Elateia  had  a  defence  circuit,  part  of  which  collapsed in  the  earthquake  of 426  (Demetrios  of  Kallatis  (FGrHist 85) fr. 6).An  anecdote  of  doubtful  value  reports  a  siege  of  Elateia by  Pelopidas  in  374  and  refers  to  the  gates  of  the  wall (Polyaen. 2.38.1;  cf.  Schober  ( 1924)  69,  contra  Ellinger  ( 1993) 332).The  defence  circuit,  or  at  least  part  of  it,  must  have  been destroyed  as  a  consequence  of  the  dioikismos  in 346,  as  is confirmed b y  Demosthenes,  who  in  344  told  the  Athenians that  there  were  rumours  that  Philip  intended  to  have  Elateia fortified (Dem. 6.14).  In  338,  after  his  capture  of  Elateia, Philip  built  a  palisade  and  placed  a  garrison  in  the  city (Aeschin. 3.140).  In  C 2e  both  the  acropolis  and  the  lower town  were  protected  by  a  circuit  (Livy  32.24).  Remains  of walls  in  polygonal  masonry  were  reported  by  ninettenth- century  travellers  (Lolling  ( 1989)  177;  Paris  ( 1892)  25\u00ad33).All that  can  be  seen  today  are  some  parts  of  a  wall  in  Lesbian masonry  and  some  of  one  in  isodomic  masonry  (Dassios ( 1992)  no. 38).  The  wall  in  isodomic  masonry  uncovered  in the  early  twentieth  century  is  undoubtedly  the  circuit enclosing  the  lower  town  (Paris  ( 1892)  39). The  Archaic-looking  drachm  with  the  legend (retr.)  recorded  in  Head,  HN \u00b2342  is  rejected as  a  forgery  by  Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 3.  317\u00ad18  n. 2. 181.

The  toponym  recorded  in inscriptions  and  in  authors  of  the  Classical  period  is ,  (SGDI 2118.3  (C 2e);  Thuc. 2.29.3;  Hell.  Oxy. 21.5, Chambers),  in  later  literary  sources  (Steph.  Byz. 221.10;  Eust.  Il. 2.520).  Nevertheless,  the  lexicographers  treat this  form  as  recent  (Steph.  Byz. 221.10;  Etym.  Magn. 250.7), compared  with  ,-  ,  attested  in  the  Catalogue  of Ships  (Hom.  Il. 2.520).  The  Homeric  form  is  probably  the reason  why  Daulis  is  the  only  form  attested  in  Strabo  ( 7.7.1, 9.3.1,  13)  and  Pausanias  ( 10.3.1,  35.8).  The  form  ,   is  found  once  in  Polyb. 4.25.2  (rC 3s).  The  restoration  of  the proxeny  decree  for  [ ]  [ ]    [] (ArchEph  ( 1907)  102  (C 1))  is  questionable,  and  a  preferable restoration  is  '&lt;&gt;.  The  city-ethnic  is   attested  both  in  inscriptions  (SGDI 1969.5  (C 2e))  and  in  lit- erary  sources  (Aesch.  Cho. 674;  Theopomp.  fr. 385;  Paus. 10.4.9),  whereas  is  found  exclusively  in  literary sources  (Hdt. 8.35.1;  Hell.  Oxy. 21.5). Daulis  is  called  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Hdt. 8.35.1  in connection  with  Xerxes'  invasion  of  Greece  in  480,  when Daulis  was  burnt  to  the  ground,  and  by  Hell.  Oxy. 21.5  in connection  with  a  Theban  attack  on  some  Phokian  cities  in 395.  In  both  passages  the  political  sense  is  a  connotation (Hansen  ( 2000)  176).  The  collective use  of  the  ethnic  is attested  internally  in  a  decree  of  C 2s  passed  by  the  polis  of the  Daulieis  (BCH 59  ( 1935)  206\u00ad7)  and  externally  in  texts  of the  Classical  period  (Hdt. 8.35.1  and  Hell.  Oxy. 21.5).  The individual  and  external  use  is  attested  in  a  C 4s  Delphic account  in  which  a  Daulian  grammateus  witnesses  the  pay- ment  of  the  fine imposed on the Phokians poleis  (CID ii 112.11:[ ] \u00b5[---]).  Daulis  is  recorded  by  Paus. 10.3.2  among  the  cities  exposed  to  dioikismos  in 346,  which shows  that  it  belonged  to  the  Phokian  koinon,  an  inference further  confirmed b y  the  Daulian  citizen  who  witnessed  the payment  of  the  fine ( supra).  The  territory  is  indirectly termed at  Hell.  Oxy. 21.5. In 395  the  Boiotians  failed  to  conquer  Daulis  (Hell.  Oxy. 21.5).  The  abortive  attack  suggests  that  Daulis  was  fortified; but  the  location  of  Daulis  on  the  top  of  a  steep  hill  may  in itself  have  provided  sufficient protection.  The  undated remains  of  the  ancient  defence  circuit  enclose  an  area  of phokis  411 c. 200 250  m  (Frazer  ( 1898)  222;  Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 54). Some  sections  are  in  polygonal  masonry,  some  in  trape- zoidal,  which  is  interpreted  by  Scranton  ( 1941)  162  and 172  as evidence  of  successive phases  of  construction.  The  principal gate  in  the  western  side  of  the  wall  is  cautiously  dated  by Winter  ( 1971)  216  as  \"late  Classical  or  Hellenistic\".A  terminus ante  quem  is,  in  any  case, 198,when  Daulis  was  conquered  by the  Romans  (Livy  32.18.7). 177.Delphoi  (Delphos) Map  55.  Lat. 38.30,long.  32.30. Size of  territory:  probably 2  or 3.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is normally  , (Hdt. 1.50.1;  Pl.  Ap. 20E;  F.Delphes iii.1 68.1  (c. 400));  the  epichoric  form  is  sometimes   (coins  (infra);  F.Delphes  III. 1294.13  (C 5l/C4e)).  The Boiotian  form  is  (Syll. \u00b3201.23  (C 4m)).  The toponym  is  used  with  the  definite article (    )  only rarely  (Diod. 16.27.3).  Referring  to  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo rather  than  the  town  of  Delphi,  poets  prefer  the  toponym (Hom.  Il. 2.519;Soph.  OT 152)  or  (Hymn. Hom.  Ap. 372;Ar.Av.188\u00ad89).In prose  often  denotes the  whole  settlement,  of  which  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo  was only  a  part  (Thuc. 1.112.5),  but  sometimes  the  sanctuary alone  (Thuc. 3.57.2).  In  Hymn.  Hom.  Ap. 269  the  use  of  the toponym  Krisa  to  designate  Delphi  is  aetiological  (Lerat ( 1948),  contra  Skorda  ( 1992)  62\u00ad63).  For  the  toponym  Krisa, see 419.  The  city-ethnic  is  (Bacchyl. 3.21,  Maehler; CID i8.1  (c. 400)).  Delphi  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban sense  (Hdt. 8.36.2;  Ps.-Skylax 37)  and  in  the  political  sense (CID i9A.2\u00ad3  (C 4m)).  The  earliest  epigraphical  attestation of  a      is  of 363/2  (IG ii\u00b2  109a.27;  cf.  CID ii 31.1  ( 358/7)).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested internally  in  ktetic  or  abbreviated  form  on  coins  (infra)  and in  decrees  (CID i8  (c. 400);  SEG 16  307.3  (C 4f);  F.Delphes iii.1.391.3  (C 4f))  and  externally  in  inscriptions  (IG iv\u00b2.1 122.77  (C 4))  and  in  literary  sources  (Hdt. 8.36.2;  Aeschin. 3.122).  The  individual  use  is  attested  internally  in  the naopoioi  accounts  (CID ii  10.i.10  ( 357/6))  and  externally  in sepulchral  inscriptions  (IG ii\u00b2  8478: (C 4s))  and  in literary  sources  (Hdt. 5.72.4). It  is  difficult t o  determine  the  exact  relation  between  the sanctuary  of  Apollo  Pythios  and  the  polis  of  Delphi.  As  far  as territory  is  concerned,  as  demonstrated  by  Rousset  ( 2002) passim,  cf. 286\u00ad88,  one  must  distinguish  between  (a)  the  ter- ritory of  the  polis,  called (F.Delphes iii.4175  (C 3l)), in  which  houses  and  landed  property  were  owned  by  the  cit- izens  (CID ii  67.11\u00ad13  (C 4f))  and  controlled  by  them through  grants  of  enktesis  (F.Delphes iii.4378.7: \u00b5 (C 4s));  (b)  land  which  was  part  of ,  but  consecrated to  Apollo  (?)  (cf.  Rousset  ( 2002)  292);  it  was  let  out  to  indi- viduals  (CID ii  67.1)  or  communities  (CID ii  67.5)  and  was  a source  of  income  administered  by  the  Amphiktyony (Sanchez  ( 2001)  142\u00ad44);  (c)  the  hiera chora,  the  former  ter- ritory  of  Krisa/Kirrha(?),  consecrated  to  Apollo  after  the First  Sacred  War;  it  was  administered  by  the  Amphiktyony and  strictly  separated  from  the  territory  of  Delphi  in  the Classical  and  Hellenistic  periods,  see  infra 419\u00ad20. The  extent  of  the  territory  of  Delphi  in  the  Classical  peri- od  is  not  known,  but  the  presumption  is  that  it  was  roughly the  same  as  in  the  Hellenistic  period  (cf.  Rousset  ( 2002) 71\u00ad175).  To  the  west  Delphi  bordered  on  Amphissa  (no. 158) (F.Delphes iii.3383  (C 2e);  Plut.  Mor. 249E\u00adF  (rC 4m));  to  the east  it  bordered  on  the  Phlygonioi  (no. 191),  incorporated into  Delphi  in  C 2e,  whereafter  the  borderland  was  the  terri- tory  owned  in  common  (?)  by  Ambryssians  (no. 171)  and Phlygonians  (F.Delphes iii.2136  (C 2m)).  According  to Strabo  9.3.15  (rC 5m),  the  site  called  Anemoreia  (unlocated) was  made  the  frontier  between  Delphi  and  the  Phokians when  the  Lakedaimonians  cut  Delphi  out  of  the  Phokian koinon.  To  the  south  and  south-west  the  territory  bordered on  the  \"Sacred  Land\"  (cf.  Krisa/Kirrha).  To  the  north,  it  is unknown  how  far  the  territory  stretched  up  Parnassos;  it may  have  reached  the  Korykian  Grotto  (Rousset  ( 2002) 160\u00ad62). We  have  no  information  about  the  total  number  of  cit- izens  (Rousset  ( 2002)  290),  but  the  minimum  number  of adult  male  citizens  can  be  established  from  some  decrees passed  by  the  Delphian  assembly.  When  the  people  voted with  pebbles,  the  decree  passed  sometimes  records  the  num- ber  of  votes  cast,  and  three  such  decrees  are  preserved:  the first r ecords  a  total  of 454  votes  (F.Delphes iii.1294.i.2\u00ad3 (C 4f);  cf.  Rougemont  ( 1998)  164),  the  second  over  400  votes (CID i13.35\u00ad37  (C 4f)),  and  the  third  353  votes  (Lerat  ( 1943) 63).  A  decision  made  in  C 4m  by the  Labyades,  one  of  the civic  subdivisions  (infra 414),was  passed  with  182  votes  (CID i9.A.21\u00ad22). Being  the  seat  of  one  of  the  two  sanctuaries  of  the Pylo\u00adDelphic  Amphiktyony,  Delphi,  as  the  only  polis,had two  seats  in  the  Amphiktyonic  Council  (CID ii  36.i.24\u00ad25 ( 343/2);  cf.  Lef\u00e8vre  ( 1998)  34\u00ad51).  Delphi's  participation  in the  Council  is  securely  attested  in  343/2  (CID ii  36.i.24;  cf. Lef\u00e8vre  ( 1998)  34\u00ad51),  but  probably  antedates  this  occur- rence  (Theopomp.  fr. 63;  cf.  Sanchez  ( 2001)  119).  The  orig- inal  date  of  Delphi's  admission  to  the  Amphiktyony, however,  cannot  be  positively  established  (Sanchez  ( 2001) 118\u00ad20).  It  has  sometimes  been  dated  to  the  Archaic  period and  seen  as  a  consequence  of  the  First  Sacred  War  in  C 6e 412 oulhen (e.g.  Roux  ( 1979)  16\u00ad19).  Alternatively,  it  has  been  dated  to the  Classical  period  and  seen  as  a  consequence  of  the Lakedaimonian  invasion  of  Phokis  in  C 5m  (e.g.  Kahrstedt ( 1953)  750). The  original  position  of  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo,  serving both  the  polis  and  the  Amphiktyony,  promoted  collabora- tion  as  well  as  competition  between  the  two  organisations  in religious  (Lef\u00e8vre  ( 1998)  239),  military  (ibid. 43)  and  finan- cial  (ibid. 257\u00ad64)  matters.  Nevertheless,  the  disputed  view that  the  independence  of  the  polis  was  sometimes  interfered with  by  the  Amphiktyony  may  merely  reflect our ignorance of  the  organisation  and  working  of  the  institutions;  cf.  for example  the  opposed  interpretations  of  the  Amphiktyonic involvement  in  the  exile  of  Astykrates  (Lef\u00e8vre  ( 1998)  49, contra  Sanchez  ( 2001)  142\u00ad44,  171). Geographically,  Delphi  was  situated  in  Phokis  (Hdt. 8.35.1;Eur.  Or. 1094;  Ps.-Skylax 37),  but  the  Delphians refused  to  be  called  Phokians  (Paus. 4.34.11).  Supported  by interested  allies,  the  Delphians  often  clashed  with  the Phokians  who  tried  to  control  the  sanctuary  of  Pythian Apollo. There  is  no  mention  of  Delphi  in  the  sources  for  the  First Sacred  War  against  Kirrha/Krisa  (see  419\u00ad20  and  no. 183).  A number  of  sometimes  conflicting sources c oncern  what modern  scholars  call  the  Second  Sacred  War  (cf.  Thuc. 1.112.4),  in  which  the  Lakedaimonians  opposed  Phokian attempts  to  control  the  resources  of  Apollo's  sanctuary  in Delphi  (schol.  Eur.  Tro. 9;Diod.  16.33.1;  Paus. 10.15.1).  The issue  is  difficult;  thus  it  remains  problematic  that  there  is  no mention  of  the  Amphiktyony  (Sanchez  ( 2001)  106\u00ad9),  and modern  scholars  agree  in  preferring  Thucydides'  account  of a  single  Lakedaimonian  intervention  in  449  ( 1.112.4)  to other  sources'  accounts  of  two  interventions,  one  in  457 (Plut.  Cim. 17.4)  and  one  in  449,  as  well  as  a  Boiotian  inter- vention  (Philoch.  fr. 34a).  Thucydides  reports  that  the Lakedaimonians  took  possession  of  the  sanctuary  and  gave it  to  the  Delphians.  Strabo  ( 9.3.15)  adds  that  the Lakedaimonians  separated  Delphi  from  the  Phokian koinon.  When  the  Lakedaimonians  had  left  Phokis  (Thuc. 1.112.5)--or three y ears  later  (Philoch.  fr. 34b)--the Athenians  sent  an  army,  took  possession  of  Delphi,  and  gave it  to  the  Phokians  (Thuc. 1.112.5).(Sanchez  ( 2001)  116  prefers to  connect  the  Strabo  passage  with  the  Peace  of  Nikias  in  421, and  Meiggs  ( 1972)  423  is  convinced  that  the  Athenian  cam- paign  took  place  immediately  after  the  Lakedaimonians' retreat.) The  status  of  the  polis  of  Delphi  was  guaranteed  in  the Peace  of  Nikias  in  421:  \"The  sanctuary  and  the  temple  at Delphi,  and  the  Delphian  people  shall  be  their  own  masters in  legislation,  in  taxation  and  in  administration  of  justice, both  concerning  their  persons  and  their  territory,  according to  their  ancestral  customs\"  (Thuc. 5.18.2;  cf.  Hornblower ( 1996)  472).This  clause  probably  means  that  Delphi  was  free of  the  Phokian  koinon  after  421,  and  this  state  of  affairs seems  to  have  persisted  in  356  when,  at  the  beginning  of  the Third  Sacred  War,  the  Phokians  justified their occupation of the  sanctuary  with  a  reference  to  their  ancestral  right  to  the oracle.  Such  a  legitimation  would  have  been  superfluous if Delphi  had  been  a  member  of  the  Phokian  koinon.  It  was  in all  cases  the  Delphians  who  made  decisions  about  access  to the  oracle,  granted  to  the  Phaselitans  (no. 942)  (CID i8 (c. 400)  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 218)  and  the  Asklepiadai  (CID i11 (C 4s?)),  and  the  Skiathians  (no. 520)  (CID i11  (C 4s?) Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 295).  There  is  no  evidence  that,  during  the Sacred  War,  the  Delphians  were  forced  to  join  the  koinon.On the  contrary,  independence  of  the  koinon  is  indicated  by  the fact  that  the  Delphians  kept  their  seats  in  the  Amphictyony while  the  Phokians  were  excluded  in  346. Internal  strife  in,  probably,  C 4f  is  indicated  by  the  men- tion  of  penalties  for  \"organisation  of  stasis\"([ ]   [] in the so-called Law of  Kadys  (BCH 50 ( 1926)  18.vii.14).  In,  presumably,  C 4e  (but  cf.  Rougemont ( 1998)  161\u00ad62),  the  first of  a  number  of  staseis  was  caused  by the  dispute  between  two  Delphic  families  (Arist.  Pol. 1303b37\u00ad4a3;  Heracl.  Lemb. 52;Plut.  Mor. 825B\u00adC;  Carr\u00e8re ( 1984)).  In  363,  Astykrates  and  his  associates,  all  Delphian citizens,  were  exiled  by  the  Amphiktyonic  Council  and  fled to  Athens,  where  they  obtained  Athenian  citizenship  (IG ii\u00b2 109).  Their  property  was  confiscated and leased as property belonging  to Apollo  (CID ii  67\u00ad72  (C 4s)).  Perhaps  their  enemies  were,  in  turn,  sent  into  exile  a  little  later  (CID ii  73 (C 4m)).  This  episode  is  often  seen  as  reflecting inter- national  interference  in  the  government  of  Delphi  in  C 4f (Pomtow  ( 1906);  cf.  Syll. \u00b3175\u00ad78;  Buckler  ( 1985);  contra Sanchez  ( 2001)  170).  The  penalty  of  exile,  however,  is  attest- ed  already  in  C 5e,  when  the  Delphian  Kobon  was  exiled  for having  subverted  the  Pythia  (Hdt. 6.66). The  Aristotelian  collection  of  politeiai  included  a  consti- tution  of  the  Delphians  (fr. 494;  see  Musielak  ( 1993)).  In  C 2 Delphi  was  a  democracy  (Gauthier  ( 1992)).  The  constitu- tion  of  the  Classical  period  has  often  been  interpreted  as  an oligarchy  (Roux  ( 1979)  61\u00ad93;  Salviat  ( 1984);  contra  Gauthier ( 1990);  Musielak  ( 1993)),  but,  pace  Roux  ( 1979)  62\u00ad65,  there is  no  basis  for  the  view  that  the  citizens  were  divided  into two  classes  with  different  political  rights.  There  was  a  popu- lar  assembly  (Lerat  ( 1943)  70\u00ad79),  to which  apparently  all phokis  413 citizens  were  admitted  (contra  Roux  ( 1979)  70);  it  was  called (F.Delphes iii.1294.i.1  (C 4f)),  which  is  the  ancient term (Lerat  ( 1943)  74),  and  later  (CID ii  32.58\u00ad60 (C 4s)).  An  ordinary  meeting  of  this  assembly  was  called .  The  formula  \u00b5     \u00b5  is  not attested  before  C 3,  but  similar  phrases  show  that  a  quorum was  also  required  in  C 4: [  ]    (Syll. \u00b3257.14 ( 340/39)),  or  \u00b5     (Syll. \u00b3265.3 ( 336/5);  cf.  Lerat  ( 1943);  Gauthier  ( 1990)  86\u00ad89).  Further- more,  three  documents  record  the  number  of  votes  cast  in favour  of  the  motion  (Gauthier  ( 1990)  87):  454  votes (F.Delphes iii.1294.i.2\u00ad3  (C 4f)),  400 (CID i13.35\u00ad37 (C 4f)),  and  353  (Lerat  ( 1943)  63);  for  another  fragmentary attestation,  see  Salviat  and  Vatin  ( 1971)  52.  The  quorum  is not  known,  but  the  strange  formulation  of  CID i13  suggests that  it  could  have  been  400  votes  (Roux  ( 1979)  69).The  deci- sions  passed  by  the  assembly  were  tethmoi  (F.Delphes iii.1 294.i.1: '  \u00b5) or nomoi  (Lerat  ( 1943)  62:  \u00b5[ ] ),  or  treaties  (CID \u017813  (C 4f))  or  honorific decrees  (Syll. \u00b3265  ( 336/5)).  The  boula  had  thirty  members, divided  into  two  sections  of  fifteen members,  each  serving six  months  (CID  II 32.78\u00ad86;  cf.  Roux  ( 1979)  71\u00ad77);  the  view that  it  may  have  been  further  subdivided  into  subsections  is unconvincing  (Tr\u00e9heux  ( 1980)  523\u00ad24).There  is  no  evidence of  probouleusis  before  C 2  (Gauthier  ( 1992)  123\u00ad26).In  C 4  the powers  of  the  Council  were  primarily  judicial  and  financial (Roux  ( 1979)  76\u00ad77;  Salviat  ( 1984)).It  did  not,  however,  pos- sess  full  powers  in  either  judicial  matters  (Gauthier  ( 1992) 130)  or  in  financial administration,  where,  at  least  on  one occasion,  the  boula  was  assisted  by  a  board  of  thirteen        (CID ii  32.26\u00ad29  (C 4s);  cf. Bousquet  ( 1988)  184;  Roux  ( 1979)  71,  76\u00ad77).  There  is  no information  about  the  composition  of  the  Delphian  law- courts  in  C 5\u00adC4,  but  the  existence  of  lawcourts  in  C 4m  is ensured  by the  grant  of     (F.Delphes iii.1392.7\u00ad8).  A  C 4  law  on  maltreatment  of  parents  men- tions  a  public  prison  (Lerat  ( 1943)  63: \u00b5 ). The  archon  who  was  the  eponymous  official is indisputably attested  in  C 4f(F.Delphes  iii.1391),  possibly  in  C 6  (Roux ( 1969)  47;  contra  Rougemont  ( 1998)  161\u00ad62),  and  perhaps even  in  C 6e  (Pind.  Hyp.  Pyth.  b).  He  must  be  distinguished from  the  board  of  eight  prytaneis,  a  financial magistracy in charge  of  the  sacred  treasures  of  Apollo  (Bousquet  ( 1988) 143m;  contra  Roux  ( 1979)  81\u00ad92). Of  the  civic  subdivisions,  phylai  are  not  attested  earlier than  C 2  (F.Delphes iii.3238.10\u00ad11),  and  their  number  is unknown  (for  a  hypothesis,  see  Roux  ( 1979)  88).  An  enfran- chisement  act  of  C 1  (F.Delphes iii.679)  mentions  money lent  by  the  tribe   .  The  entry   in  Hsch. 436  is  the  only  explicit  attestation  of  phratriai. The  Labyades  are  often  called  a  phratria  (cf.  CID i  p. 43  n. 68);  however,  we  have  no  explicit  evidence  (Sebillote ( 1997)),  but  the  mention  of  Poseidon  Phratrios  in  CID i 9.B.13\u00ad14  supports  the  view.  The  Labyades  are  first attested in,  presumably,  C 6l  (CID i1.9  bis;  Roux  ( 1969)  47\u00ad56).  In C 4m  they  had  an  assembly  (alia  A. 41),  some  of  its  decisions required  a  quorum  of 101  votes  (B. 9\u00ad10),  and  one  of  the enactments  was  passed  with  182  votes  (A. 21\u00ad23).  The  group had  laws  (A. 3)  and  magistrates  (tagoi:A. 23,  damiorgoi: D. 19\u00ad20);  they  performed  public  functions  which  in  Attika were  performed  by  the  phratriai  (CID i  pp. 26\u00ad88).  The group  was  subdivided  into  patriai.  In  the  Law  of  Kadys  on interest  on  loans  (BCH 50  ( 1926)  15.9\u00ad10)  a  patria  is  men- tioned  alongside  other  groups  called  and ,  which  may  or  may  not  have  been  civic  subdivi- sions.  We are  totally  ignorant  of  the  nature  of  the  Thrakidai mentioned  at  Diod. 16.24.3  in  connection  with  the Phokians'  occupation  of  the  sanctuary  in  356. In C 4s  the  Delphians  conferred  proxenia  and  other  hon- ours  on  citizens  from  e.g.  Selinous  (no. 44),  Pellene  (no. 240),  Arethousa  (no. 546)  and  Phleious  (no. 355)  (F.Delphes iii.1391,  395,  396;  SEG 16  309).A  citizen  of  Delphi  was  grant- ed  proxenia  by  the  Athenians  (no. 361)  in  C 4e  (IG ii\u00b2  51).  In C 6l  Timesitheos  of  Delphi  was  victorious  in  the  Olympic and  in  the  Pythian  Games  (Olympionikai 140,  146;  Hdt. 5.72.4;  Paus. 6.8.6). Apollo  Pythios  was  the  protective  divinity  of  the Delphians  (CID i10.8,  35  (C 4e)).  The  Delphians  controlled the  oracle;  they  had  the  exclusive right  to grant  promanteia, and  themselves  possessed  the  first claim t o  consult  the  ora- cle  (F.Delphes iii.4375  (C 4m);  Pouilloux  ( 1952)).  Strangers needed  the  assistance  of  Delphian  proxenoi  in  order  to con- sult  the  oracle  (CID i5.4  (C 5?);  Syll. \u00b3548  (C 3s);  cf.  Gauthier ( 1972)  46\u00ad52;  Pouilloux  ( 1974)).  Treaties  about  consultation of  the  oracle  were  concluded  between  Delphi  and  Phaselis (no. 942)  (CID i8;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 218  (c. 400))  and  Delphi and  Skiathos  (no. 520)  (CID i13  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 295  (C 4f)). Some  of  the  revenues  of  the  Delphians,  such  as  the  pelanos, were  directly  connected  with  the  oracle  (Amandry  ( 1950) 86\u00ad103;  cf.  CID i11:     ).  The  temple  of Apollo  was,  if  not  the  property,  then  at  least  the  possession of  the  Amphiktyones.  In C 6l  (La  Coste-Messeli\u00e8re  ( 1946)), when  the  Amphiktyones  had  undertaken  for  the  sum  of 300 talents  to  reconstruct  the  temple,  the  Delphians  had  to  pay  a quarter  of  the  costs  and  send  out  envoys  to the  various  poleis to  ask  for  contributions  (Hdt. 2.180).Remains  of  this  temple 414 oulhen are  preserved,  whereas  the  attribution  to the  previous  tem- ple  of  some  architectural  remains  of  C 7  is  still  a  moot  point (Bommelaer  ( 1991)  181\u00ad84).  The  Amphiktyony  organised the  Pythian  Games,  but  the  theoroi  who  performed  the epangelia  were  sent  out  by  the  Delphians  (CID i10.45\u00ad46 ( 380)  with  pp. 118\u00ad19;  SEG 24  379  (C 4m);  cf.  Sourvinou- Inwood  ( 1990)  299).  These  theoroi  were  hosted  by  theo- rodokoi  appointed  by  the  Delphian  polis  (Daux  ( 1949) 4\u00ad11  Syll. \u00b390  (C 5s?);  F.Delphes iii.44  (C 4s)).  Conversely,  a Delphian  theorodokos  was  appointed  to  host  theoroi  from Epidauros  (no. 348)  in  356  (IG iv\u00b2.195.3).  The  other  major sanctuary  of  the  Delphian  polis  was  that  of  Athena  (Hdt. 8.39),  whose  temple  of  the  Archaic  period  has  been  dated  to C 7\u00adC6  (Bommelaer  ( 1991)  56\u00ad59).  Cults  of  other  gods  are known,  but  their  existence  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  peri- ods  is  often  unattested  (Pomtow  ( 1912);  Roux  ( 1976) 165\u00ad208).  For  the  religious  festivals,  see  CID i58\u00ad60. Apart  from  remains  of  the  Mycenaean  period  (S.  M\u00fcller ( 1992)  455\u00ad90),  evidence  of  a  settlement  within  the  sanctu- ary  can  be  traced  back  to C 10,  and  remains  of  a  house  have been  dated  to  C 8m  (Luce  ( 1993)).  The  earliest  dedications  to Apollo(?)  date  from  C 9l  (Rolley  ( 1977)  135),  and  the  first traces  of  the  administration  of  the  sanctuary  can  be  dated  to C 7e  (La  Coste-Messeli\u00e8re  ( 1969)  731\u00ad40).  The  first peribolos of  c. 575  may  be  connected  with  the  formation  of  the Amphiktyony  in  Delphi  (Luce  ( 1992)  704).  In its  original form  the  fountain  of  Kastalia  may  date  from  C 7l\u00adC6m (Bommelaer  ( 1991)  81\u00ad83).  The  Pythian  hippodrome  and stadion  were  probably  placed  in  the  Kirrhaian  plain  in  the Classical  period  (Bommelaer  ( 1991)  215;  cf.  infra 419). The  Panhellenic  sanctuary  at  Delphi  has  been  excavated and  studied  in  detail  by,  principally,  the  French  school.  The sanctuary  ( 2.3  ha)  is  densely  built  and  centres  on  the  so- called  Sacred  Way  which  winds  its  way  down  the  slopes  of the  temenos.  The  most  conspicuous  features  are:  ( 1)  the  C 4 Doric  peripteral  ( 6  15)  temple  of  Apollo,  which  dominates the  sanctuary;  built  after  the  earthquake  of 373,  it  replaced  a monumental  C 6  temple  adorned  with  pedimental  sculp- tures,  which  itself  replaced  one  or  more  earlier  buildings. Later  tradition  locates  the  oracle  of  Apollo  in  an  under- ground  chamber  of  the  temple,  no  trace  of  which,  however, has  been  found  (Bommelaer  ( 1991)  176\u00ad84);  ( 2)  a C 4\u00adHellenistic  theatre  (TGR  ii. 188\u00ad90;  Bommelaer  ( 1991) 207\u00ad12);  ( 3)  the  treasuries:  twenty  buildings  among  the numerous  constructions  in  the  sanctuary  have  been  identi- fied,  with  varying  degrees  of  certainty,  as  treasuries  dedicat- ed  by  individual  Greek  poleis  or  even  non-Greek  polities  (cf. Strabo  5.1.3  (Etruscan  Agylla));  apparently,  most  treasuries were  constructed  prior  to  the  Hellenistic  period,  but  the attribution  of  individual  buildings  to  specific poleis  depends largely  on  Pausanias.  The  poleis  known to have constructed treasuries  are  (numerals  prefaced  with  #  refer  to  pl.  V  in Bommelaer  ( 1991)):  Syracuse  (no. 47),  cf.

The  treasuries  of  the  Athenians,  the Sikyonians  and  the  Siphnians  were  decorated  with  pedi- mental  sculptures  and  reliefs  in  exquisite  late  Archaic  style (Bommelaer  ( 1991)  118\u00ad26,  133\u00ad36).  And  ( 4)  commemora- tive  dedications,  outstanding  among  which  are  e.g.  the Monument  of  the  Admirals,  dedicated  to  commemorate  the Spartan  victory  at  Aigos  potamoi  (cf.  ML  95  ( 405)),  and  the Athenian  thank  offering  for  the  victory  at  Marathon,  hon- ouring  the  commander  Miltiades  (Bommelaer  ( 1991) 108\u00ad11),and,of  course,  the  Greek  thank  offering  for  victories in  the  Persian  War  (ML  27).  For  treasuries  and  other  monu- mental  dedications,  see  the  synthetic  study  by  Jacquemin ( 1999). Below  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo  is  the  sanctuary  of  Athena ( 0.5  ha).  The  central  features  of  this  sanctuary  are,  from  west to  east:  ( 1)  the  C 6l  temple  of  Athena  Pronaia,  which  replaced an  earlier  construction;  it  is  Doric  peripteral  ( 6 12);  ( 2)  a C 5e  Doric  treasury,  of  unknown  ownership;  ( 3)  the  C 6s  Aiolic Treasury  generally  ascribed  to  Massalia  (no. 3),  which  also housed  dedications  by  Rome  (cf.  Diod. 14.93.4  (r 393));  ( 4)  a C 4e  tholos;  and  ( 5)  a  C 4f  Doric  prostyle  hexastyle  temple,  of Athena  or  possibly  Artemis  (Bommelaer  ( 1991)  46\u00ad71). The  town  of  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  is  poorly attested,  and  occasional  references  in  the  inscriptions  are phokis  415 obscure  (on  the  toponym  of  Thuia,  see  Jacquemin  ( 1992)).It  is not  known  where  the  assembly  met  (contra  Roux  ( 1979)  70);  a public  prison  ( \u00b5 ) is mentioned in a C4  text (Lerat  ( 1943)  63);  texts  of  C 2  mention  a  bouleion  (F.Delphes iii.289)  which  has  not  been  securely  located  (Bommelaer ( 1991)  144);  and  the  location  of  the  prytaneion  is  likewise unknown  (CID ii  81.A.16  (C 4s)).  A  dikasterion--either a law- court  or  a  court  room--is mentioned in a C 4f  document (F.Delphes iii.1295,inv.  1373).  The  gymnasion  in  Delphi  is  of C 4s  (Bommelaer  ( 1991)  72\u00ad79).  It  is  commonly  believed  that the  town  of  Delphi  was  unfortified.  The  walls  situated  on  the rocky  ridge  west  of  the  sanctuary  have,  tentatively,  been  attrib- uted  to  Philomelos  (Diod. 16.25.1;  Bommelaer  ( 1991)  217).  The Logari  tower  east  of  the  sanctuary  may  date  from  the  same period  (Bommelaer  ( 1991)  41).  South  of  the  sanctuary  are some  undated  remains  of  walls  (P.

Il. 2.523;  Theopomp.  fr. 385;  Paus. 10.3.1  (rC 4m);  BCH 45  ( 1921) iv.41  (C 2f),  Oulhen).  The  form  is  late  and  is  only found  in  literary  sources  (Ptol.  Geog. 3.14.14;  Suda 538). The  city-ethnic  is  (IG ix.1  111  (C 4s)). Lilaia  is  not  explicitly  called  a  polis  in  any  Archaic  or Classical  source.  Paraphrasing  Theopompos  (fr. 385)  and quoting  the  Homeric  Catalogue  of  Ships  (Il. 2.523),  Strabo classifies Lilaia as a polis  in  the  territorial  sense  ( 9.3.16). Theopompos  is  cited  for  the  information  that  the  river Kephisos  rose  near  Lilaia  (    ...  ).  We  cannot  be  sure,  however,  that  the  term  polis stems  from  Theopompos  (cf.  Jacoby  ad  loc.).  Lilaia  is  retro- spectively  listed  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Paus. 10.3.1, describing  the  dioikismos  of  the  Phokian  poleis  in 346,  and  at 10.33.3  Pausanias  reports  that  the  city  was  refounded (    ),  presumably  in  C 4l  (infra). The  collective  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found in  abbreviated  form  on  some  C 5f  coins  (infra)  and  in  an inscription  of 322  recording  the  Phokians'  payment  of  the fine imposed in  346  (CID ii  108.6).  For  the  individual  and external  use,  see  the  [ ]  and  the  [ ]  who made  a  contribution  to  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo  in  Delphi (CID ii  2.i.6,  9  (C 4f))  and     who  in 337/6  witnessed  the  Phokians'  payment  of  the  fine imposed in 346  (IG ix.1  111.14  CID ii  38). Lilaia  is  not  mentioned  by  Hdt. 8.33,  35,  among  the  cities destroyed  by  the  Persians  in  480.Several  commentators  have suggested  a  topographical  or  historical  explanation  for  the absence  of  Lilaia  from  Herodotos'  list.  For  Valckenaer's unconvincing  conjecture  instead  of  MSS at  Hdt. 8.35,see supra 409.  Some  have taken Herodotos'  omission  of  Lilaia  as  proof  that,  in  480,  the  city was  part  of  Doris  and  had  joined  the  other  Dorian  cities  in siding  with  the  Persians  (Hdt. 8.31;  cf.  Leake  ( 1835)  ii. 89\u00ad90). A  slightly  modified v ersion  of  this  explanation  has  induced Williams  ( 1972)  16\u00ad18  to  interpret  the  coins  inscribed  as an  autonomous  issue  struck  immediately  after  the  Persian invasion.  But  the  coins  are  federal,  and  the  precise  dating  is questionable,  although  stylistic  criteria  do  point  to  a  date  in C 5f(infra).  The  coins,  the  dioikismos  in 346,  and  the  record- ing  of  a  Lilaian  witnessing  the  payment  of  the  Phokians'  fine in 337/6  (IG ix.1  111)  are  sufficient proof  that  Lilaia  was  a member  of  the  Phokian  koinon  in  C 5  and  C 4.  Consequently, the  inclusion  of  Lilaia  as  one  of  a  Dorian  hexapolis  must  be abandoned  (Rousset  ( 1989)  224\u00ad25). After  the  dioikismos  of 346  (Paus. 10.3.2)  Lilaia  was refounded  (Paus. 10.33.3).  Stamped  tiles  of  the  Hellenistic period  (C 3?)  inscribed  have  been  found  in the  sanctuary  of  Artemis  at  Erochos,  from  which  Robert  and Robert (BE  ( 1978)  236)  inferred  that  a  sympoliteia  had resulted  in  the  incorporation  of  Erochos  (no. 181)  into  Lilaia. In  this  context  it  may  be  worth  noting  that  Lilaia  is  the  only Phokian  polis  that  had  two  eponymous  officials,  as  attested in  a  series  of  documents  of  C 3l  (F.Delphes iii.4133\u00ad35). Later  documents  mention  only  one  eponymous  archon (F.Delphes iii.2125  (C 2s)). Lilaia  bordered  to  the  south  on  the  foothills  of  Parnassos, to  the  east  on  a  declivity  dominating  a  small  valley  beneath which  was  the  source  of  the  river  Kephisos.  The  lower  town was  presumably  situated  here  (Frazer  ( 1898)  411\u00ad14;  Dassios ( 1992)  29\u00ad30  no. 5).  Today  only  the  uppermost  part  of  the circuit  wall  is  preserved  (plan  in  Tillard  ( 1911)  70).It  is  a  kind of  acropolis,  and  its  connection  with  the  circuit  wall  enclos- ing  the  lower  town  can  no  longer  be  determined.  It  is  in isodomic  masonry,  with  bevelled  joints,  and  cannot  be dated  with  certainty.  A  date  after  338  was  suggested  by Tillard  ( 1911)  75,  a  date  c. 356\u00ad46  by Ober ( 1992)  163\u00ad64.The wall  is  mentioned  in  connection  with  the  siege  of  Lilaia  by Philip  V  in  C 3l  (Paus. 10.33.3). It  is  uncertain,  however,  whether  Archaic  Lilaia  was  situat- ed  here.  On  a  hill  c. 1  km  north-west  of  the  C 4  fortifications are  remains  of  a  wall  in  polygonal  masonry,  perhaps  of  C 6, covering  an  area  of  c. 100  by 60  m  (Keramopoulos  ( 1917)  53 (C 6?);  Kase  et al.( 1991)  53  pl. 4.14  and 35;  Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 3). Sherds  of  the  early,  middle  and  late  Helladic  periods  have been  found  as  well  (Lazenby  and  Hope  Simpson  ( 1970)  44; Teiresias  ( 1979)  19\u00ad27).  Rather  than  a  second-order  settle- ment  depending  on  Lilaia  (Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 3),  this  site  may well  be  Archaic  Lilaia.  Such  a  hypothesis  is  supported  by  the fact  that  excavations  of  the  Classical  site  of  Lilaia  have  pro- duced  no  material  of  the  Archaic  period  (ArchDelt 33  ( 1978) B 1,  154\u00ad64).  The  hypothesis  disproves  the  topographical argument  adduced  by  Tillard  ( 1911)  63  in  order  to explain  the absence  of  Lilaia  from  Herodotos'  account  at  8.33\u00ad35  (supra). Pausanias  mentions  an  agora  and  a  theatre,  both  undated ( 10.33.4).  The  source  of  the  river  Kephisos  was  traditionally phokis  421 located  at  Lilaia  (Hom.  Il. 2.523;  Theopomp.  fr. 385;  Paus. 9.24.1).  It  was  the  object  of  a  cult  performed  by  the  Lilaians (Paus. 10.8.10),  and  a  priest  of  Kephisos  is  mentioned  in  the documents  of  C 3l  mentioned  above  (F.Delphes iii.4133\u00ad35). A  retaining  wall  in  polygonal  masonry  near  the  source  of  the river  may  be  dated  to  C 6  (Frazer  ( 1898)  414). Some  silver  coins,  usually  dated  to  the  period  480\u00ad421, were  struck  by  the  Phokian  koinon,  but  instead  of the legend  is  ,  probably  an  abbreviated  form  of , indicating  that  they  were  struck  for  Lilaia  in  particular. Denominations:  triobol,  diobol  and  obol  on  the  Aiginetan standard.

Size  of  territory:  probably  2.  Type:  B.  The  toponym  is - ,  (Syll. \u00b3667.36  (C 2  or  C 2f);  Paus. 10.3.2; Steph.  Byz. 439.19).  The  city-ethnic  is  (CID ii 37.3\u00ad4  (C 4s);  SGDI 2057.2  (C 2e)).  Medeon  is  not  called  a polis  in  any  Archaic  or  Classical  source,  and  the  first e xplicit attestation  of  a     is  in  a  C 2e  sympoliteia agreement  between  Medeon  and  Stiris  (no. 193)  (Syll. \u00b3667.6 (C 2  or  C 2f);  cf.  Migeotte  ( 1984)  no. 28);  but  Medeon  is  retrospectively  attested  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Paus. 10.3.2,where  it  is  listed  among  the  Phokian  cities  dioikised  in 346.  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  external- ly  in  an  inscription  of 322  recording  the  Phokians'  payment of  the  fine imposed in  346  (CID ii  108.1:[ ]  ) and internally  in  the  C 2f  sympoliteia  agreement  (supra).  For  the  individual  and  external  use,  see   ,  the  archon  of  the  Phokian  koinon in 342  (CID ii  37.3\u00ad4). The  fate  of  the  city  in  346  as  well  as  the  federal  archon  of 342  ensure  that  Medeon  was  a  member  of  the  Phokian koinon.  There  is  no  other  public  act  of  Medeon  than  the  C 2 sympoliteia  agreement  according  to  which  Medeon  disap- pears  as  a  polis  and  becomes  a  phratria  of  Stiris. The  defence  circuit  surrounding  the  town of  Medeon  is built  in  an  unparalleled  type  of  regular  polygonal  masonry, with  three  towers  in  the  north-western  part  (Camp  ( 2000) 42).  It  measures  200  m  (east\u00adwest)  by  150  m  (north\u00adsouth) (Vatin  ( 1969)  4  fig. 4).  On  the  top  of  the  hill  are  numerous terraces  on  which  are  the  remains  of  some  (public?)  build- ings.  The  cemetery  was  abandoned  in  C 3m,  according  to Robert  and  Robert  (BE  ( 1970)  310)  in  connection  with  the sympoliteia  which  was  probably  entailed  by  a  synoikismos. Only  ruins  were  left  in  the  time  of  Pausanias  ( 10.36.6). 187.Neon (Ne(-))/Tithorea  (Tithoreus) Map  55.  Lat. 38.35,long.  22.40.  Size  of  territory:  probably  2.  Type:  A.  The older  toponym  is  (Hdt. 8.32.1)  or  (Paus. 10.2.4) or (Dem. 19.148)  or  (Androtion  (FGrHist 324)  fr. 23;  Paus. 10.3.2;  cf.  Harding  ( 1994)  119\u00ad20).  The  cor- responding  city-ethnic  is  attested  only  in  abbreviated  form (as ) on some C5  coins  (infra).  Steph.  Byz. 473.11  suggests the  forms  and .  The  later  toponym  is ,  (Hdt. 8.32,  cited  by  Paus. 10.32.8\u00ad9,  in  both sources  designating  a  summit  of  Parnassos).  At  Paus. 10.32.9 the  toponym  is  taken  to  designate  first the r egion  and  later the  town,  replacing  the  older  toponym  of .  The  form is  attested  both  in  texts  and  in  inscriptions  (Plut. Sull. 15.5  (rC 1);  IG ix.1190.2  ( 2nd  century  ad)).  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iii.29,  Oulhen  (C 2f))  and  (CID ii 131.9  (C 3))  are  variant  forms  found  only  in  inscriptions.  The city-ethnic  is  ,  attested  only  in  inscriptions  (IG XI. 199.3  (C 3l)); is  attested  both  in  inscriptions and  in  literary  texts  (IG ix.166.25  (C 2m);  Paus. 10.32.11). is  attested  once  (Paus. 9.17.4). Neon  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Hdt. 8.32.1  and 8.33  and,  retrospectively,  at  Paus. 10.3.2  and 32.9,  in  both authors  in  connection  with  Xerxes'  invasion  of  Phokis  in 480,  when  Neon  was  burnt  to  the  ground.  Pausanias  men- tions  Neon  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  in  connection  with the  battle  of  Neon  in  354  ( 10.2.4)  and  also  in  connection  with the  dioikismos  of  the  Phokian  cities  in  346  after  the  Third Sacred  War  ( 10.3.2\u00ad3).  The  collective  and  internal  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  in  abbreviated  form  ( ) on C5  coins (infra).  All  attestations  of  the  city-ethnic  ()  are Hellenistic  or  later  (supra). The  problem  of  whether  Tithorea  was  built  on  the  top  of the  ruins  of  Neon  depends  on  how  one  interprets  Hdt. 8.32.1 and  the  slightly  different  story  told  by Plut.  Sull. 15.5  and Paus. 10.32.9.  Pace  Leake  ( 1835)  ii. 79  and  Ulrichs  ( 1863)  119, the  preferable  solution  is,  with  Tillard  ( 1911)  56\u00ad60,to follow the  account  found  in  Pausanias:  (a)  in  480  Tithorea  was  the name  of  the  peak  of  the  mountain  towering  over  the  polis  of Neon  (Hdt. 8.32.1;  Paus. 10.32.9);  (b)  the  toponym  Tithorea came  to  designate  the  surrounding  region,  i.e  the  territory of  the  polis  of  Neon  (Paus. 10.32.9:   );  (c)  the polis  of  Neon,  demolished  in  346,  took  the  name  of  Tithorea when  it  was  refounded  on  the  same  site  by  people  returning from  their  temporary  residence  in  the  surrounding  villages (Paus. 10.32.9:      \u00b5).  It  follows that  the  attempts  to  locate  Neon  somewhere  in  the  Kephisos valley  must  be  abandoned  (Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 26,who  ident- ifies N eon  with  Palai  Thiva;  see  Pedieis  (no. 189)).  The  date 422 oulhen of  the  refoundation  is  not  known,  and  the  earliest  attesta- tions  of  the  new  toponym  (CID ii  131)  and  city-ethnic  (IG ix.199)  are  of  C 3. The  federal  coins  inscribed  ,as well the fate of  the  city in 346,  ensure  that  Neon  was  a  member  of  the  Phokian koinon.  The  classification of  Tithorea  as  a  Boiotian  polis  at Steph.  Byz. 623.14  is  probably  just  a  mistake:  the  Theban occupation  of  Neon  during  the  Third  Sacred  War,  from  354 to 349,was  apparently  not  followed  by  a  political  annexation of  the  city  (Paus. 10.2.4;Dem.  19.148;  Buckler  ( 1989)  44\u00ad45, 100\u00ad11). The  events  of 349  (Dem. 19.148)  suggest  that  the  city  was fortified,  but  the  remains  of  fortifications still v isible  may well  be  of  a  later  date.  The  north-eastern  part  of  the  wall with  its  towers  is  in  a  fine state of  preservation,  and  the  date is  much  debated  (after  338:  Tillard  ( 1911)  59\u00ad61,  75;  Winter ( 1971)  158;  c. 356\u00ad46:  Ober  ( 1992)  163\u00ad64).  A  deep  gorge  lay immediately  west  of  the  town,  and  the  town  was  protected by  a  defence  circuit  on  the  northern  and  eastern  sides  only. The  wall  was  built  in  isodomic  masonry  with  interval  tow- ers,  ten  of  which  are  still  visible.  The  wall  enclosed  an  area  of max.  c. 580  m  (north\u00adsouth)  250  m  (east\u00adwest).  Paus. 10.32.10  mentions  a  peribolos  wall  enclosing  an  ancient agora.  He  also  mentions  several  undated  sanctuaries  and  the tomb  of  Antiope  and  Phokos  ( 10.17.4,  32.10).  According  to legend,  the  region  of  Phokis  was  named  after  Phokos,  who settled  at  Tithorea  (Paus. 2.4.3,  29.3,  10.1.1). Some  silver  obols,  usually  dated  to  the  period  480\u00ad421, were  struck  by  the  Phokian  koinon,  but  with  the  legend   on  the  reverse,  probably  an  abbreviated  form  of  the  city- ethnic,  indicating  that  they  were  struck  for  Neon  in  particu- lar.

Byz. 668.12,  is  either  a  mere invention  of  the  grammarians  or  a  misinterpreted  form  of the  name  of  the  territory.  In  inscriptions  of  C 3l  and  C 2e  the city-ethnic  is  invariably  (SGDI 2049  (C 3l);  for  a list  of  attestations,  see  Daux  ( 1936)  234\u00ad58;  Lerat  ( 1952)  i. 59\u00ad60),  but  in  a  C 2m  regulation  of  the  frontiers  the  city-eth- nic  is  (F.Delphes iii.2136.22)  or   (F.Delphes iii.2136.29).  The  only  attestation  of  the  city- ethnic  in  an  inscription  of  the  Classical  period  is  restored, viz.[ ]  or  [ ]  in  CID ii  108.10  ( 322). and are  found  only  in  Steph.  Byz. 668.12  and  are  presumably  invented  by  the  grammarians. Phlygonion  is  recorded  in  Pausanias'  list  of  poleis  exposed to dioikismos  in 346  ( 10.3.2).  Pausanias'  information  is  confirmed b y  the  Delphic  accounts,  where  the  Phlygonians ([ /]) are recorded among the Phokian com- munities  that  paid  the  annual  fine ( CID ii  108.10  ( 322)).Both sources  ensure  that  Phlygonion  belonged  to  the  Phokian koinon  in  C 4.  The  collective  and  external  use  of  the  city- ethnic  is  attested  in  this  inscription.  The  individual  and external  use  is  attested  in  the  Delphic  manumission  inscrip- tions  of  C 3l/C2e  (SGDI 2049.3,  20). The  existence  of  two  different  city-ethnics--viz. versus derived  from  -- has  for  a  long  time  induced  commentators  to  postulate  the existence  of  two  different  cities:  the  Phokian  city  of inhabited  by  the  ,  and  the  Lokrian city  of  * ,  an  unattested  toponym  derived  from the  city-ethnic  (Schober  ( 1924)  39\u00ad40;  Daux ( 1936)  234\u00ad58;  Lerat  ( 1952)  i. 59\u00ad61;  contra  Colin  at  F.Delphes iii.2136),  but  both  city-ethnics  do  in  fact  denote  the  same city  (Rousset  ( 1999)  43  n. 37  and  ( 2002)  20\u00ad27). Although  the  Persians  must  have passed  Phlygonion  on their  march  in  480  from  Phanoteus  to  Delphi,  the  city  is absent  from  Herodotos'  list  at  8.35.  But  no  argument  from silence  can  be  based  on  this  chapter.  The  dioikismos  of Phlygonion  in  346  (Paus. 10.3.2),  as  well  as  the  Phlygonians' contribution  to  the  fine in  322  (CID ii  108)  ensure  that Phlygonion  was  a  member  of  the  Phokian  koinon.The inscriptions  of  C 2f  show  that,  in  191/90,  all  Phlygonians  had become  Delphians  (Daux  ( 1936)  252\u00ad53).  The  C 2m  regula- tion  of  the  frontiers  between  the  Delphians  (no. 177)  and,  on the  other  hand,  the  Ambryssians  (no. 171)  and  Phlygonians shows  that  the  two  latter  cities  by  then  were  united  in  a  sym- politeia  (F.Delphes iii.2136).

The  variant  form  is  attested  once  in an  inscription  of  the  Roman  Imperial  period  (IG ix.148.7 (third  century  ad),  and  is  found  once  (Paus. 10.3.2).  Neither  the  toponym  nor  the  city-ethnic  is  attested prior  to  the  Hellenistic  period;  but  Stiris  is  listed  by  Paus. 10.2.3  as  one  of  the  poleis  exposed  to dioikismos  in 346,which shows  that,  in  C 4m,  it  was  a  member  of  the  Phokian  koinon. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  a  sympoliteia  agreement  with  Medeon  (no. 186)  of  C 2f? (Syll. \u00b3647)  and  externally  in  a  C 3  inscription  which  regu- lates  the  frontier  between  Stiris  and  Phanoteus  (no. 190;  SEG 42  479  (C 3l)).  The  individual  and  external  use  is  found  in  a Delphic  manumission  inscription  of  C 2f(SGDI  1727). Paus. 10.35.10  records  a  sanctuary  of  Demeter  Stiritis  with a  temple  in  mudbrick  in  which  was  a  very  old  image  of  the goddess.  The  epithet  indicates  that  Demeter  was  the  protec- tive  divinity  of  Stiris. Stiris  is  situated  on  a  low  rocky  hill,  c. 700  m  long  and  100 m  across.  Along  the  east  side  are  the  remains  of  an  undated defence  circuit  in  isodomic  masonry  (Fossey  ( 1986)  32\u00ad33; Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 75;  McInerney ( 1999)  319\u00ad20). 194.

Both  sources  show  that  Amphikaia was  a  member  of  the  Phokian  koinon.

Thus,  the  Antikyreis  could  claim  mention  in the  Homeric  Catalogue  of  Ships  (Il. 2.519;  cf.  Paus. 10.3.1). This  invention  of  a  glorious  past  (for  which  see  also  Paus. 10.36.6,  10  and  Steph.  Byz. 99.4\u00ad5)  may  date  from  the  time  of the  Third  Sacred  War  (Diod. 16.23.5\u00ad6).  The  city-ethnic  is (SGDI 1872.8  (C 2f);  Polyb. 9.39.2  (rC 3l)). Antikyra is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skylax  37 and,  retrospectively,  by  Paus. 10.3.1  in  connection  with  the dioikismos  of 346.  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  internally  on  Hellenistic  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2  339)  and in  Hellenistic  proxeny  decrees  (IG ix.11\u00ad3)  and  externally  in Polyb. 9.39.2  (rC 3l).  The  individual  and  external  use  is attested  in  Delphic  inscriptions  of  C 2  (SGDI 1872.8;  SEG 18 190.5).  In  C 3\u00adC2  some  federal  coins  were  inscribed  , probably  an  abbreviation  of  the  city-ethnic   (Head,  HN \u00b2  339;  SNG  Cop.  Phocis 134). A  bronze  statuette  found  in  a  sanctuary  of  Athena  that was  probably  situated  in  the  territory  of  Antikyra  (Rousset ( 1999)  77  n. 55)  has  a  dedicatory  inscription  which,  accord- ing  to  the  editor,  is  \"Archaic\":  \u00b5'    ' (BCH 89  ( 1955)  257  (C 6\u00adC5?)).  It  is  tempting  to  take the  Diondai  to  be  a  civic  subdivision,  in  which  case  the inscription  is  the  oldest  testimony  we  possess  about Antikyra's  political  institutions. A  defence  circuit  is  attested  for  C 3l  (Livy  26.26.1\u00ad3),  but the  few  uncovered  remains  do  not  allow  of  a  more  precise date  (ArchDelt 37  ( 1982)  205\u00ad6;  Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 76). Pausanias  lists  an  agora,  a  fountain  and  two  gymnasia,  one  of which  is  called  \"ancient\",  but  none  can  be  dated.  Excavations have  revealed  a  sanctuary  of  Athena  of  the  Archaic  and Classical  periods  (BCH 89  ( 1955)  257  (C 6f)).Pausanias  men- tions  other  sanctuaries:  one  of  Poseidon  and,  first of  all,  one of  Artemis  ( 10.37.1),  whose  statue,  by  Praxiteles  or  his  sons, was  reproduced  on  the  C 2  coins  struck  by  the  city  (AM 14 ( 1989)  229\u00ad32;  Lacroix  ( 1949)  309\u00ad10;Head,  HN \u00b2  339). 174.

In  the  accounts  of  the Delphic  naopoioi  the  [Chara]draioi  are  recorded  as  contrib- utors  (CID ii  8.i.5:[ ]  [ ]) in a fragmen- tary  list  whose  lost  heading  undoubtedly  had   \u00b5    vel  sim.

Pausanias  treats  Charadra  as  a polis  once  again  in  connection  with  the  dioikismos  of  the Phokian  cities  in  346  after  the  Third  Sacred  War  ( 10.3.2\u00ad3). Pausanias'  information  is  confirmed b y  the  Delphic accounts  where  the  Charadraioi  are  recorded  among  the Phokian  communities  that  paid  the  annual  fine ( CID ii 108.2  ( 322)).  The  collective  and  external  use  of  the  city-eth- nic  is  attested  in  Delphic  inscriptions  (CID ii  8.i.4,  ii  108.2). The  individual  and  external  use  is  found  in  the  C 3  Delphic proxeny  decree  (BCH 57  ( 1933)  68.2\u00ad3).  The  dioikismos  suf- fered  in  346  and  the  fine paid in  322  show  that  Charadra belonged  to  the  Phokian  koinon. The  identification of  Charadra  with  Mariolata  was  estab- lished  definitively b y  Tillard  ( 1911)  62\u00ad64.  The  site  is  protect- ed  by  an  undated  defence  circuit  in  trapezoidal  and pseudo-isodomic  masonry,  in  some  cases  joggled.  A  diate- ichisma  separated  the  acropolis  to  the  south  from  the  lower town  to  the  north  (Frazer  ( 1898)  416).  The  southern  part  of the  wall  was  enforced  with  at  least  five t owers.  The  northern part  is  too  poorly  preserved  to  estimate  the  area  enclosed  by the  city  wall. 176.

The  urban  sense  is  dominant  at  10.33.1,where Pausanias  reports  that  Ledon  had  once  been  a  polis,  but  that in  his  time  the  few  surviving  Ledontians  had  abandoned their  polis  and  settled  near  the  Kephisos.  Ledon's  fate  in  346 shows  that  it  was  a  member  of  the  Phokian  koinon  (Paus. 10.3.2).  The  absence  of  Ledon  from  Herodotos'  account  at 8.35  has  induced  some  scholars  to  suppose  that  Ledon  may have  been  the  successor  of  one  of  the  settlements  that  disap- pear  in  the  course  of  the  Classical  period,  e.g.  Pedieis  (no. 189)  (Leake  ( 1835)  ii. 89),  but  such  an  assumption  does  not square  with  the  documents  found  later  (Hell.  Oxy.;  CID ii  5; cf.  infra 424). The  location  of  Ledon  cannot  be  established  with  certain- ty.  According  to Paus. 10.33.1,  it  lay  in  the  Kephisos  valley:  a road  leads  from  Tithorea  to  the  ancient  site  of  Ledon,  situat- ed  some  40  stades  from  the  river  Kephisos,  where  the Ledontians  were  settled  in  the  time  of  Pausanias.  In  light  of the  uncertain  nature  of  the  physical  remains,  the  identifica- tion  of  Ledon  with  the  site  of  Gournes  Aghia  Marina (Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 32)  is  questionable.  An  identification with  Modi  remains  more  satisfactory  (Tillard  ( 1911)  map; Klaffenbach  ( 1937);  Kirsten  ( 1951)  716,  741;  Barr.),  although others  have  suggested  an  identification of  Modi  with  Triteis 420 oulhen (no. 196)  (Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 21;  McInerney ( 1999)  281\u00ad83). At  Modi  are  the  remains  of  a  small  fortification ( 100  100 m)  in  isodomic  masonry,  presumably  of  the  Classical  or Hellenistic  period,  whereas  Tillard  ( 1911)  54  suggests 338  as the  terminus  ante  quem.  The  remains  fit L edon  better  than Triteis,  a  polis  that  disappears  completely  from  all  sources after  480  (cf.  no. 196). 185. ", "Drymos": "Identifier: 179. , (Drymios) Map  55.

The  dioikismos  suffered  in  346  shows  that  Drymos belonged  to  the  Phokian  koinon.  The  collective and  internal use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  a  C 2f  agreement  between Drymos  and  the  Oitaian  Federation  (IG ix.1  226.2:   \u00b5).  The  individual  and  external  use  is  attested in  Delphic  inscriptions  (F.Delphes iii.4277.25  (C 2s)). Drymos  was  protected  by  a  large  defence  circuit  of  trian- gular  shape.  Today  its  base  toward  the  south  has  completely disappeared,  but  remains  of  it  were  seen  by  Frazer  ( 1898) 423\u00ad24.  The  western  and  eastern  side  stretched  c. 450  m  and 350  m  respectively,  and  were  equipped  with  towers  at  regular intervals  of  c. 50  m.At  the  northern  end  the  circuit  was  divid- ed  by  two  diateichismata  also  equipped  with  towers.  The whole  fortification was thus subdivided into three sections of  unequal  size.  The  upper  part  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 20  ha (Frazer  ( 1898)  423\u00ad24;  Dassios  ( 1992)  no. 2).

The  city-ethnic  is  (Hdt. 7.156.2;  Philistos  (FGrHist 556)  fr. 5),  which  is  also  qualified in  different  ways  to  distinguish  it  from  the  ethnic  of  Megara Nisaia:    (Hdt 7.156.2;  cf.

It  consisted  of  the  coastal  low- land  on  both  sides  of  the  city  facing  the  bay  of  Augusta  and was  demarcated  by  the  territories  of  Leontinoi  (no. 33)  and Syracuse  (no. 47),  i.e.  by  the  valleys  of  the  river  Porcaria (ancient  Pantakyas)  and  the  river  Anapo  (ancient  Anapos) respectively.  It  measured  c. 400  km \u00b2  (Vallet,  Villard  and Auberson ( 1983)  149\u00ad50;  De  Angelis  ( 1994)  92\u00ad93). According  to  Steph.  Byz. 588.7,  Styella  was  a  phrourion  in  the territory  of  Megara  (cf.  Steph.  Byz. 645.4  citing  Philistos (FGrHist 556)  fr. 20).  Styella  has  been  tentatively  located  on the  western  confines of  Megara's  territory  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea ( 1968)  178\u00ad79).  In  C 7l,  Megara  was  involved  in  war  with  Leontinoi;  it  was  fought  during  the  reign  of Panaitios  of  Leontinoi  (Polyaen. 5.47;  for  the  C 7l  date  of Panaitios:  Luraghi  ( 1994)  11\u00ad14). According  to  Thuc. 6.4.1\u00ad2  Megara  was  founded  by  a colonising  expedition  from  Megara  Nisaia  (no. 225)  led  by Lamis.  The  expedition  at  first settled at T rotilos  on  the  river Pantakyas,  whence  it  moved  on  to  Leontinoi  and  settled ( \u00b5) there with the Chalkidians for a while;  it was,  however,  expelled  ( ) and went on to settle  at Thapsos.  Here  Lamis  died;  the  remnants  of  the  expedition left  Thapsos  and  founded  Megara  (  `)  on land  put  at  their  disposal  by  the  Sikel  king  Hyblon  (for  an analysis  of  the  textual  transmission  of  the  tradition  of  the Sikels  and  the  foundation  of  Megara,  see  Graham  ( 1988)). According  to  Thucydides  the  Megarians  were  driven  out  by Gelon  (in  483)  245  years  after  the  foundation,  giving  a  foun- dation  date  of 728,  thus  later  than  the  foundation  of  Syracuse.  A  different  tradition  was  followed  by  Ephor. fr. 137,  whose  account  is  preserved  in  Strabo  6.2.2  (and Ps.-Skymnos  264\u00ad77).  According  to  this  tradition,  Megara (given  the  initial  name  of ) was founded ten genera- tions  after     by  the  same  expedition,  led  by Theokles  of  Athens,  which  also  founded  Naxos  (no. 41).  The Athenian  origin  here  ascribed  to  Theokles  (who  was  from Euboian  Chalkis  (no. 365))  undoubtedly  reflects later Athenian  claims  to  have  played  a  role  in  the  early  colonial enterprises  in  Sicily  (B\u00e9rard  ( 1957)  78\u00ad79);  Theokles'  expe- dition  included  both  Ionians,  who  founded  Naxos,  and Dorians  (mostly  Megarians),  who  founded  Megara,  and according  to  Ps.-Skymnos  276\u00ad77  this  double  foundation was  the  result  of  stasis  (along  ethnic  lines?)  among  the colonisers.  According  to Strabo  6.2.4,  the  foundations  of Megara,  Naxos  and  Syracuse  were  roughly  contemporary, but  a  group  of  Dorians  who  had  left  the  group  settling  at Megara  were  picked  up  by  Archias  and  joined  his  group  of colonists  in  founding  Syracuse;  so  in  this  tradition  the  foun- dation  of  Megara  preceded  that  of  Syracuse  (ibid.;  cf. Ps.-Skymnos  276\u00ad77).  Archaeological  evidence  has  revealed Greek  presence  at  Megara  from  C 8m  (Villard  and  Vallet ( 1964)  15\u00ad32)  and  therefore  contemporary  with  the  earliest Greek  presence  at  Syracuse  (Pelagatti  ( 1978c)  130\u00ad33);  the sikelia  213 evidence  for  C 8m  Greek  contacts  in  the  hinterland  of Megara  at  Villasmundo  is  not  necessarily  associated  with  the foundation  of  the  colony  (Voza  ( 1973b)). A  C 6m  treaty  of  symmachia  with  Syracuse  is  attested  by Philistos  (FGrHist 556)  fr. 5,  and  Megarian  troops  assisted Syracuse  in  a  war  against  Kamarina.  In  C 5e  Megara  initiated a  war  against  Syracuse  (Hdt. 7.156.2)  but  with  disastrous results:  Megara  was  unable  to  withstand  a  siege  by  Gelon, partly  because  of  stasis  (Polyaen. 1.27.3),  and  c. 483  the  city had  to accept  terms  whereby  the  demos  was  sold  into  slavery whereas  the  pachees  were  relocated  to  Syracuse  and  received citizenship  there  (Hdt. 7.156.2);  Megara  ceased  to  exist  as  a polis,  its  site  lay  abandoned  in  415  (Thuc. 6.49.4),and  the  ter- ritory  was  held  by  Syracuse  (Thuc. 6.94.1).  The  city  must have  been  refounded  by  Timoleon  c. 338;  admittedly,  Megara is  not  specifically mentioned as a T imoleontic  refounda- tion,  but  archaeology  proves  a  refoundation,  which  must  be related  to  Timoleon's  programme  of  refoundations  (Talbert ( 1974)  149). We  know  next  to  nothing  of  the  type  of  constitution  at Megara.  A C 6  stasis  may  be  hypothesised  as  causing  the expulsion  of  citizens  received  as  exiles  at  Selinous  (IvO 22; IGDS  no. 28).  One  Diognetos  was  when  the  city  was attacked  by  Gelon  in  483  (Polyaen. 1.27.3).  The  term \u00b5  in  IvO 22  (C 6l)  refers  to  a  magistracy  attested also  in  Megara  Nisaia  (no. 225)  and  other  Megarian  colonies (cf.  Dubois  on  IGDS  no. 28  fr.b. 5\u00ad6  with  refs.);  however, from  the  context  it  is  not  discernible  whether  the  reference  is to Selinous  (no. 44)  or  to  Megara.  For  the  office in general, see  Asheri  ( 1979b)  490.  IvO 22  mentions  a  halia  ([h ] [];  Arena  ( 1989)  no. 52  fr.  h. 4;  Asheri  ( 1979b)),  but again  it  is  uncertain  whether  the  reference  is  to  Megara  and whether should  be  interpreted  as  an  ekklesia  or  as  a special  court  (Asheri  ( 1979b)  490).  IGDS  no. 20  is  a  lex  sacra of  C 6e. The  evidence  for  cults  is  meagre:  a  dedication  to  heroes theoi  (Arena  ( 1989)  no. 78)  and  an  uncertain  C 3  dedication to  Aphrodite  (Manni  Piraino  ( 1975)  150).  Apart  from  this there  is  the  indirect  evidence  of  a  C 6f  sacrificial law set up b y one  Pasaratos,  or  for  a  local,  otherwise  unknown,  hero Pasaratos  (SEG 26  1084  IGDS  no. 20;  cf.  Sartori  ( 1980\u00ad81) 267).  Cf.  also  Manni  ( 1975)  190\u00ad91  and  Vallet  ( 1991)  515  for numismatic  evidence  of  doubtful  provenance. Megara  was  founded  on  a  flat c oastal  plateau  of  c. 81  ha, previously  uninhabited.  Only  a  small  part  of  the  total  area  of habitation  has  been  investigated.  Soon  after  the  foundation the  urban  area  was  laid  out  with  habitation,  public  spaces and  main  lines  of  communication,  respected  by  the  later  C 7 urban  phase,  when  the  city  was  organised  according  to major  and  minor  transversal  axes  with  insulae  organised  in five districts laid out around a c entral  agora  (Vallet  et al. ( 1976)).  The  five districts may mirror different c ontingents among  the  early  settlers,  reflecting the five  komai  of  the metropolis  Megara  Nisaia  (Strabo  8.6.22;  cf.  Vallet  et al. ( 1983)  145\u00ad46);  or  they  may  simply  be  the  successors  of  early scattered  habitation  areas,  each  with  public  spaces  and  sanc- tuaries  (Polignac  ( 1999)  227),  superseded  in  C 7l  by  a  cen- tralised  urban  layout  implying  standardised  modules  for  the habitation  lots  (Tr\u00e9ziny  ( 1999)).  The  earliest  habitation remains  are  C 8l  houses  of  a  type  known  also  at  Syracuse  and Naxos.  Yet  a  habitation  area  has  been  investigated  on  the southern  plateau,  c. 500  m  south  of  the  main  urban  area. Remains  of  a  gate  and  a  C 7m  double-faced  circuit  wall  in rough  stones  with  internal  fill,  strengthened  on  the  outside by  a  trench,  have  been  laid  bare.  C 8  habitation,  a  C 7  potters' workshop  and  a  sanctuary  of  C 7f\u00adC6  reveal  the  impressive extent  of  the  early  colony:  a  settlement  measuring  c. 60  ha (Broise  et al.( 1983);  Gras  ( 1984\u00ad85);  Tr\u00e9ziny  ( 1999)  176\u00ad79). On  the  assumption  that  about  half  of  this  area  was urbanised,  the  C 7  population  has  been  estimated  at  c. 2,000 (De  Angelis  ( 1994)  97\u00ad99),  probably  a  much  too  pessimistic assessment  (Hansen  ( 1997b)  74  n. 153).  The  C 7m  circuit  wall was  replaced  in  C 6s  by  a  well-built  ashlar  wall,  of  which  a stretch  is  preserved  on  the  northern  side  of  the  city  and landwards  by  stretches  of  a  long  curving  wall,  in  all  c. 1,500 m,  with  semicircular  towers  on  the  outside  (Vallet  et al. ( 1983)  97\u00ad101). The  C 6  building  near  the  agora,  unconvincingly  identi- fied as a prytaneion  (Vallet  et al.( 1983)  62\u00ad69;  cf.  S.  G.  Miller ( 1978)  229\u00ad30),  is  undoubtedly  a  public  structure;  another monumental  structure  from  c. 640  on  the  south  side  of  the agora  is  also  furnished  with  banquet  rooms  and  may  have had  a  public  function  (Vallet  et al.( 1983)  77\u00ad81;  Kiderlen ( 1995)  14\u00ad17,  215).  C 7s  stoas  lined  the  agora  on  its  north  and east  sides. A  number  of  sacred  buildings  were  located  adjacent  to,  or in  the  vicinity  of,  the  agora:  a  two-cella  heroon  facing  the agora  may  have  housed  a  cult  of  the  oecist  Lamis  (Vallet  et al. ( 1976)  209\u00ad11,(1983)  62).  Two  C 7s  naiskoi,  one  with  an  inter- nal  row  of  columns  but  both  without  peristasis,  delimited the  agora  on  its  south  side  (Vallet  et al.( 1983)  48\u00ad49,  69\u00ad70); small  single-cella  temples,  naiskoi,  are known from  various locations  in  the  vicinity  of  the  agora  (Vallet  et al.( 1983)  44, 62;  Polignac  ( 1999)  215).  The  C 6e  Doric  temple  located  on the  central  part  of  the  plateau  (Orsi  ( 1921)  153\u00ad76;  Villard and  Vallet  ( 1954)  13\u00ad24)  and  C 6  temples  on  the  sea  front 214 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo reveal  a  belt  of  sanctuaries  encircling  the  habitation  area (Polignac  ( 1999)  216\u00ad20;  for  sanctuaries  and  cults,  see  also Hinz  ( 1998)  141\u00ad43).  The  Timoleontic  foundation  occupied primarily  the  north-eastern  corner  of  the  Archaic  city  and was  later  restricted  to  an  area  of 12  ha  by  the  C 3l  fortification erected  before  the  final destruction of  the  city  by  Marcellus in 213  (Livy  24.34.2).  Timoleon's  city  followed,  with  modifi- cations,  the  layout  of  the  Archaic  city,  the  agora  was  re- established,  and  sanctuaries  and  a  stoa  were  erected  in  the vicinity  (Vallet  et al.( 1983)  168\u00ad74). The  Archaic  cemeteries  were  located  to  the  north,  west and  south  of  the  city:  the  graves  are  mainly  of  C 7\u00adC6  with very few  C 8  graves.  A  social  elite  is  indicated  by  rich,  monu- mental  cella  tombs  (Shepherd  ( 1995)  56\u00ad60  with  refs.),  and social  differentiation  is  also  attested  by  Herodotos'  distinc- tion  between  the  demos  and  hoi  pachees  ( 7.156.2). Megara  did  not  issue  coins  during  its  Archaic  existence, and  the  attribution  of  a  silver  litra  inscribed  to  the Timoleontic  refoundation  (Head,  HN \u00b2151)  is  far  from  universally  accepted  (Vallet  ( 1991)  515  with  refs.). Megara  was  the  metropolis  of  Selinous  (no. 44),  founded in 649  according  to Diod. 13.59.4,  or  in 628  according  to Thuc. 6.4.2. Messana  (Messanios) See  below  51.Zankle. 37.  Morgantina  (Morgantinos) Map  47.  Lat. 37.25,long. 14.30.  Size  of  territory:  ?  Type:  C: .  The  toponym  is  ,  (Thuc. 4.65.1;  36.5.7); ,  (C 5m coins,  infra;Diod. 11.78.5);  or  (Diod. 14.78.7); Strabo  6.1.6  has ,  .  The  city-ethnic  is (C 4s  coins,  infra). Morgantina  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Diod. 11.78.5  (r 459),  where  the  political  sense  may  be  a  connota- tion.  The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found on  C 4  coins. Most  scholars  have  identified M organtina  with  the Archaic,  Classical  and  Hellenistic  town  investigated  on  the c. 3  km-long  Serra  Orlando  ridge,  near  Aidone  (an  identifi- cation  based  mainly  upon  numismatic  evidence:  Dubois, IDGS  pp. 226\u00ad27).  The  Classical  and  Hellenistic  city  occu- pied  the  lower  ridge,  whereas  the  Archaic  town  was  situated on  the  Cittadella  hill  which  rises  to  the  east,  and  which,  in itself,  consists  of  an  upper  acropolis  and  two  lower  plateaux. Morgantina  was  originally  a  non-Greek  community (Tsakirgis  ( 1995)  125;  Antonaccio  ( 1997)  168\u00ad70),  and  at Diod. 14.78.7  (r 396)  it  is  implicitly  described  as  Sikel.  The Archaic  settlement  of  Morgantina  has  revealed  Greek  con- tacts  primarily  from  the  mid-sixth  century.  The  Cittadella and  adjacent  areas  have  yielded  valuable  evidence  of  sanctu- aries  and  naiskoi  of  Greek  type.  Foundations  of  a  mid-sixth- century  hekatompedon  have  been  excavated  on  the  upper plateau  and  a  rich  harvest  of  architectural  terracottas  found on  the  lower  plateaux  are  evidence  of  a  naiskos  in  this  part  of  the  Archaic  settlement  too  (Barletta  ( 1983)  49\u00ad67; Antonaccio  ( 1997)).  A  fortification wall was added t o  the already  considerable  natural  defences  of  the  site  in  C 5e,  pos- sibly  in  response  to  the  expedition  of  Hippokrates  of  Gela (Sj\u00f6quist  ( 1973)  45\u00ad46;  cf.  Hdt. 7.154). The  cemeteries,  situated  on  the  slopes  of  the  Cittadella hill,  have  revealed  clear  evidence  of  Greek  contacts  and acculturation  from  the  Archaic  period  (Lyons  ( 1996)). However,  tomb  typology  suggests  continuity  of  Sikel  culture,  albeit  with  some  Hellenisation  of  tomb  architecture and  typology,  and  Archaic  Morgantina  may  not  have  been  a mono-ethnic  community  (Lyons  ( 1996);  see  also Antonaccio  ( 1997)).  Architectural  terracottas  and  other remains  of  buildings  attest  to  important  C 6m\u00adC6l  religious structures,  some  in  Greek  style  (Barletta  ( 1983)  49\u00ad67;for sanctuaries,  see  Hinz  ( 1998)  124\u00ad34).A  survey  of  the  archae- ological  evidence,  with  bibliography,  is  found  in  Tsakirgis ( 1995);  cf.  also  Antonaccio  ( 1997).  By  c. 460,  Greek-style coinage  was  introduced  with  types  that  attest  to  Greek  cults (infra).  Moreover,  a kylix  of  c. 460  carries  an  inscription (SEG 38  949)  indicating  the  existence  of  Greek-style  civic subdivisions  (eikades). The  C 5e  destruction  phase  of  Morgantina  is  most  often linked  to  the  activities  of  Hippokrates  of  Gela  in  north- eastern  Sicily.  When  captured  and  refounded  by  Douketios in 459/8,  it  became  an  axiologos  polis  according  to Diod. 11.78.5.  The  new  settlement  on  Serra  Orlando  was  a  city founded  according  to  Greek  customs:  a  formal  urban  layout with  plateiai  and  stenopoi  has  its  origin  in  this  period, though  the  rich evidence  for  public  buildings  dates  primari- ly  to the  Hellenistic  period  (Bell  ( 1988)  314\u00ad16;  Tsakirgis ( 1995)  126\u00ad27).  The  acts  of  foundation  and  the  terminology employed  by  Diodorus  in  connection  with  Douketios'foun- dations  in  the  period  459\u00ad458  are  similar  to  those  known from  Greek  colonial  foundations:  the  presence  of  an  oikistes, the  planning  of  an  urban  centre,  and  the  division  of  the chora  into  lots  (cf.  Rizzo  ( 1970)  58\u00ad66;  Bell  ( 1984\u00ad85)  505\u00ad6; ( 1988)  320\u00ad21). The  peace  concluded  between  the  Sicilian  cities  at  the Congress  of  Gela  in  424  implies  that  Morgantina  had  been within  the  sphere  of  influence of  Syracuse  prior  to 424 (Thuc. 4.65.1);  but  by  the  Peace,  Syracuse  (no. 44)  handed over  Morgantina  to  Kamarina  (no. 28)  in  return  for  a  speci- sikelia  215 fied payment (  ).Morgantina is next listed among  the  cities  taken  by Dionysios  I  during  his  campaign against  the  Sikels  in  396  (Diod. 14.78.7),  and  later  the  city  is mentioned  in  connection  with  the  war  between  Magon  and Dionysios  I  (Diod. 14.95.2). Morgantina  issued  an  unusually  rich  coinage  which  has been  divided  into  the  following  main  groups  by  Erim  (in Buttrey et al.( 1989)  3\u00ad67):  ( 1)  silver  litrai  from  c. 465\u00ad450,sty- listically  related  to  contemporary  litrai  of  Gela:  obv.  bearded head  wearing  taenia  (an  unidentified local divinity);  rev.  ear  of grain,  legend: (retrograde,  gamma  and rho  written  in  early  forms);  ( 2)  c. 370\u00ad350:  tetradrachms  of Syracusan  type  with  legend  in  exergue on  rev.,  known  in  two  specimens  only;  ( 3)  silver  litrai,  three issues, 344\u00ad317:(a)  1\u0152  litra:  obv.  head  of  Athena  in  triple-crest- ed  helmet,  en face,  legend: ;  rev.  Nike seated  on  rock  (rev.  type  reveals  stylistic  affinities w ith  coins  of Terina),  legend  as  on  obv.:  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 471);  (b)  litra:  obv. female  head  in  profile (Persephone or A rtemis,  or  long-haired Apollo?),  legend: ;  rev.  horseman  in chlamys  thrusting  spear  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 472);  (c)  a  rare  issue known  from  two  specimens,  a  variant  of  ( 3a)  above;  ( 4) bronze  coinage, 330\u00ad317:(a)  obv.  head  of  Athena  in  Attic  hel- met,  legend: ;rev.lion devouring head of stag  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 473\u00ad74);  (b)  obv.  head  of  Sikelia(?)  or male  divinity;  rev.  eagle  standing  on  snake,  legend: , (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 475);  (c)  obv.  head  of  Apollo(?), legend: ;  rev.  tripod,  legend: .  The  latter issues  are  probably  Timoleontic  (Erim  in  Buttrey  et  al.

The  toponym  is  , (Hecat.  fr. 73;  Thuc. 6.51.3;C5f  coins,  infra)  or  (IG iv\u00b2.195.ii.71  ( 356/5)).  The  city-ethnic  is  (Thuc. 7.57.11;C5m  coins;  IG ii\u00b2  162  (C 4f)). Katane  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Hecat.  fr. 73  and Thuc. 6.51.1\u00ad2,  and  in  the  political  sense  at  Thuc. 7.14.2  and  in Arist.  Pol. 1274a24,  a  passage  which  also  refers  to  the  . It is  called  patris  by Diod. 11.49.2  (r 476)  and  11.76.3  (r 461). The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on C 5m  coins  (infra),  and  the  external  use  in  Thuc. 6.3.3  and  IG i\u00b3  291.b.ii.15  ( 415);  the  external  individual  use  is  attested  by Arist.  Pol. 1274a23  (rC 6s)  and  IG ii\u00b2  162  (C 4f). The  territory  is  termed  at  Thuc. 3.116.1  and  chora  by Diod. 11.49.1  (r 476),who  names  it  (ibid.).  It  com- prised  parts  of  the  fertile  plains  delimited  inland  by  Etna and  the  Monti  Siracusani  with  the  Sikel  settlements  of  Hybla Geleatis,  Inessa,  Kentoripa  (no. 31)  and  Piakos  (no. 43; Manganaro  ( 1996a)  26),  in  all  about  400  km \u00b2.However, Leontinoi  (no. 33),  the  earlier  foundation,  may  have  domi- nated  part  of  this  area,  leaving  a  more  limited  area  for  the direct  use  of  Katane.  Chalkidian  expansion  far  inland  to  the  south-west  of  Katane  and  Leontinoi  is  revealed  by  the Chalkidian  legal  texts  found  at  the  settlement  of  Monte  San Mauro  (Frasca  ( 1997)).  The  C 6m  indigenous  centres  show  a notable  degree  of  Hellenisation,  probably  evidence  of  a Chalkidian  dominion  comprising  also  the  lowland  plains  of the  rivers  Simeto,  Dittaino  (for  a  phrourion  at  M.  Turcisi,  cf. Procelli  ( 1988\u00ad89))  and  Trigonia.  The  chora  of  Katane  was bounded  to  the  south  by  the  territory  of  Leontinoi  (cf.  Thuc. 6.65.1)  and  to  the  north  by  that  of  Naxos  (no. 41;Procelli ( 1989)  684\u00ad89;  Manganaro  ( 1996a)  25,29).The  territory  suf- fered  from  an  eruption  of  Etna  in  426/5  (Thuc. 3.116),  and  in 415/14  it  was  ravaged  by  Syracusan  forces  (Thuc. 6.75.2). Katane  was  founded  by  \"Thoukles  and  the  Chalkidians from  Naxos\"  (Thuc. 6.3.2;  cf.  Hellan.  fr. 82),  after  these  had founded  Leontinoi  in  the  fifth y ear  after  the  foundation  of Syracuse  (i.e. 729:  Thuc. 6.3.2).  According  to  Thuc. 6.3.3,  the Katanaians  \"themselves  made  Euarchos  their  oecist\" (Leschhorn  ( 1984)  11\u00ad13),  implying  that  the  city  obtained autonomous  status  soon  after  its  foundation.  Thuc. 6.3.3  possibly  implies  that  the  Greeks  drove  out  the  Sikel population,  and  there  is  tenuous  archaeological  evidence supporting  this  (Procelli  ( 1992)). In 476,  Hieron  transferred  the  populations  of  Katane  and Naxos  to  Leontinoi,  renamed  Katane  as  Aitna  and  settled  it with 10,000  oiketores: 5,000  from  the  Peloponnese  and  5,000 from  Syracuse  (Diod. 11.49.2);  though  the  report  on  the  relocation  of  populations  refers  to  both  Katane  and  Naxos, Katane  seems  to  have  been  the  site  refounded  as  Aitna  (no. 8.I):   \u00b5  \u00b5\u00b5 ,    \u00b5         \u00b5  ,  \u00b5  .  (Cf.  Strabo  6.2.3,  who  focuses  exclusively  on Katane  in  his  report  on  the  foundation  of  Aitna.)  After Hieron  had  died  in  466,  the  Katanaians  returned  in  461  and expelled  the  Aitnaians  (Strabo  6.2.3),  according  to Diod. 11.76.3  after  several  battles  (  \u00b5) between the Hieronian  settlers  and  Syracuse  as  well  as  the  Sikels  under Douketios.  Cf.  further  Aitna  (no. 8.I).  In  403  Dionysios  I  was able  to  take  possession  of  Katane  through  the  betrayal  of  the city  by  the  strategos  Arkesilaos:  the  inhabitants  were  sold  into slavery  and  the  city  granted  to  Campanians  (Diod. 14.15.1\u00ad3), who  in  their  turn  were  transplanted  to  Aitna  in  396.After  that date  the  demographic  history  of  the  city  becomes  obscure:  it is  mentioned  again  in  353  when  it  was  taken  by  Kallippos, Dion's  murderer  (Plut.  Dio 58.4).  In  394,  the  surviving Katanaians  were  settled  by  Rhegion  (no. 68)  in  Mylai  (Diod. 14.87.1),  but  presumably  had  to scatter  across  the  island  when Mylai  fell  to  Dionysios  later  that  year  (Diod. 14.87.3). Katane  was  presumably  among  the  Chalkidikai  poleis allied  with  Leontinoi  (no. 33)  in  its  war  with  Syracuse  (no. 47)  in  427  and  may,  with  its  ally,  have  sent  an  embassy  to Athens  asking  for  help  in  427  (Thuc. 3.86.2\u00ad3;  cf.  Andoc. 3.30 with  Albini  ( 1964)  100).  Nikias'  letter  at  Thuc. 7.14.2  men- tions  Katane  as  an  ally  ( \u00b5\u00b5)  of  Athens  (no. 361)  in 414/13  (though  Diod. 13.4.2  reports  that  it  was  originally  in favour  of  Syracuse);  the  treaty  was  concluded  (  ... \u00b5\u00b5   ) in 415  at  an  assembly ( ) attended by Athenian strategoi  and  against  the wishes  of  a  pro-Syracusan  faction  (Thuc. 6.50.3\u00ad51.2).Cf.IG i\u00b3  291.b.ii.15  ( 415):  a  payment  by  Katane  to  Athens. IG ii\u00b2  162  is  a  C 4f  grant  of  Athenian  proxeny  to two  men  of Katane.  A  citizen  of  Katane  served  as  theorodokos  of Epidauros  (no. 348)  in  356/5  (IG iv\u00b2.195.ii.71;  cf.  Manganaro ( 1996a)  46  n. 81). There  is  no  evidence  for  Archaic  or  C 5  tyranny  at  Katane. According  to  Arist.  Pol. 1274a23,  Charondas  of  Katane  206 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo legislated  for  his  own  city  as  well  as  for  other  Chalkidian cities.  An  ekklesia  is  attested  for  415  (Thuc. 6.51.2)  and  a  strat- egos  is  mentioned  at  Diod. 14.15.1  (r 403).  In  344,  the  city  was ruled  by  the  tyrant  Mamerkos/Markos,  who  initially  sided with  Timoleon  (Diod. 16.69.4)  but  then  joined  Carthage only  to be  betrayed  by     who  handed  Katane over  to Timoleon  (Plut.  Tim. 34). The  urban  layout  at  Katane  is  virtually  unknown.  The  ini- tial  settlement  occupied  the  acropolis  above  the  coastal  plain and  harbour,  today  occupied  by  Piazza  Dante  and  the Convento  dei  Benedettini;  structural  remains  from  this  peri- od  are  scarce,  but  Protocorinthian  material  confirms a C 8s Greek  presence  (Rizza  ( 1980\u00ad81)  769,  pl. 186.1\u00ad2,(1981)  316, figs. 4\u00ad6),  and  there  are  remains  of  C 6  habitation  structures (Giudice  et al.( 1979)  139\u00ad40).  Traces  of  C 8  habitation  have been  revealed  below  the  acropolis  near  the  ancient  coastline (A.  Patan\u00e8  ( 1993\u00ad94)  907),  and  the  size  and  location  of  the ancient  harbour  are  reviewed  by  Lagona  ( 1996).  In the  later Classical  period  the  habitation  area  incorporated  also  the lower  plateau,  probably  with  an  agora  located  on  the  site  of the  later  Roman  forum  close  to  the  theatre  and  odeion.The theatre where  the  ekklesia  met  in  415  (Frontin.  Str. 3.2.6)  was located  on  the  southern  slopes  of  the  plateau.  Remains  date mainly  from  the  Roman  period,  but  its  size  (seating  capacity c. 7,000)  may  reflect that of  the  Greek  theatre  (Mitens  ( 1988) 100\u00ad3;  TGR  ii. 428\u00ad30,C5?).  The  few  Greek  remains  are  from C 5  (Anti  ( 1947)  125,  128;  Bacci  ( 1980\u00ad81a)).  The  adjacent Roman  odeion  may  also  have  had  a  Greek  predecessor,  possi- bly  a  bouleuterion  (proximity  of  theatre and  bouleuterion  is known  from  other  sites;  cf.  Kolb  ( 1981)  88). On  the  southern  slope  of  the  acropolis  a  rich  C 6\u00adC4 votive  deposit  has  revealed  a  sanctuary.  The  cult  of  the  early phase  may  have  been  that  of  Hera,  although  the  evidence  is tenuous.  The  votive  terracottas  show  that  from  C 5  the  cult was  that  of  Demeter  and  Kore,  with  whom  Hieron,  as  a Deinomenid,  had  special  bonds  (Rizza  ( 1960),  ( 1996)  12\u00ad13, pl. 1;  Hinz  ( 1998)  161\u00ad63). The  central  area  of  the  Roman  city  may  suggest  the approximate  extent  of  the  Greek  city.  To  the  west  this  was delimited  by  the  acropolis,  to  the  north  by  the  C 6l\u00adC5e cemetery  (Orsi  ( 1918)),  to  the  north-east  by  the  river Amenanos,  and  to  the  south-east  by  the  sea,  in  all  occupying an  area  of 75\u00ad100  ha  (cf.  Rizza  ( 1996)  11\u00ad12).  According  to Thuc. 6.51.1  (r 415),  the  city  had  a  circuit  wall,  destroyed  in 403  by  Dionysios  (Diod. 14.15.2\u00ad3). Katane  began  striking  coins  rather  late  compared  with other  Sicilian  poleis,  perhaps  due  to  political  or  economic dependence  on  Naxos  (Manganaro  ( 1996a)  29):  minting started  c. 461  on  the  Attic  standard  (with  denominations based  on  the  tetradrachm)  at  the  time  of  the  return  of  the former  inhabitants  relocated  by  Hieron  to  Leontinoi  (for  a survey  of  the  coinage,  see  Manganaro  ( 1996b)).  The  types are  obv.  man-headed  river-god  Amenanos  crowned  by  a  fly- ing  Nike;  rev.  Nike  running  and  holding  a  wreath  or  fillet, legends: ,  or,  more  rarely, (Manganaro  ( 1996b)  307\u00ad8;  SNG  Cop. Sicily 174\u00ad75).  These  issues  are  sometimes  thought  to  pre- date  476  (Head,  HN \u00b2130,  followed  by  Marotta  D'Agata  et al. ( 1987)  156),  but  there  is  greater  consensus  for  dating  them  as an  inauguration  issue,  to  461  (Stazio  ( 1978)  191,  194; Manganaro  ( 1996b)  305).  After  C 5m  the  obv.type of the  tetradrachms,  a  quadriga,  reveals  the  influence of Leontinian  and  Syracusan  issues;  rev.  head  of  Apollo,  leg- end: ,  from  C 5l  (Manganaro  ( 1996b)  309;  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 176\u00ad79).  From c. 402  tetradrachms  were  signed  by  the  engravers Herakleides  and  Euainetos:  obv.  Apollo  en face;  rev.quadri- ga,  legend: (Manganaro  ( 1996b)  309\u00ad10; SNG  Cop.  Sicily 180).  Varied  issues  of  lower  denominations c. 450\u00ad402  are  based  upon  drachms  and  fractions  (types: quadriga,  head  of  Amenanos,  Silenos,  bull)  and  upon  the litrai  and  fractions  (types:  Silenos,  stylised  thunderbolt)  (C. Boehringer  ( 1982);  Manganaro  ( 1996b)  308,  310\u00ad11;  SNG Cop.  Sicily 181\u00ad84)).  The  earliest  bronze  coinage  is  dated c. 405  (Manganaro  ( 1996b)  311);  coins  with  rev.  butting  bull were  probably  minted  by Mamerkos  and  the  Campanian mercenaries  settled  at  Katane  by  Dionysios  between  403  and 396  (Manganaro  ( 1996b)  312\u00ad13;  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 184). Timoleontic  issues  follow  in  C 4m:  obv.  head  of  nymph;  rev. man-headed  bull,  Amenanos  (Manganaro  ( 1996b)  313). A  group  of  C 5l  hemidrachms,  obv.  head  of  Apollo,  legend: ;  rev.  butting  bull,  legend: ,may be evidence  of  collaboration  between  Leontinoi  and  Katane  in the  face  of  Syracusan  pressure  in  404\u00ad403  (Manganaro ( 1996b)  311\u00ad12;  C.  Boehringer  ( 1998)  51),  or--perhaps rather--it may be an issue of  the  Campanian  mercenaries settled  in  Katane  by  Dionysios  I  in  403;  in  that  case  the  leg- end may  attest  to  Leontinian  dependence  upon Katane  (Kraay  ( 1976)  229;Corretti et al.( 1990)  532). 31.

Politai  is  found in  Porph.  De  vita  Pythag. 21  (rC 6l)  (  Aristox.  fr. 17,Wehrli). The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on  C 4 coins  (infra),  and  the  external  collective  use  in  Thuc. 7.32.1, Porph.  De  vita  Pythag. 21  (rC 6l)  (  Aristox.  fr. 17,  Wehrli) and  Diod. 13.84.4  (rC 5l). Thuc. 6.94.3  describes  Kentoripa  as  a  Sikel  community; and  it  is  implicitly  described  as  Sikel  at  Diod. 14.78.7  (r 396). A  claim  or  pretension  to  Greek  identity  may  be  implied  by the  Greek  names  of  its  Classical  rulers  (Damon,  Nikodemos; infra)  and  Greek-style  coins  were  issued  by  the  Timoleontic refoundation  (infra). At 6.94.3,  Thucydides  relates  how  in  414  the  Athenians won  over  Kentoripa  by homologia,  and  at  7.32.1  the Kentoripes  are  described  as  Athenian  symmachoi  in 413.In 396,  Damon,  the  ruler  of  Kentoripa,  made  a  syntheke  with Dionysios  I  (Diod. 14.78.7);  this  Damon  may  possibly  have been  appointed  proxenos  by  Athens  (no. 361)  (IG ii\u00b2  32 ( 385/4)).  Reception  of  a  presbeia  from  Akragas  (no. 9)  is attested  at  Diod. 13.83.4  (rC 5l).  A  meeting  of  the  ekklesia  is attested  by Diod. 13.83.4  (rC 5l). Porph.  De  vita  Pythag. 21  (rC 6l)  (  Aristox.  fr. 17,  Wehrli) refers  to  a  tyrant  by  the  name  of  Simichos  who  renounced  his rule  upon  becoming  a  Pythagorean.  At  Diod. 14.78.7  (r 396)  a Damon  is  described  as   ,  and  at 16.82.4  (r 339),  a  Nikodemos  is  described  as   and  is  said  to  have  been  ousted  from  his  city  by Timoleon,  who  gave  Syracusan  citizenship  to  its  freed  inhab- itants  (ibid.).  The  phrase  used  by  Diodorus,  ,  suggests  to Moggi,  Sin. 357  that  the  inhabitants, along  with  those  of  Agyrion  (no. 7),  were transferred  to Syracuse;  Agyrion  was  later  assigned  new  citizens  (Diod. 16.82.5),  and  so  presumably  was  Kentoripa,  although  this  is not  explicitly  stated.  A  Timoleontic  refoundation  is,  howev- er,  reflected in the striking of  a  new  coinage  (infra)  and  in craft  production  of  Greek  type  (R.  P.  A.  Patan\u00e8  ( 1992)  69,  73). The  archaeological  evidence  from  the  city's  Hellenised phase  is  mainly  C 4s  and  Hellenistic,  but  urban  remains  are few  (Marotta  D'Agata  and  Rizza  ( 1987)  esp. 236\u00ad38; R.  Patan\u00e8  ( 1988)). Bronze  litrai  were struck  briefly under T imoleon  after  the ousting  of  Nikodemos  in  339/8  (cf.  R.  P.  A.  Patan\u00e8  ( 1992)  69): obv.  head  of  Kore  surrounded  by  dolphins  (so-called Euainetos  type,  taken  over  from  Syracuse);  rev.  leopard, legend: (Head,  HN \u00b2135;  SNG  Cop.

Hippana  is  commonly  identified w ith  the  site  of  Monte dei  Cavalli  in  the  territory of  Himera,  but  the  evidence  for this  identification is not c onclusive.  The  urban  remains  are mainly  from  a  C 4m\u00adC3m  phase,  which  is  interpreted  as  a Timoleontic  refoundation  of  the  originally  indigenous  set- tlement.  Strongly  built  circuit  walls  in  ashlar  were  raised  on an  acropolis  and  around  the  lower  habitation  plateau, 30  ha in  area.  There  are  some  remains  of  public  structures,  a shrine  and  a  theatre  of  Greek  type.  Aerial  photography  has revealed  formal  planning  on  the  lower  plateau:  Mitens ( 1988)  104;  Michelini  ( 1992);  Vassallo  ( 1991).

Pelagatti ( 1964\u00ad65)  252  suggests  a  location  at  Mendolito  on  the  basis of  a  Sikulan  inscription  iamakaram(?)  found  there.  Type: C: . The  toponym  * '\u00b5  is  suggested  by  the  city-ethnic (infra);  Ptol.  Geog. 3.4.7  lists `\u00b5  '\u00b5  among the  poleis  mesogeioi  tes  Sikelias.  The  city-ethnic  is '\u00b5  (IGDS  no. 199  (C 5);  C 4  coins,  infra). No  source  calls  Imachara  a  polis,  but  it  is  included here  on  account  of  ( 1)  its  C 5  kerykeion  (supra;  for  a  full discussion  of  this  type  of  evidence  from  Sicily,  see Manganaro  ( 1996c)  141\u00ad44;(1997)),  and  ( 2)  its  C 4  coins. Both  of  these  attest  the  internal  collective  use  of  the  city- ethnic,  indicate  a  high  degree  of  Hellenisation,  and  suggest polis  status. sikelia  201 The  mint  of  Imachara  is  known  from  two  specimens  only, both  silver  litrai:  obv.  head  of  Hera,  legend: ; rev.  butting  bull  (Jenkins  ( 1975)  90\u00ad92). 27.

The  toponym  is  , (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iv.93  ( 230\u00ad210);  Strabo  6.2.1),  or   (Ptol.  Geog. 3.4.2).  The  city-ethnic  is  (IGUR ii 823  (Hell.);  Diod. 13.69.3)  or  (Diod. 23.5 (r 263/2)). Tyndaris  is  called  a  polis  in  connection  with  its  founda- tion  in  396  in  Diod. 14.78.5,a  passage  which  presumably  uses polis  primarily  in  the  urban  sense  although  the  presence  of the  terms  and indicates that  the  term  may  carry  the  political  sense  as  well  (cf. Hansen  ( 2000)  175\u00ad76).According  to  the  text,  the  commun- ity     quickly  grew  to number more  than  5,000:  this  implies  grants  of  citizenship  and  reg- istration  of  citizens,  and  thus  shows  that  Tyndaris  was  a polis;  the  city  furthermore  struck  coins  in  C 4m  (infra),  con- cluded  a  treaty  of  symmachia  with  Timoleon  (Diod. 16.69.3, a  passage  which  also  mentions  armed  forces  of  the  city)  and had  a  Delphic  theorodokos  in  C 3s  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iv.93 ( 230\u00ad210)).  The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is found  on  C 4m  coins  (infra);  the  external  collective use  is found  in  Diod. 16.69.3  (r 344);  and  the  external  individual use  is  found  in  IGUR ii  823  (Hell.). Tyndaris  was  founded  as  a  fortress  by  Dionysios  I  in  396 (Diod. 14.78.5;  cf.  Consolo  Langher  ( 1996b))  on  the  coast c. 60  km  west  of  Messana  (no. 51).The  city  was  populated  with 600  Peloponnesian  Messenians  expelled  from  Zakynthos (no. 141)  and  Naupaktos  (no. 165;  Asheri  ( 1983)).  Territory for the  new  community  was  taken  from  that  of  the  city  of Abakainon  (no. 5;Diod.  14.78.5),  and  the  defeat  of  Magon  at Abakainon  by  Dionysios  finally secured the t erritory  of Tyndaris  (Diod. 14.90.4).  The  Messenians  named  their  city 232 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo Tyndaris  after  the  cult  of  the  Tyndaridai.  By  admission  of  new settlers  shortly  after  the  foundation  the  population  of Tyndaris  grew  to  more  than  5,000  (Diod. 14.78.6). The  territory  bordered  inland  upon  that  of  Abakainon;  to the  east  it  was  delimited  by  the  territory  of  Mylai,  and  fur- ther  inland  by  the  Sikel  site  of  Longane.  The  territory  may have  comprised  some  hundreds  of  km \u00b2,  but  that  is  difficult to  ascertain.  A  close  relationship  with  the  neighbouring  site of  Agathyrnon  is  suggested  by C 4l  (C 3  according  to  Consolo Langher  ( 1965))  bronze  coinage  with  types  obv.  head  of Apollo,  legend: ;  rev.  armed  warrior,  legend: (the  eponym  of  Agathyrnon;  cf.  Diod. 5.8.2);  however,  the  coins  may  be  a  reference  to  annexation of  Agathyrnian  territory  by  Tyndaris,  rather  than  testimony of  an  alliance  (Consolo  Langher  ( 1965)  82  n. 66;Lacroix ( 1965)  46\u00ad47). The  city  was  built  in  a  strong  military  position  on  the  top of  a  rocky  promontory  with  precipitous  cliffs  facing  sea- wards  and  with  access  only  from  the  east.  The  town  was located  on  a  narrow  plateau  with  three  plateiai  oriented north-east\u00adsouth-west  laid  out  on  three  levels  along  the length  of  the  plateau,  orthogonally  crossed  by stenopoi.The size  of  the  city  was  about  14  ha.  The  extant  remains  are Roman,  but  there  are  traces  of  a  Timoleontic  C 4m  phase, and  the  origin  of  the  town plan  probably  goes  back  to the time  of  its  foundation  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea  and  Cavalier  ( 1965)).A circuit  wall  was  erected  inland  along  the  south-east  and south-west  sides  of  the  city.  The  first wall,  going  back  to  the Dionysian  foundation,  was  built  in  rough  stones  faced  with plaster  and  strengthened  at  intervals  with  pilasters  built  in ashlar.  In  C 3e(?)  the  wall  was  replaced  by  a  4.5  m-wide  dou- ble  curtain-wall  built  in  ashlar  with  internal  fill strength- ened  with  a  number  of  square  towers  and  a  deep pincer-shaped  gate  (S\u00e4flund ( 1937)  412\u00ad17;  Barreca  ( 1959)). A  stretch  of  the  wall  descending  obliquely  north-west  pro- tected  access  to the  harbour  below  the  city  (Barreca  ( 1957)). An  agora  was  probably  located  on  the  south-east  side  of the  habitation  area  in  the  region  of  the  later  Roman  forum. No  buildings  of  the  Greek  phase  are  extant,  but  near  the forum  a  theatre  with  its  back  to  the  circuit  wall  and  facing  the upper,  principal  plateia  has  a  Greek  phase  dating  to  c. 300; the  koilon  had  a  diameter  of 76  m  and  a  seating  capacity  of c. 3,000  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea  ( 1964\u00ad65)). A  cult  of  the  Dioskouroi,  the  Tyndaridai,  is  not  explicitly attested,  but  coin  types  give  clear  evidence  that  such  a  cult was  of  major  importance  (Ziegler  ( 1943)  1785;  Consolo Langher  ( 1965)  66).  A  second,  Timoleontic,  series  of  coins have  as  type  a  head  of  Apollo  (Consolo  Langher  ( 1965)  81).A Zeus  cult  is  attested  by  C 3  bronze  coin  types  depicting  a  stat- ue  of  Zeus,  possibly  the  Messenian  Zeus  Ithomatas  (Ziegler ( 1943)  1785).  Athena,  Poseidon,  Dionysos  and  Kore(?)  are shown on  C 3  coin  types  (ibid.),  and  Artemis  Eupraxia  on  a C 2  dedicatory  relief  (Fischer-Hansen  ( 1992)  no. 12). Tyndaris  struck  bronze  coins  in  C 4m,  consisting  of  hemil- itra  with  fractions,  trias  and  uncia:  pre-Timoleontic:  obv. female  head  (Helen), legend: ;  rev. rider/Dioskouros  (Consolo  Langher  ( 1965),  ( 1996b)  581;  SNG Cop.  Sicily 948).  Second  issue  (Consolo  Langher  ( 1965), ( 1996b)  584;  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 949):  obv.  head  of  Apollo,  leg- ends: ,  ;  rev.cock,or horse's  head,  or  free  horse  (for  the  \"Free  Horse\",  Timoleontic symmachia  coinage,  see  Karlsson  ( 1995)  and  Consolo Langher  ( 1997)  183\u00ad85,  188). 50.  (Tyrrhenoi) Map 47.  Unlocated.  Type:  C: .The  Tyr- rhenoi  are  known exclusively  from  their  C 4s  Greek-style bronze  coinage:  obv.  head  of  Athena  wearing  Attic  helmet, legend: ;  rev.  standing  armed  Athena  (Head,  HN \u00b2 190;  Cutroni  Tusa  ( 1970)  264\u00ad65).  The  coins,  whose  types reveal  Athenian  influence,  are  restruck  on  C 4s  Syracusan issues.  They  may  belong  to  an  anti-Syracusan  ethnic  group, perhaps  Tyrrhenian  mercenaries  fighting T imoleon  (cf. Diod. 16.82.2  (r 339/8);  Cutroni  Tusa  ( 1970)  266).  A  settle- ment  site  of  the  Tyrrhenoi  has  tentatively  been  identified with  sporadic  habitation  remains  at  modern  Alimena  in  the territory of  Himera  (no. 24)  (Bejor  ( 1984b)  with  refs.);  other proposals  include  a  location  in  the  region  of  Syracuse\u00adAitna (Cutroni  Tusa  ( 1970)  266). 51.  Zankle  (Zanklaios)/Messana  (Messanios)  Map  47.  Lat. 38.10,long.  15.35.  Size  of  territory: 4.  Type:  A: .  The  topo- nym  is,  for  Zankle, (SEG 11  1180.8  (C 6);  coins  of  C 6l, infra)  or  ,  (Hecat.  fr. 72;  Hdt. 7.164.1).  The  city- ethnic  is  (IGDS  no. 2  (C 5e);  coin  c. 461,  infra)  or (Hdt. 6.22.2).  For  Messana,  the  toponym  is (IG iv\u00b2.195.ii.78  (C 4m); , (Hdt. 7.164.1);  or  (Polyaen. 5.2.18).  The  city-ethnic  is (SEG 28  431); (Polyaen. 5.2.18); ,  (coins,  infra). Zankle  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Hdt. 6.23.3  and 7.164.1,  and  in  the  urban  and  political  senses  combined  at Hdt. 7.154.2  (Hansen  ( 2000)  205);  it  is  called  patris  at  Diod. 11.76.5  (r 460).  Messana  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at Thuc. 4.25.10\u00ad11  and  in  the  political  sense  at  Thuc. 6.4.6;  it  is called  patris  at  Diod. 14.50.5  (r 399). The  city-ethnic  of  Zankle  is  found  in  the  internal  collec- tive  use  on  C 5f  coins  (infra)  and  in  the  external  collective use sikelia  233 in  IGDS  no. 2  (C 5e),  Hdt. 6.22.2  and  Antiochos  of  Syracuse (FGrHist 555)  fr. 9;  the  external  individual  use  is  found  in Paus. 5.25.11  (rC 6l);  the  city-ethnic  of  Messana  is  found  in the  internal  collective  use  on  C 5  coins  (infra)  and  in  the external  collective use  in  IGDS  nos. 4\u00ad5  ( 488\u00ad485)  and  Thuc. 5.5.1;  the  external  individual  use  is  found  in  SEG 28  431 (c. 467\u00ad450)  and  Diod. 14.40.4  (r 399). According  to  Thuc. 6.4.5,  Zankle  was  originally  settled  by pirates  from  the  Chalkidian  colony  of  Kyme  (no. 57),  possi- bly  implying  some  early  pre-colonial  phase  (see  Antonelli ( 1996)  for  a  full  discussion).  At  a  later  date  a  number  of Chalkidian  and  other  Euboian  settlers  joined  the  settle- ment,  the  oecists  being  Perieres  from  Kyme  and Krataimenes  from  Chalkis  (Thuc. 6.4.5;  Callim.  Aet. ii  fr. 43.58\u00ad59,  Pfeiffer,  with  Ehlers  ( 1933)).  The  implication  may be  that  Zankle  was  founded  in  two  stages:  at  first the settle- ment  served  merely  to  secure  Kymaian-Chalkidian  trading interests;  later,  with  the  participation  of  oecists,  it  was founded  as  a  polis.  According  to  Ps.-Skymnos  283\u00ad86  (possi- bly  drawing  on  Ephor.  fr. 137a;  cf.  Strabo  6.2.2\u00ad3),  however, Zankle  was  founded  by  Naxos  (no. 41)  as  a  sub-colony  at  the same  time  as  Katane  (no. 30)  and  Leontinoi  (no. 33),  i.e. c. 735\u00ad730.  The  date  seems  to  be  confirmed b y  the  archaeo- logical  evidence  (Bacci  ( 1978);  Scibona  ( 1986)  448)  and  also by  the  Zanklaian  participation  in  the  foundation  of  Rhegion (no. 68)  c. 730. The  foundation  of  Mylai  (no. 38)  in  C 8l  as  a  secondary colony  of  Zankle  (Euseb.  Chron. 90bH)  testifies t o  a Zanklaian  area  of  influence along the north c oast  of  Sicily.  In 648,  Zanklaians  and  Syracusan  exiles,  the  so-called Myletidai,  founded  Himera  (no. 24)  in  western  Sicily  (Thuc. 6.5.1;Diod.  13.62.4).  The  continued  ties  with  Himera  are revealed  by  the  fact  that  Skythes,  the  king  of  Zankle  in  C 5e, went  there  as  an  exile  (Hdt. 6.24.1).New  Zanklaian  settlers  at Himera  in  the  same  period  may  be  deduced  from  the  men- tion  of  a  [ ]    in  a  bronze  plaque  from  Himera (Brugnone  ( 1997)  271\u00ad72  et  passim).  To  the  south  the  territ- ory  of  Naxos  formed  a  natural  border  (Thuc. 4.25.7)--all in all  a  chora  of  quite  vast  dimensions.  (For  the  confines of Zanklaian  territory  and  that  of  Longane,  see  Massa  ( 1991) 253.)  Its  name  was  (Theophr.  Hist.  pl. 8.2.8),  and by C 4e  it  was  apparently  dotted  with  fortified phrouria (Diod. 14.57.5\u00ad6).  It is  called  by Thuc. 6.4.5,  \u00b5  at  Paus. 4.23.6,  and  Hdt. 6.23.5  has  a  reference  to    .  Its  borders  are  mentioned  at  Diod. 14.40.4  (r 399). The  change  of  name  from  Zankle  to  Messana  occurred c. 488/7  and  was  the  result  of  tumultous  events:  at  the  time  of the  Ionian  Revolt,  Zankle  had  sent  messengers  to  Ionia  and invited  settlers  to  participate  in  the  foundation  of  an  Ionian polis  at  Kale  Akte  (Hdt. 6.22.2;  cf.  C.  Marconi  ( 1994)).  A number  of  Samian  aristocrats  wanted  to  flee Samos on account  of  their  role  in  the  Ionian  Revolt;  they  accepted  the invitation  and  arrived  at  Lokroi  Epizephyrioi  (no. 59)  at  a time  when  the  Zanklaian  forces  were  laying  siege  to  a  Sikel town;  the  Rhegian  tyrant  Anaxilas  persuaded  the  Samians  to capture  the  undefended  town  of  Zankle,  which  they  did (Hdt. 6.23.2\u00ad3).  The  Zanklaians  called  upon  their  ally, Hippokrates,  the  tyrant  of  Gela  (at  this  time  Zankle  was  pre- sumably  a  subordinate  ally  of  Hippokrates,  who  had  defeat- ed  the  city  in  an  earlier  war,  cf.  Hdt. 7.154.2);  Hippokrates arrived  with  an  army  and  deposed  Skythes,  the  ruler  of Zankle  (called  basileus  (Hdt. 6.23.1)  or  mounarchos  (Hdt. 6.23.4);  cf.  Carlier  ( 1984)  469\u00ad70).  Hippokrates  then  negoti- ated  with  the  Samians  and  betrayed  the  Zanklaians  to  them in  return  for  \"half  of  all  the  moveable  property  and  slaves  in the  town,  and  everything  in  the  open  country\"  (Hdt. 6.23.5). He  enslaved  the  greater  part  of  the  betrayed  Zanklaians,  but turned  the  300  \"leading  men  among  them\"  over  to  the Samians  ( 6.23.6).  Later,  Anaxilas  of  Rhegion  drove  out  the Samians,  founded  a  city  of  mixed  ethnicity,  and  changed  the  name  to  Messana  after  his  own  original  homeland (Thuc. 6.4.6). The  treaty  of 405  between  Dionysios  and  Carthage  stipulated  that  Messana  be  autonomos  (Diod. 13.114.1; Staatsvertr\u00e4ge  no. 210).  In  399  the  Messanian  army  deserted their  generals  in  a  war  against  Dionysios  because  the  demos had  not  ratified the campaign (Diod. 14.40  5;  Costabile ( 1978)).  In  396  Himilkon  captured  Messana,  which  was  now allied  with  Dionysios  (Diod. 14.57),  but  in  395  the  city  was repopulated  by  Dionysios,  who  settled  1,000  Lokrians, 4,000 Medmaians  and  600  Peloponnesian  Messenians  (who  were, however,  quickly  relocated  to  Tyndaris),  and  the  city  became practically  a  Syracusan  colony,  above  all  of  military  stamp (Diod. 14.78.5).  The  pro-Dionysian  faction,  however,  was expelled  again  in  394  (Diod. 14.88.5). Monarchy  is  attested  at  Zankle  in  the  time  of  Skythes (supra),  who,  however,  seems  to  have  been  a  subordinate  of Hippokrates  of  Gela  (supra).  Diod. 11.48.2  (r 476)  describes Anaxilas  as  being  at  his  death  tyrant  of  both  Rhegion  and Zankle  (cf.  Berve  ( 1967)  156).  In  461,\"the  Rhegians  with  the Zanklaians\"expelled  the  sons  of  Anaxilas  and  liberated  their cities  (Diod. 11.76.5).  The  koinon  dogma  agreed  upon  by  the Sicilian  cities  after  the  fall  of  the  tyranny  at  Syracuse  stipu- lated  that  all  the  mercenaries  installed  by  tyrants  in  the  cities of  the  island  were  to  settle      (Diod. 11.76.5; cf.  CAH \u00b2  v. 157;  Freeman  ( 1891\u00ad94)  ii. 316\u00ad17).  A  stasis  broke 234 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo out  in  424\u00ad422  during  which  one  party  called  in  help  from Lokroi;  the  Lokrians  sent  some  epoikoi  who  were  later  driv- en  out  (Thuc. 5.5.1).Another  stasis  is  mentioned  for  the  year 415  (Thuc. 6.74.1);  cf.  Polyaen. 5.2.18.  Ethnic  animosities seem  to  have  played  a  role  in  these  staseis  (Berger  ( 1992) 54\u00ad55).  In  337,  Timoleon  deposed  the  tyrant  Hippon  (Plut. Tim. 34.3). IGDS  no. 2.9,C6  SEG 11  1180)  reads  [ ]  \u00b5  [ ]-, and  the  inscription  presumably  recorded  or  referred  to a treaty  of  symmachia  between  Zankle  and  one  or  more unknown  partner(s).  In  426  Messana  entered  into  a  sym- machia  with  Athens  (Thuc. 3.90.4).  The  alliance  was  short- lived,  and  the  next  year  Syracusans  and  Lokrians  occupied Messana,  which  had  revolted  from  Athens  (Thuc. 4.1.1). A  Messanian  army  and  navy  are  mentioned  at  Thuc. 4.25.7;Diod.  14.40.4  (r 399)  mentions  an  army of 4,000  foot and 400  horse,  in  addition  to  thirty  triremes.  The  organisa- tion  of  the  army was  probably  based  on  a  system  of  phylai, since  at  3.90.2  Thucydides  says  that  there  were           .Commanders (strategoi)  are  mentioned  at  Diod. 14.40.5  (r 399). Olympic  victories  were  achieved  by  Leontiskos  in  456  and 452  (Olympionikai 271,  285)  and  by  Symmachos  in  428 (Olympionikai 325).  A  C 6  communal  Zanklaian  dedication of  spoils  at  Olympia  is  found  as  SEG 11  1180.9,1205  and 15  246 (  IGDS  no. 2);  Messanian  dedications  are  attested  by  SEG 24  313\u00ad14  (C 5e).  In  communal  mourning  the  Messenians dedicated  a  bronze  statue  at  Olympia  to  commemorate  a chorus  of  boys  who  drowned  on  their  way  to  a  festival  at Rhegion  (Paus. 5.25.2\u00ad5  (rC 5m);  Cordano  ( 1980);  Pritchett ( 1999)  252\u00ad54).  In  356/5,  a  citizen  of  Messana  served  as Epidaurian  theorodokos  (IG iv\u00b2.195.ii.78). Zankle  was  founded  near  the  narrowest  point  of  the Straits  c. 10  km  south  of  Cape  Pelorus  on  a  low  coastal plateau  facing  a  natural,  sickle-shaped  harbour  from  which the  city  took  its  Sikel  name  (Thuc. 6.4.5).  The  ancient  city has  suffered  heavily  from  the  later  urban  history  of  the  site and  from  numerous  earthquakes  and  landslides:  the  Archaic and  Classical  remains  are  often  4\u00ad5  m  below  the  present  sur- face.  The  settlement  lay  along  the  inner  harbour  and  upon the  sickle-shaped  peninsula  that  enclosed  the  harbour.  The main  area  of  habitation  seems  to  have  been  the  area  west  and south  of  the  harbour,  stretching  c. 1  km  inland  from  the  coast in  an  area  confined t o  the  south  by  the  river  Cammaro  and to  the  north-east  by  the  harbour--in all c. 50\u00ad60  ha  (Vallet ( 1958)  113\u00ad16,  pl.  I;  Scibona  ( 1986)).  No  remains  of  the Archaic  or  Classical  circuit  wall  are  known  (for  poliorkiai, see  Hdt. 7.154.2  ( 490s);  Plut.  Tim. 34.3  (r 337);  cf.  Diod. 14.56.4,  57.3,  58.3,  78.5  and 87.1  attesting  the  existence  of  for- tifications in the  390s).  During  C 5  the  size  of  the  habitation area  may  have  been  somewhat  restricted  compared  to  the Archaic  city;  the  C 5  cemetery  is  located  inside  the  area  of  the Archaic  city,  though  this  may  simply  indicate  a  change  in location  of  habitation  area  (Scibona  ( 1986)  450,  453).  There is  some  evidence  of  an  overall  orthogonal  plan  from  the early  period  of  the  settlement  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea  ( 1972\u00ad73) 176\u00ad77;  Scibona  ( 1986)  449\u00ad52).  The  harbour  is  known  from early  coin  types,  some  of  which  seem  to  show  it  equipped inside  with  buildings  or  wharves.  Several  kilns  attest  to  an extensive  industrial  quarter  inside  the  urban  area  (Bacci ( 1995)  640).A  theatre  is  mentioned  by  Plut.  Tim. 34.4.(r337); the  same  passage  refers  to  schools  (didaskaleia). On  the  outermost  part  of  the  sickle-shaped  peninsula  was a  sanctuary;  the  cult  is  unknown,  but  the  finds show that its history  goes  back  to  the  period  of  foundation  (Orsi  ( 1929) 38\u00ad46).  This  is  the  main  archaeological  testimony  of  cult from  the  city  itself,  apart  from  the  C 5  votive  relief  from  a sanctuary(?)  dedicated  to  the  chthonic  divinities  (Orsi ( 1912)).  For  extra-urban  sanctuaries,  there  is  the  tradition  of the  Poseidon  sanctuary  on  Cape  Pelorus  (Diod. 4.85.5\u00ad6 (r  time  of  foundation)).  The  striding  Zeus  shown  on  the obv.  of  the  single  known  tetradrachm  from  an  issue  struck probably  in  461  commemorating  the  liberation  from  tyran- ny  may  refer  to the  cult  of  Eleutheria  (cf.  infra). Coinage  began  c. 525  with  drachms  based  upon  the Euboian  standard,  with  as  lower  denominations  obols  and onkiai  (C.  Boehringer  ( 1984\u00ad85)  108\u00ad19).  The  first issue is known  in  four  series,  lasting  to  the  conquest  of  Zankle  by Hippokrates.  The  obv.  type,  a  dolphin  within  a  sickle- shaped  harbour,  refers  to  the  name  and  setting  of  the  city (Belloni  ( 1977)),  legends: ,  ,  ; rev.  incuse  squares  with  shell  in  centre  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 387\u00ad88).An  example  with  incuse  repetition  of  the  obverse  is a  unique  example  of  the  incuse  fabric  of  Magna  Graecia used  in  Sicily  (C.  Boehringer  ( 1984\u00ad85)  109,  pl. 11.3). The  Samian  occupation  494/3\u00ad489/8  is  reflected in tetradrachms  struck  on  the  Euboian\u00adAttic  standard,  the obv.  with  a  frontal  lion  scalp,  the  rev.  with  a  prow of  a  ship (the  samaina),  and  on  some  a  retrograde  letter  of  the sequence  A  to E.  Each  letter  probably  represented  one  year's coinage,  and  the  letter  sequence  therefore  corresponds  to the  five y ears  of  Samian  occupation.  Of  the  lower  denomi- nations  the  diobols  carry  the  additional  symbol  of  a  helmet on  the  rev.(Barron ( 1966)  40\u00ad43;  SNG  Cop.  Suppl. 68). The  first issues of  Anaxilas'  regime,  spanning  the  period 488\u00ad480,  were  tetradrachms  struck  on  the  Euboian\u00adAttic sikelia  235 standard  with  obv.  lion's  head  facing;  rev.  forepart  of  calf, legend:  (Caccamo  Caltabiano  ( 1993) 17\u00ad31).  From  480  Anaxilas  struck  tetradrachms  with  obv. biga  of  mules;  rev.  running  hare,  in  commemoration  of  his victory  at  Olympia,  legend: ;  this  becomes the  canonical  C 5  type,  with  smaller  denominations--main- ly  litrai  and  its  fractions  (ibid. 31ff;  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 389\u00ad90). The  fall  of  the  tyranny  in  461  allowed  for  a  short  period the  re-establishment  of  the  Zanklaian  faction,  which  struck a  commemorative  issue  known  from  a  unique  tetradrachm: obv.  Zeus  at  altar  hurling  thunderbolt;  rev.  dolphin,  shell, legend:  ;  litrai  have  the  legend   (Caccamo  Caltabiano  ( 1993)  63\u00ad66,  238;  cf.  also  Lacroix ( 1965)  24\u00ad25).  These  were  soon  followed  by  Messanian issues.  The  legend  of  the  reverse  changed  the  earlier  Ionic spelling  to Doric  or  c. 450  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 393\u00ad94).  Later  issues  use  the  four-stroke sigma  instead  of  the  rounded  Chalkidian  letter (Caccamo  Caltabiano  ( 1993)  68\u00ad69;  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 396\u00ad97).The  rare issue  of  a  gold  coinage  c. 455  may  reflect the demands  of  a  military  campaign  (Stazio  ( 1988)  506\u00ad7; Caccamo  Caltabiano  ( 1993)  73\u00ad75).  An issue  from  c. 425 carries  on  the  obv.  the  personification of  the  city  (a  female charioteer)  and  the  legend  (Caccamo Caltabiano  ( 1993)  101\u00ad3;  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 399\u00ad406).  Bronze coinage  with  related  types  and  the  legend  () began c. 425  (Caccamo  Caltabiano  ( 1993)  111\u00ad14;  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 417\u00ad19). Zankle  founded  Mylai  (no. 38)  in  716,  presumably  as  a dependent  polis  (supra);  in  collaboration  with  Syracusan exiles,  it  founded  Himera  (no. 24)  in  648;  and  it  also  parti- cipated  in  the  foundation  of  Rhegion  (no. 68)  c. 730. 236 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo", "Galeria": "Identifier: 19. , (Galarinos) Map  47.Unlocated  (Manni  ( 1981) 175\u00ad76;  Scibona  ( 1989)  536).  Type:  C: .  The  toponym  is or ,  at  Diod. 16.67.3,  19.104.1;  the  city- ethnic  is  (C 5m  coins,  infra). Galeria  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  and  political  senses  at Diod. 16.67.3  (r 345/4);  politai  are  mentioned  at  Diod. 19.104.1 (r 312).  The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found on  C 5m  coins  (infra).  According  to  Steph.  Byz. 196.11, Galeria  was  a  foundation  by  the  Sikel  Morgos;  it  is  included here  on  account  of  its  Greek-inspired  coinage  (infra). Reception  of  an  embassy  is  implied  by  Diod. 16.67.3 (r 345/4):  Entella  sent  for  help  against  the  Carthaginians,  and Galeria  responded  by  sending  1,000  hoplites,  who  were  all killed. Galeria  struck  two  distinct  issues  of  silver  litrai.  The  earli- er  issue  dates  to C 5m:  obv.  Zeus  seated  on  throne  holding eagle-tipped  sceptre,  legend: ;rev.Dionysos stand- ing,  holding  kantharos  and  vine,  legend: .The iconography  is  known  from  coins  of  Aitna  (no. 8)  and  Naxos (no. 41),  but  the  style  is  indigenous.  A  later  issue  dates  to 430\u00ad420  and  is  known  from  three  specimens:  obv.  Dionysos holding  kantharos  and  thyrsos;  rev.  vine  and  bunch  of grapes,  legend: (Head,  HN \u00b2139;  Jenkins ( 1975)  83\u00ad85;  Marwitz  ( 1982)  56;  Cutroni  Tusa  ( 1984\u00ad85) 290).  The  type  depicting  Zeus  Soter  seems  to  indicate  a Greek  cult  (Gabrici  ( 1959)  19;  Marwitz  ( 1982)). 17.Gela  (Geloios,  Geloaios) Map  47.  Lat. 37.05,long. 14.15.

The  uncon- tracted  city-ethnic  is  (IGDS  no. 132  ( 550\u00ad525)), contracted to (Hdt. 7.154.1;  Thuc. 7.58.1;  IGDS  no. 158  (C 5e));  the  form  is  found  in  SEG 24  303 (C 6\u00adC5),  possibly  an  Ionic  form,  but  see  IGDS  notes  ad 132 and  Cordiano  ( 1995),  who  suggests  reading  ,  i.e. the  city-ethnic  of  Hyele  (no. 54),  not  Gela. Gela  is  called  polis  in  the  political  sense  by  Thuc. 6.4.3,and in  the  urban  sense  by  Thuc. 6.4.3  and  Theopomp.  fr. 358. Polites  occurs  at  Hdt. 7.155.1  and  astos  at  Hdt. 7.156.2.Its politeia  was  described  by  Aristotle  (Arist.  fr. 491).  A  C 5 bronze  weight  is  inscribed  \u00b5&lt;  &gt; (IGDS  no. 152).  It  is called  patris  in  Empedokles  fr. 156.4  (DK). The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  in IGDS  no. 153  (C 5e)  and  on  C 5  coins  (infra).  The  external  col- lective  use  is  found  in  Hdt. 7.156.2  and  Thuc. 7.58.1;  the external  individual  use  is  found  in  IGDS  no. 132  ( 550\u00ad525), IvO 142  (c. 488)  and  IG ii\u00b2  8460  (C 4e). Gela  was  founded  45  years  after  Syracuse,  i.e.  in  689/8,by colonists  from  Rhodos  and  Crete  (Thuc. 6.4.3);  according  to Hdt. 7.153.1  by  Lindians  (no. 997)  from  Rhodos.  The  oecists were  the  Rhodian  Antiphemos  and  the  Cretan  Entimos (Thuc. 6.4.3;  cf.  the  C 6\u00adC5  dedication  to  Antiphemos:  IGDS no. 135,  indicating  a  cult  of  the  oecist  (Orlandini  ( 1968) 44\u00ad46)).  The  colonists  instituted  \u00b5\u00b5   at  Gela (Thuc. 6.4.3).  Early  Geloan  expansion  into  the  hinterland may  be  inferred  from  the  sack  of  Omphake,  a  \u00b5 ,by Antiphemos (Paus.8.46.2  (rC 7));  and  conflicts between  Geloans  and  the  indigenous  population  are  attest- ed  in  other  sources,  e.g.  Artemon  (FGrHist 569)  fr. 1  and  the Lindian  Temple  Chronicle  25  Xenagoras  (FGrHist 240)  fr. 12,  which  mentions  an        dedicated to  Athena  Lindia  by  the  Geloans.  It  was  probably  this  expan- sionist  policy  that  led  to  the  foundation  of  Akragas  (no. 9), which  was  founded  108  years  after  Gela's  own  foundation, i.e.  c. 580  (Thuc. 6.4.4;  cf.  Pind.  Ol. 2.93  with  schol. 576). The  plateau  of  Gela  dominated  the  coastal  plain  and  the vast  inland  lowland.  Apparently,  the  plain  was  mainly  agricultural  and  without  settlements.  It  was  delimited  by  a row  of  hills  settled  with  indigenous  sites  which  all  came under  Geloan  influence in C 7f,  soon  after  the  foundation  of Gela.  Two  of  the  larger  cities  were  Omphake  (perhaps  mod- ern  Butera:  see  most  recently  Adamesteanu  ( 1994\u00ad95)  113), subjected  by  Gela  early  on  (supra),  and  Maktorion  (possibly modern  Monte  Bubbonia:  Bejor  ( 1991)  305).  The  tracts along  the  valleys  of  the  rivers  Salso  (ancient  Himera), Dessueri  and  Maroglio  (ancient  Gela  and  its  tributaries) came  under  Gela's  influence from C 6e,  as  far  inland  as Caltanisetta  (sites  of Sabucina;  Gibil  Gabib)  and Caltagirone  (site  of  Monte  San  Mauro,  perhaps  a Chalkidian  settlement  and  therefore  on  the  edge  of  the Geloan  area  of  influence) (Orlandini ( 1962);  see  Euboia  (no. 192 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo 15)).  Eastwards  the  border  between  Gela  and  Kamarina  (no. 28)  was  marked  by  the  Dirillo  valley,  with  a  rural  sanctuary at  Feudo  Nobile  dedicated  to  chthonic  divinities (Canzanella  ( 1989)).  Westwards  Geloan  influence may have reached  as  far  as  the  river  Platani  (ancient  Halykos),  the eastern  frontier  of  Selinous  (no. 44).  In  C 7  the  immediate hinterland  of  Gela  comprised  an  area  of  about  375  km \u00b2,but the  period  of  Hippokrates  and  Gelon  saw  a  Geloan  domin- ion  comprising  large  tracts  of  north-east  (Chalkidian)  and south-east  (Syracusan)  Sicily.  Philistos  (FGrHist 556)  fr. 5 implies  a  C 6m  treaty  of  symmachia  between  Gela  and Kamarina,  and  possibly  between  Gela  and  Syracuse  (no. 47). From c. 505,Gela  was  governed  by  tyrants,  beginning  with the  rule  of  Kleandros  and  Hippokrates,  sons  of  the  Olympic victor  Pantares  (Olympionikai 151).Kleandros  was  tyrant  for seven  years  (Hdt. 7.154.1;Arist.Pol.1316a37),and  after  him  his brother  Hippokrates  took  over   \u00b5,  also  for seven  years  (Hdt. 7.155.1;  cf. 6.23.3  and  Thuc. 6.5.3: ).  Hippokrates  conducted  an  aggressive  foreign policy  both  against  the  indigenous  population  (Hdt. 7.154.2\u00ad3)  and  against  the  Greek  cities  of  Kallipolis  (no. 27), Naxos  (no. 41),  Zankle  (no. 51)  and  Leontinoi  (no. 33),  all  of which  he  \"enslaved\"  (Hdt. 7.154.2).  He  also  managed  to defeat  the  Syracusans  in  battle  and  to  lay  siege  to  their  city, but  this  conflict was settled through arbitration b y  Corinth (no. 227)  and  Korkyra  (no. 123)  by  which  Syracuse  had  to cede  Kamarina  to  Hippokrates  (Hdt. 7.154.2\u00ad3).  Kamarina was  then  refounded  by  Gela  with  Hippokrates  as  oecist (Thuc. 6.5.3;  Philistos  (FGrHist 556)  fr. 15).  When  Kamarina was  destroyed  by  Gelon  in  484,  the  Geloans  refounded  it once  again  c. 461  (Thuc. 6.4.3;Diod.  11.76.5);  see  further Berve  ( 1967)  137\u00ad40.  Zankle  and  its  ruler  Skythes  were dependent  allies  of  Hippokrates  (Hdt. 7.154.2;see Zankle/Messana  (no. 51)). On  Hippokrates'  death,  the  citizens  of  Gela  attempted  to free  themselves  from  tyranny,  but  Gelon,  the  former doryphoros  of  Hippokrates,  defeated  them  in  battle  and  took power  (Hdt. 7.155.1).  When  in  485  Gelon  became  tyrant  of Syracuse,  he  moved  his  seat  as  well  as  \"more  than  half  \"of  the Geloan  astoi  to  that  city  (Hdt. 7.156.2).  The  government  of Gela  was  entrusted  to Gelon's  brother,  Hieron  (Hdt. 7.156.6), who  later  inherited  the  tyranny  of  Syracuse  and  was  suc- ceeded  at  Gela  by  another  brother,  Polyzalos  (F.Delphes iii.4 452:[ ]  ...  [ ]  []).  Tyranny  at  Gela  presumably came  to  an  end  in  466/5  (Berve ( 1967)  141). In 405  Himilkon  besieged,  pillaged  and  destroyed  (?)  Gela  (Diod. 13.108\u00ad111.1\u00ad2),and  after  the  defeat  of  Dionysios the  peace  treaty  between  Carthage  and  Syracuse  (no. 47) stipulated  that  Gela  be  an  ateichistos  tributary  of  Carthage (Diod. 13.114.1;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 210).  Gela  was  one  of  the Timoleontic  refoundations  (Plut.  Tim. 35.1\u00ad2;  Talbert  ( 1974) 153\u00ad55,  204). Our  sources  for  the  military  strength  of  Gela  provide  us with  scanty  information  about  the  size  of  the  polis:  a contin- gent  of 500  hippeis  is  mentioned  by  Diod. 13.83.2  (rC 5s;  cf. Timaios  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 26a).  In  415,  during  the  Athenian attack, 200  Geloan  cavalry  assisted  Syracuse  (Thuc. 6.67.2), and  the  same  number  was  sent  in  413  (Thuc. 7.33.2).  In  414  a small  contingent  from  Gela  under  the  command  of Gylippos  marched  to  the  support  of  Syracuse  (Thuc. 7.1.5), and  in  413  a  navy  (nautikon)  of  five ships as w ell  as  400  akon- tistai  were  sent  to  Syracuse  (Thuc. 7.33.1).  At  the  battle  of Himera  in  406  a  contingent  from  Gela  fought  at  the  side  of Kamarina  (no. 28)  and  Syracuse  (no. 47)  (Diod. 13.86.5).  A C 6\u00adC5  Geloan  defeat  at  the  hands  of  Rhegion  (no. 68)  is attested  by  SEG 24  303. Civil  war  is  attested,  as  in  all  other  major  Sicilian  poleis:an early  stasis  (C 7\u00adC6)  was  resolved  without  bloodshed  by  an ancestor  of  Gelon  (Hdt. 7.153.2).  Another  stasis,  in  which Dionysios  I  interfered,  is  mentioned  for  the  year  406:  the demos  rose  against  the  despoteia  of  the  dynatotatoi  and  suc- ceeded  owing  to  Dionysios'  assistance;  in  this  connection the  ekklesia  and  psephismata  are  mentioned  (Diod. 13.93.2\u00ad4;  Berger  ( 1992)  23\u00ad25). Diplomatic  activities  comprise  reception  of  envoys (implied  by Diod. 11.68.1  (r 466))  as  well  as  sending  of  envoys (Timaios  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 22  (r 424);  Diod. 13.93.4  (r 406)).  In 424,  Gela  hosted  a  pan-Sicilian  peace  congress,  which  had developed  from  an  ekecheiria  between  Kamarina  (no. 28)  and Gela  (Thuc. 5.58,  65;  Timaios  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 22).  A  Geloan served  as  Epidaurian  theorodokos  in 356/5  (IG iv\u00b2.195.ii.83). Another  was  appointed  Samian  proxenos  in  C 4l  (IG xii.633). The  rulers  of  C 5f  Gela  displayed  their  power  at  the Panhellenic  sanctuaries.  Gelon  was  victorious  at  Olympia  in 484  (Olympionikai 158;  IvO 143  and  Paus. 6.9.4;Harrell ( 2002));  and  Polyzalos  was  victor  at  Delphi  c. 478  (SEG 3  396; LSAG 266,  275  no. 9;  F.Delphes iii.4452;  cf.  Harrell  ( 2002) 460\u00ad62).  For  Gelon's  donations  at  Delphi:  Syll. \u00b333\u00ad34  (cf. Harrell  ( 2002)  453\u00ad55).  Gela  had  a  thesauros  at  Olympia (Paus. 6.19.15),  a  richly  furnished  C 6m  building,  restruc- tured  in  C 5f  (Mertens-Horn  and  Viola  ( 1990)  238\u00ad39). Communal  consultation  of  oracles  is  implied  by  Diod. 13.108.4,  which  also  attests  to  an  internal  communal  dedica- tion  of  a  bronze  image  of  Apollo. The  city  occupied  the  east\u00adwest-oriented  coastal  plateau, and  during  C 7\u00adC5  a  part  of  the  lowland  plain  to  the  north sikelia  193 (Spagnolo  ( 1991)).  The  easternmost  part  of  the  plateau,  with C 7  sanctuaries,  is  normally  regarded  as  the  acropolis  of  the city  (there  is  no  ancient  attestation  of  the  term).  The  monu- mental  C 6  temple  was  replaced  by  a  C 5e  temple  located  fur- ther  east  (Orlandini  ( 1968)  21\u00ad25;  T.Van  Compernolle  ( 1989) 68\u00ad69).  The  major  divinity  of  the  sanctuary  was  Athena, probably  Athena  Lindia  (Fischer-Hansen  ( 1996)  322\u00ad27  with refs.).  There  are  clear  signs  of  some  continuity  of  Greek occupation  during  the  C 4f  and  of  continuity  of  cult. The  central  part  of  the  plateau  was  probably  the  main habitation  area  in  the  Archaic  and  early  Classical  periods, delimited  further  to  the  west  by  the  early  cemeteries (Shepherd  ( 1995)  60\u00ad70).  There  is  evidence  of  C 8l  Greek occupation,  a  pre-colonial  phase  apparently  supporting  the statement  by Thuc. 6.4.3  that  an  area  of  Gela  called  Lindioi was  occupied  before  the  founding  of  Gela  (for  a  colonisa- tion  of  Gela  in  two  phases,  see  Wentker  ( 1956);  Fiorentini and  De  Miro  ( 1983)).  (Mortuary  evidence,  too,  indicates  a Greek  presence  from  the  end  of  C 8.)  Architectural  terracot- tas  have  revealed  a  large  sanctuary,  consisting  of  at  least  two monumental  temples  (Fischer-Hansen  ( 1996)  327\u00ad32  with refs.);  the  identity  of  the  divinity  is  uncertain;  Orlandini ( 1968)  31  suggests  Zeus  Atabyrios. No  traces  of  a  circuit  wall  from  the  period  of  foundation have  been  found  so  far,  though  the  existence  of--presum- ably  early--walls is implied b y  Thuc. 6.4.3.  There  are remains  of  a  C 6  circuit  wall,  possibly  raised  in  connection with  C 6l  civic  strife  (Orlandini  ( 1961)  141\u00ad44),or,if  in  part  of later  origin,  in  connection  with  the  threat  of  the Carthaginians  in  C 5l  (De  Miro  and  Fiorentini  ( 1976\u00ad77) 434\u00ad35).  Fortifications in C 4l  are  attested  by  Diod. 19.107.5 (r 317)  and  19.110.2\u00ad3  (r 311). Little  is  known  of  the  habitation  area  on  the  plateau (Buongiovanni  and  Canzanella  ( 1990)  13).  The  Archaic  city incorporated  the  north  slope  of  the  plateau  and  part  of  the plain  below  (Spagnolo  ( 1991)).  The  size  of  the  Classical  city, including  a  part  of  the  lowland  plains  to  the  north  but excluding  the  western  cemetery  and  including  the  eastern sanctuary,  was  about  200  ha.  There  is  clear  evidence  of  the destruction  by  the  Carthaginians  in  405,  but  also  of  a  re- establishment  of  the  Greek  settlement  soon  after  (Fiorentini ( 2002)).  The  Timoleontic  refoundation  of  Gela  with  a  new overall  urban  plan  comprised  habitation  quarters  in  ter- races  along  the  north  slope  and  on  part  of  the  upper  plateau, incorporating  also  a  new  industrial  quarter,  public  baths and  the  western  part  of  the  plateau,  enclosed  by  the  impres- sive  circuit  walls  at  Capo  Soprano  (Buongiovanni  and Canzanella  ( 1990)  20\u00ad22;  Panvini  ( 1996)  100\u00ad20). There  is  further  evidence  of  urban  cults:  a  sanctuary  on the  southern  slope  was  dedicated  to  Hera  (Orlandini  ( 1968) 31\u00ad33;  IGDS  nos. 137\u00ad38),  and  close  by  was  the  heroon  for the  oikistes  Antiphemos  (supra).  Gela  was  surrounded  by  a number  of  suburban  sanctuaries  (surveys:  Orlandini ( 1968);  Fiorentini  ( 1985)),  with  paramount  importance assigned  to  sanctuaries  for  Demeter  (Kron  ( 1992);  Hinz ( 1998)  55\u00ad69).  Other  sanctuaries,  previously  thought  to  be suburban,  are  now  known  to  have  been  located  within  the northern  boundary  of  the  city  (Orlandini  ( 1968)  pl. i.5.6; Spagnolo  ( 1991)  69).  The  stay  of  Aischylos  at  Gela  surely implies  that  the  city  had  a  theatre  in  C 5m.  A  C 7\u00adC5  build- ing  complex  located  on  the  coast  south-east  of  the  plateau near  the  estuary  of  the  river  Gelas  has  been  interpreted  as harbour  structures  (Fiorentini  ( 1985)  22;  Panvini  ( 1996) 54\u00ad57). Gela  began  minting  on  the  initiative  of  Gelon,  c. 490\u00ad485. The  first issue was of  didrachms  and  tetradrachms  on  the Attic\u00adEuboian  standard,  obv.  naked  rider;  rev.  forepart  of man-headed  bull,  legends: (Jenkins  ( 1970)  25).  A second  issue,  mostly  of  tetradrachms,  c. 480\u00ad470,  is  strongly influenced b y  the  Syracusan  mint  and  has  obv.  four-horse chariot  with  a  flying N ike  above;  rev.  forepart  of  man-faced bull,  legends: , .  Issues  with  the  same  obv.  and rev.  types,  and  variants  including  didrachms  and  drachms, are  known  until  C 5l  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 251\u00ad66);  drachms  have obv.  legend (Jenkins  ( 1970)  49).  Tetradrachms from  c. 440\u00ad430  have  the  standard  rev.  type,  but  a  standing female  figure crowns the bull's head w ith  a  wreath  (a  local nymph  or  water-goddess  in  the  role  of  Nike?);  legend: .The  obv.  type  is  very  similar  to  obv. dies  from  Himera  (Jenkins  ( 1970)  71\u00ad72).  From  c. 425  the tetradrachms  carry  the  obv. legend ; [..];  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 269\u00ad70,  277,  279). Smaller  denominations  (didrachms  and  litrai)  have  as  types horseman  or  head  of  river-god  or  Demeter  and  the  legend or (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 271\u00ad75,  280\u00ad81). A  gold  coinage  (dilitron  and  litra)  was  issued  in  C 5l,  proba- bly  to  pay  the  mercenary  armies  fighting the Carthaginians in 406/5  (Diod. 13.93).  The  rev.  of  the  gold  litra  has  as  type head  of  the  deity  Sosipolis,  legend: (SNG Cop.  Sicily 276).  Bronze  coinage  began  c. 420  (Jenkins  ( 1979); SNG  Cop.  Sicily 282\u00ad87).  The  refoundation  of  Gela  by Timoleon  was  marked  by  a  new  issue  of  silver  litrai;  the  obv. type  of  a  warrior  sacrificing a r am  is  variously  interpreted  as Antiphemos,  the  oecist  of  Gela,  or  as  Timoleon  himself  in the  guise  of  the  oecist  of  New  Gela  (Jenkins  ( 1979);  SNG Cop.  Sicily 288). 194 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo 18.  Heloron  (Ailoros) Map  47.  Lat. 36.50,long.  15.05.  Size of  territory:  ? Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is  ,  (Ps.- Skylax 13)  or  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iv. 100  ( 230\u00ad210); Steph.  Byz. 270.3).The  city-ethnic  is  (Diod. 23.4.1) or '  (Etym.  Magn. 333.3). Heloron  is  explicitly  called  a  polis  (  ) in the urban  sense  in  Ps.-Skylax  13,  where  this  phrase  is  found under  the  general  heading       (which is  opposed  to   \u00b5 ), but  apart  from  that there  is  no  evidence  for  its  status  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical periods.  The  evidence  for  Heloron  as  a  polis  in  the  political sense  is  C 3:  like  Akrai  (no. 10),  the  city  is  listed  in  the  treaty between  Syracuse  and  Rome  of 263  as  a  polis  assigned  to Hieron  II  (Diod. 23.4.1  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge  no. 479);  this  may suggest  dependence  on  Syracuse  (no. 47)  at  an  earlier  date (infra).  In  assessing  the  polis  status  of  Heloron,  the  fact  that it  is  listed  in  the  Delphic  list  of  theorodokoi  ( 230\u00ad210)  (BCH ( 1921)  iv.100;  cf.  Manganaro  ( 1964a)  420)  may  have  some retrospective  value.  According  to Ael.  NA 12.30,Heloron  was once  a  .  There are  no  written sources  for  the  foundation  of  Heloron,  and  there  are  no coins.  Heloron  is  here  defined as a polis  type A  on  the  basis  of Ps.-Skylax 13,  but  its  polis  status  is  uncertain  given  the  prox- imity  of  Syracuse;  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  Heloron  was  an early  military  outpost  in  the  southern  dominion  of Syracuse,  though  it  may  have been  a  dependent  polis founded  as  a  fortress  (as  has  been  suggested  for  Kasmenai  by  Hansen  ( 1997a)  36;  cf.  Akrai  (no. 10)  and  Kasmenai  (no. 29)). To  the  west,  Heloron's  territory bordered  upon  the  territ- ory  of  Kamarina  (no. 28).  Heloron  was  founded  on  a  coastal plateau  about  18  km  south  of  Syracuse  and  c. 400  m  to  the north  of  the  river  Tellaro  (  ancient  Heloros);  (morphology of  the  site:  Voza  ( 1978)  pl. 37,  1;  plan  of  site:  Voza  ( 1980\u00ad81) pl. 130).  Archaeological  evidence  points  to  a  foundation  in C 8l\u00adC7e  (Voza  ( 1973a)  117  no. 381;(1978));  so  Syracuse secured  its  interests  southwards  before  founding  the  sec- ondary  colonies  of  Akrai,  Kasmenai  and  Kamarina  (Di  Vita ( 1956)).An  abundance  of  Greek  C 7\u00adC6m  material  is  known from  the  site,  whereas  limited  C 5  material  suggests  that  this was  a  period  of  recession.  The  city  prospered  during  the period  of  Timoleon,  and  above  all  in  the  Hellenistic  period. The  C 6  circuit  wall  was  built  in  a  pseudo-isodomic  tech- nique  as  a  double  curtain-wall  with  internal  fill ( emplekton), in  all  2.80  m  wide  (Orsi  et al.( 1966)  310\u00ad12).  A  local  lime- stone  was  used,  as  well  as  odd  material,  such  as  a  C 6  tomb- stone  (IGDS  no. 98).  The  Archaic  circuit  wall  was incorporated  in  the  C 4  fortification when the wall was strengthened  and  towers  were  added  (Orsi  et al.( 1966) 220\u00ad31).  The  C 4  circuit  wall  is  known  on  the  north,  west  and south  of  the  town,  its  course  following  the  edge  of  the  habi- tation  plateau;  the  eastern  side  facing  the  sea  also  seems  to have  been  fortified. The  habitation  area  comprised  about  9  ha.  The  1,500  seat- ing  capacity  of  the  C 4\u00adC2  theatre  (infra)  gives  some  indica- tion  of  population  size  in  the  late  Classical  period. The  main  routes  across  the  plateau  were  not  laid  out  in straight  lines  but  in  accordance  with  the  uneven  terrain-- uncommon  in  Western  Greek  urban  planning  (Voza ( 1980\u00ad81)  686\u00ad87).  Though  this  road  system  is  known  pri- marily  from  its  Hellenistic  phase,  there  is  little  doubt  that  its origin  is  Archaic.  An  open  space  bordered  by  public  build- ings  on  the  highest  point  of  the  plateau  is  interpreted  as  an agora  (Voza  in  Storia  della  Sicilia  i. 550,fig.  90).  The  main urban  area  in  the  south-western  part  of  the  city  was  on  a  grid plan  and  delimited  on  the  north  by  a  C 4m(?)  temenos  (the so-called  Asklepieion)  of  unknown  cult  (Orsi  et al.( 1966) 287\u00ad88,  320).  Sparse  remains  of  habitation  structures  in  the southernmost  part  of  the  area  are  of  C 8l\u00adC7e  date  and  reveal affinities w ith  contemporary  architecture  from  Megara  (no. 36)  and  Syracuse  (no. 47;  Voza  ( 1978),  ( 1980\u00ad81)  685\u00ad86).Yet another  temenos  marked  the  southern  limit  of  the  city:  a  C 4s temple  dedicated  to  Demeter  (Voza  ( 1973a)  118\u00ad19;  Hinz ( 1998)  116\u00ad18)  and  smaller  thesauroi/naiskoi. A  suburban  Demeter  sanctuary  spanning  the  Archaic  and the  Hellenistic  periods  was  located  near  the  coast  north  of Heloron  (Voza  ( 1973a)  123\u00ad26;  Storia  della  Sicilia  i. 548;  Hinz ( 1998)  111\u00ad16).  The  Hellenistic  programme  of  public  build- ing  included  a  small  C 4\u00adC2  theatre outside  the  southern perimeter  of  the  city  (Orsi  et al.( 1966)  232\u00ad35,  324\u00ad27; Mitens ( 1988)  89\u00ad91).  Hesychius  refers  to an  ' (s.v.)  celebrated  at  the  river  Heloros  and  possibly  to  be connected  with  the  city. 19. ", "Selinous": "Identifier: 47. , (Selinousios) Map  47.

Selinous  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Xen.  Hell. 1.1.37  and  is  listed  by  Ps.-Skylax  13  under  the  heading   ` ;  it  is  referred  to as  a  polis  in  the  political sense  at  Thuc. 6.20.2\u00ad3  and 6.48.1.A C 6l  legal  text  from Olympia  dealing  with  exiles  from  Megara  (no. 36;  IvO 22; IGDS  no. 28)  in  fr.  f. 3  refers  to [ ];according to Asheri ( 1979b),  the  inscription  records  a  treaty  between  the  polis  of Selinous  and  a  group  of  exiles  from  Megara;  however,  the fragmentary  state  of  the  inscription  does  not  allow  us  to 220 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo determine  whether  the  reference  is  to  Megara  or  to  Selinous. A  C 5m  lex  sacra  refers  to h   \u00b5  (A. 18)  and ~ \u00b5  ~   ~ \u00b5  (B. 10;  Jameson  et al.( 1993)). The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  on C 5m  coins  (infra)  and  in  IGDS  no. 78  (c. 450;  Arena  ( 1989) no. 53);  the  external  collective use  is  attested  in  Diod. 5.9.2 (rC 6f),  Hdt. 5.46.2,  Thuc. 6.20.4  and  Xen.  Hell. 1.2.10.The external  individual  use  is  found  in  IGDS  no. 67  (C 6l),  IG XII. 5  444.65.79b  (C 3f  (rC 5l)),  and  F.Delphes iii.1391.2 (c. 360). According  to  Thuc. 6.4.2,  Selinous  was  founded  100  years after  the  foundation  of  its  metropolis  Megara,  i.e.  c. 628/7. The  oecist  Pammilos  was  possibly  from  the  original  mother city,  Megara  Nisaia  (no. 225),although  the  text  is  ambiguous (cf.  HCT  ad  loc.  and  Casevitz  ( 1985)  105,  109  n. 27),  and  a Megara  Hyblaian  origin  cannot  be  excluded.  Diod. 13.59.4 supports  the  Eusebian  date  for  the  foundation  of  Selinous: 242  years  before  its  destruction  in  409/8,i.e.c.651/50  (source: B\u00e9rard  ( 1957)  244\u00ad46).  Diodorus'  date  is  consistent  with  the chronology  of  the  recently  excavated  Buffa  and  Manuzza cemeteries  (Tusa  ( 1982)  191\u00ad94;  Rallo  ( 1982)). Selinous  was  the  westernmost  Greek  colony  on  the  south coast  of  Sicily,  founded  on  the  confines of  Phoenician  and Elymian  territories.  The  size  of  Selinous'  territory  varied, and  borders  changed  (see  La  Geni\u00e8re  ( 1978)).  The  C 7l immediate  hinterland  may  have  comprised  300\u00ad400  km \u00b2.A sanctuary  of  Herakles  near  the  Hellenised  Elymian  settle- ment  at  Monte  Castellazzo  di  Poggioreale,  c. 30  km  north  of Selinous,  is  deduced  from  the  C 6e  dedication  to  Herakles  by one  Aristylos  in  the  Selinountian  alphabet  and  in  Doric dialect  (IGDS  no. 84;  Falsone  ( 1992)  307\u00ad8);  stone  quarries in  the  catchment  area  of  Selinous  served  the  early  building programmes  in  the  sanctuaries  of  the  colony  (Peschlow- Bindokat  ( 1990)).  With  the  foundation  of  Minoa  in  C 6f/m (infra)  the  area  within  Selinountian  influence may have encompassed  c. 1,200\u00ad1,800  km \u00b2,  and  there  is  clear  evidence of  Selinountine  architects  at  work  by  C 6  in  the  Contrada Mango  sanctuary  at  Segesta  (Tusa  ( 1961);  de  La  Geni\u00e8re ( 1978)).  The  original,  indigenous  settlement  of  Monte Adranone,  situated  on  the  western  border  of  Selinountine territory,  c. 30  km  north-west  of  Selinous,  resettled  by Selinountines  in  C 6m,  served  as  a  fortified outpost until C 5l (Fiorentini  ( 1995)).  The  site  is  perhaps  the  kome  Adranon mentioned  by  Diod.  ( 23.4.2)  in  connection  with  the  Punic wars,  not  to  be  confused  with  the  Adranon  (no. 6)  founded by  Dionysios. After  initial  peaceful  co-existence  (Tusa  ( 1983)  302\u00ad14; Zahrnt  ( 1993)  355\u00ad57),  a  long  history  of  conflicts w ith  the non-Greek  populations  can  be  traced:  an  alliance  of Selinous  and  a  colonising  expedition  led  by  Pentathlos  of Knidos  (c. 580\u00ad576)  was  defeated  by  the  Elymians  (Diod. 5.9.2\u00ad3),  and  conflicts between G reeks,  Elymians  and Phoenicians  are  also  reflected in the failed e xpedition  of Dorieus  in  510  (Hdt. 5.46.1),  if  not  already  by  the  C 6  inscrip- tion  commemorating  Aristogeiton,  who  fell  at  Motya  (IGDS no. 73;  Mafoda  ( 1995)).  In  480,  however,  Selinous  was  the only  Greek  city  of  Sicily  supporting  Carthage  against Theron  of  Akragas  and  Gelon  of  Syracuse  (Diod. 11.21.4\u00ad5, 13.55.1).  In  466,  Selinous  assisted  Syracuse  in  expelling  the tyrant  Thrasyboulos  (Diod. 11.68.1).  A  victory  of  uncertain date  is  mentioned  in  the  460\u00ad409  inscription  (IGDS  no. 78) from  temple  \"G\"  (infra)  revealing  conflicts c.C 5m  with Elymians  and/or  Phoenicians.  Not  all  relations  with  the non-Greek  populations  were  hostile,  however,  and  there may  have  been  epigamia  between  Selinous  and  Segesta (Thuc. 6.1.2  with  HCT). In 416  the  conflict w ith  Segesta  (supra)  led  Selinous  to  ally itself  with  Syracuse  (Thuc. 6.6.2),  and  accordingly  it  sup- ported  Syracuse  in  its  war  with  Athens  (Thuc. 6.65.1,  67.2, 7.58.1;  cf.  Diod. 13.4.2  (r 415)).  The  territorial  disputes between  Segesta  and  Selinous  in  416  (Thuc. 6.6.2;Diod. 12.82.3)  and  410  (Diod. 13.43.1\u00ad4)  ultimately  led  to  the destruction  of  Selinous  in  409  by  Carthage  (Diod. 13.55\u00ad57), when  the  houses  were burnt  or  torn down, 16,000  were killed, 5,000  taken  prisoners,  and  2,600  escaped  to Akragas (no. 9;Diod.  13.57.6\u00ad58.3).  The  city  was  recaptured  and  for- tified b y  Hermokrates,  who  also  laid  waste  the  territories  of Motya  and  Panormos  (Diod. 13.62.3\u00ad5  (r 409)).  As  an  out- come  of  adversities  suffered  by  the  Carthaginians,  Himilcar was  forced  to  sign  a  peace  treaty  with  Dionysios  I  in  405,in which,  however,  it  was  stipulated  that  Selinous  (and  several other  cities)  were  to  be  unfortified and pay t ribute  to Carthage  (Diod. 13.114.1;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge  no. 210).Yet  conflicts between  the  Greek  cities  and  Carthage  continued,  and Dionysios,  with  Selinous  and  Himera  (no. 24),  attacked Motya  in  397  (Diod. 14.47.7),  which  implies  that,  in  addition to  the  eastern  Sicilian  cities,  Himera  and  Selinous  had  also come  within  Dionysios'  hegemony.  A  second  peace  treaty  of 392  was  in  most  matters  similar  to  that  of 405  (Diod. 14.96.3; Staatsvertr\u00e4ge  no. 233).It  seems,  however,  that  Selinous  (and the  other  cities  subjected  to  Carthage  by  the  previous  treaty) were  now  handed  over  to  Dionysios  I  (see  Stylianou  ( 1998) 207).  In  a  peace  treaty  of  c. 374  Selinous,  its  territory,  and Akragas  were  again  ceded  to  the  Carthaginians  (Diod. 15.17.5 with  Stylianou  ( 1998)  ad  loc.;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge  no. 261). Selinous  was  recaptured  by  Dionysios  in  368,but an sikelia  221 armistice  was  agreed  and  the  old  borders  were  re- established  (Diod. 15.73.2\u00ad4),  and  when  Dion  visited Herakleia  Minoa  (west  of  Selinous)  in  357,  this  city  was  con- trolled  by  Carthage  (Diod  16.9.4).  In  the  339  treaty  between Timoleon  and  Carthage,  Selinous  was  left  within  the Carthaginian  sphere  of interest  (Diod. 16.82.3; Staatsvertr\u00e4ge  no. 344;  cf.  Talbert  ( 1974)  83\u00ad85),  and  this  was confirmed b y  the  treaty  between  Agathokles  and  Carthage in 314  (Diod. 19.71.7). A  few  scattered  sources  shed  some  light  on  the  military strength  of  Selinous  and  the  size  of  its  population.  A  contin- gent  of  hoplites  from  Selinous  fought  alongside  the Syracusans  in  415  (Thuc. 6.67.2);  later,  Selinountine  psiloi and  hippeis  marched  to  Syracuse  under  the  command  of Gylippos  (Thuc. 7.1.3\u00ad5;  cf.  Diod. 13.4.7  (r 414));  hippeis  are mentioned  also  in  Diod. 11.21.4  (r 480).  A  navy  is  implied  by Thucydides'  reference  to two  nees  ...Selinountiai  at 8.26.1 (cf.  Xen.  Hell. 1.2.8  for  another  two).  In reference  to 410, Diod. 13.44.3  describes  Selinous  as  a  polis  polyandrousa,  and a  hint  of  the  C 5l  size  of  population  is  found  in  the  figures of 16,000  inhabitants  killed  and  5,000  captives  taken  by  the Carthaginians  in  409  (Diod. 13.57.6);  this  had  already  been preceded  by  the  loss  of 1,000  men  in  an  ambush  (Diod. 13.44.4  (r 410)).  Even  so, 2,600  escaped  to Akragas  (Diod. 13.58.3).  A  full  mobilisation  of  forces  is  mentioned  in  Diod. 14.47.7  (r 397). Diplomatic  activities  include  the  reception  of  envoys (Diod. 11.68.1  (r 466))  as  well  as  the  sending  of  envoys  (Diod. 11.21.4  (r 480),  bibliaphoroi,  cf. 13.54.3  (r 409),  13.43.7,  44.4 (r 409)).  F.Delphes iii.1391  (c. 360\u00ad355)  is  a  grant  of  various privileges  by  Delphi  (no. 177)  to  a  man  of  Selinous.  A  grant of  politeia  to  Selinountians  by  Ephesos  (no. 844)  is  recorded by Xen.  Hell. 1.2.10;it  was  prompted  by  the  destruction  of  the city. What  we  know  about  the  constitution  indicates  that Selinous  was  mostly  governed  by  tyrants,  at  least  in  the  Archaic  period.  Tyranny  is  attested  in  connection  with the  C 6l  expedition  of  Dorieus,  whose  Euryleon liberated  the  Selinountians  from  the  mounarchos Pythagoras  but  went  on  to assume  monarchical  power  him- self  (Hdt. 5.46.2;  cf.  Luraghi  ( 1994)  54\u00ad55;  Mafoda  ( 1995)). An  earlier  tyranny  at  Selinous  (C 6m  or  C 6f)  may  be  sug- gested  by the  anecdote  of  \"Theron,  son  of  Miltiades\"  assum- ing  tyrannical  power  by  a  stratagem  (Polyaen. 1.28.2;  full discussion:  Luraghi  ( 1994)  52\u00ad54).  The  \u00b5  of  IvO 22  (IGDS  no. 28  (C 6l))  refers  to  a  magistracy  attested  also  in Megara  Nisaia  (no. 225)  and  other  Megarian  colonies (Dubois  ad  IGDS  no. 28  fr.b. 5\u00ad6  with  refs.);  however,  the context  does  not  make  clear  whether  the  reference  is  to Selinous  or  to  Megara  (for  the  office in general,  see  Asheri ( 1979b)  490).  The  text  may  mention  a  halia:h ] [  (see  Arena  ( 1989)  no. 52  fr.  h. 4;  Asheri  ( 1979b)). Whether  this  Selinountine(?)  halia  should  be  interpreted  as an  ekklesia  or  a  special  court  is  uncertain;  Asheri  opts  for  an ad  hoc  tribunal  (Asheri  ( 1979b)  490).  Two  C 5  public  enact- ments  are  preserved:  a  lex  sacra  of  C 5m  (Jameson  et al. ( 1993))  and  IGDS  no. 78  IG xiv  268  (C 5m/s),  which  lists Selinountine  divinities  and  incorporates  a  decree.  A metoikos  at  Selinous  is  mentioned  by  Callim.  fr. 201 (Pfeiffer)  Dieg. ix.15\u00ad16  (referring  to  the  period  before Timaios  wrote,  cf.  FGrHist 566,fr.  148).  A  C 6\u00adC5  dedicatory inscription  attests  the  existence  of  a  whose  mem- bers  are  given  as  two  groups  of  women  (Lazzarini  no. 880e; cf.  Jameson  et al.( 1993)  90);  it  is  not  clear  whether  this  was  a public  or  a  private  institution. A  C 5f  dedication  by  the  citizens  of  Selinous  and  the metopes  of  Temple  C  testify  to  the  Selinountian  pantheon  in which  the  principal  divinity  seems  to  be  Zeus  (IG xiv  268; SEG 38  960;  SEG 43  628;  IGDS  no. 78;  see  also  Jameson  et al. ( 1993)). Selinous  had  a  thesauros  at  Olympia  (Paus. 6.19.11  (rC 5)). The  foundation  of  the  building  has  with  some  probability been  identified,  and  C 5e  architectural  terracottas  have  with some  uncertainty  been  associated  with  it  (Mertens-Horn and  Viola  ( 1990)  240). The  town  of  Selinous  was  founded  on  a  vast  plateau, c. 1.3  km  long,  oriented  roughly  north\u00adsouth  between  the ancient  river  Selinous,  from  which  the  city  took  its  name (Douris  (FGrHist 76)  fr. 59),  to  the  west,  and  the  river Cotone  to  the  east.  The  site  comprises  three  hills  separated by  the  river  valleys,  the  city  occupying  the  central  plateau, while  the  two  lateral  plateaux,  the  Gaggera  to  the  west  and the  Marinella  to  the  east,  were  dedicated  to  sanctuaries (Martin  et al.( 1979)  637\u00ad53;  cf.  Parisi  Presicce  ( 1984)  fig. 2 and 127\u00ad32  for  topographical  surveys).  The  southern plateau,  facing  the  coast  and  often  regarded  as  the  acropolis of  the  city,  owes  its  acropolis-like  appearance  to  an  artificial accentuation  of  the  morphology  of  the  site  due  to  C 4l  and C 3l  defensive  structures  (Di  Vita  ( 1980)). C 7m/s  habitation  remains  on  the  northern,  Manuzza plateau  (Rallo  ( 1976\u00ad1977),  ( 1984))  and  on  the  \"acropolis\" (Fourmont  ( 1984\u00ad85))  have  revealed  an  overall  coherence  in the  urbanisation  of  the  two  areas.  Unusually,  a  cemetery  is situated  within  the  urban  area  on  the  Manuzza.  A  large  part of  the  \"acropolis\"  was  laid  out  as  a  temenos  from  C 7.  There  is also  coherence  between  the  three  major  plateaux  of  the  site 222 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo from  C 7:  the  Manuzza  plateau  and  \"acropolis\",  the  Marinella plateau  east  of  the  river  Hypsas  with  a  C 7  shrine  (Gullini ( 1993)),  and  the  Gaggera  plateau  west  of  the  river  Selinous with  the  Malophoros  sanctuary  and  the  C 7l  megaron (Romeo  ( 1989)  40,no.  64).  The  main  east\u00adwest  axis  on  the \"acropolis\"joined  the  estuaries  of  the  two  rivers  and  the  har- bours  of  Selinous,  the  eastern  harbour  possibly  military,  the western  harbour  possibly  commercial. In  the  second  urban  phase,  from  c.C 6e,  the  habitation area  and  urban  layout  encompassed  also  the  east  and  west slopes  of  the  central  plateau  with  parts  of  the  confining val- leys  (de  La  Geni\u00e8re  and  Rougetet  ( 1985);  Mertens  ( 1999) 188\u00ad90).  Habitation  on  the  northernmost  part  of  the Manuzza  plateau  was  laid  out  on  a  different  orientation  to that  employed  on  the  \"acropolis\"  and  on  the  southern  part of  Manuzza  plateau,  and  an  agora  at  the  junction  of  these separate  urban  districts  is  similar  to  the  location  of  the  agora at  Megara  (Mertens  ( 1999)  190\u00ad93).  Rallo  ( 1976\u00ad77)  731  has suggested  that  the  differences  in  orientation  could  reflect different  populations,  and  a  Corinthian  ethnic  group  has been  deduced  from  epigraphic  and  tomb  evidence  (cf.  de  La Geni\u00e8re  ( 1977)  257;  IGDS  nos. 72  and 79).  The  C 6\u00adC5  urban area  comprised  about  100  ha  (Mertens  ( 1989)  fig. 4,(1999) fig.  on  p. 188). A  theatre,  possibly  serving  as  the  meeting  place  for  the assembly,  is  mentioned  in  Callim.  fr. 201,  Pfeiffer,  Dieg. ix.22\u00ad23  (referring  to  the  period  before  Timaios  wrote,  cf. FGrHist 566,fr.  148). So  far  none  of  the  defensive  walls  of  the  \"acropolis\"  can  be dated  earlier  than  the  C 5l  Hermokratean  structures  of 409, when  the  Syracusan  exiles  seized  Selinous  for  a  short  period in  connection  with  the  Carthaginian  war  (Diod. 13.63.3\u00ad4; ibid. 185\u00ad86).  By  contrast,  the  outer  circuit  wall  and  gates  in the  Hypsas  valley,  marking  the  eastern  limit  of  the  city,  are  of C 6f  and  C 5e  (Mertens  ( 1989)  138\u00ad39).  A  circuit  wall  across the  Manuzza  plain  was  probably  raised  by  Hermokrates  in 409  (ibid. 139\u00ad43).  The  sophisticated  fortification and g ate system  on  the  north  side  of  the  acropolis,  comparable  with the  Euryalos  fortification at S yracuse,  may  in  its  final phase be  the  work  of  Agathokles  during  his  short  occupation  of Selinous  in  307  (Diod. 20.56.3;  cf.  Lawrence  ( 1979)  295; Mertens  ( 1989)  110\u00ad31,  151). The  central  and  south-eastern  part  of  the  \"acropolis\"  was from  early  on  occupied  by  at  least  two  temene  (Gabrici ( 1929));  the  south  temenos  with  two  parallel  temples  of  C 5f, \"O\"  and  \"A\"  (divinities  unknown).  The  central  temenos  has traces  of  simple  C 7l\u00adC6e  naiskoi.  There  is  no  structural evidence  for  a  major  C 6  peripteral  temple,  but  architectural terracottas  are  taken  as  evidence  for  one.  As part  of  the  C 6f regular  urban  plan,  the  sanctuary  was  enclosed  by  peribolos walls  from  580  to 560  (\u00d8stby  ( 1995)).A  large  artificial t errace supported  by  a  huge,  stepped  retaining  wall  of  ashlar masonry  on  the  east  slope  of  the  acropolis,  dated  prior  to C 6m,  permitted  an  enlargement  of  the  temenos  and  the erection  of  new  buildings:  temple  \"C\"  (date  controversial: before  C 6m  or  c. 530\u00ad520)  replaced  the  earlier,  conjectural temple,  with  an  altar  to  the  east  and  a  monumental  stoa  on top  of  the  retaining  wall  marking  the  east  side  of  the  temenos (Di  Vita  ( 1967),  ( 1984)).  Architectural  fragments  and  sculp- ture  reused  in  the  later  fortifications are from an otherwise unknown  sanctuary,  possibly  near  the  agora  (Mertens ( 1999)).  The  temenos  was  enlarged  in  C 5e  to make  room  for the  monumental  temple  \"D\". On  the  basis  of  epigraphic  evidence,  above  all  the  inscrip- tion  (IGDS  no. 78)  from  temple  \"G\"  (infra),  temple  \"C\",  with its  predecessor,  is  attributed  to  Apollo  (Bejor  ( 1977)  449; IGDS  no. 51).  The  dedicatees  of  the  c. 480\u00ad450  temples  \"A\", \"O\"  and  \"D\"  are  more  uncertain.  Three  monumental  tem- ples,  \"E\",  \"F\"  and  \"G\",  were  aligned  on  the  Marinella  hill  east of  the  Hypsas  valley  (Berve  and  Gruben  ( 1963)  426\u00ad32; Gullini  ( 1993)).  Temple  \"G\"  (C 6l,  not  completed)  is  among the  most  monumental  of  antiquity;  the  inscription  from  the adyton  mentions  a  victory,  a  number  of  divinities,  and  a dedication  to  these  in  gold  to  the  value  of 60  tal.  put  up      (Calder  ( 1963),  ( 1964);  IGDS  no. 78).  The occasion  of  the  victory  is  unknown,  but  historical  and  epi- graphical  evidence  dates  the  inscription  between  460  and 409  (Calder  ( 1963)  54\u00ad62).The  temple  is  often  interpreted  as the  Apolloneion  mentioned  in  the  inscription,  but  the  evid- ence  is  inconclusive,  and  the  identification of  the  temple  as an  Olympieion  has  won  support  (Tusa  ( 1967);  Bejor  ( 1977); infra).  The  cult  of  the  C 6m  temple  \"F\"  is  unknown,  but  the closed  peristasis  may  indicate  a  mystery  cult,  e.g.  of  Dionysos or  Demeter.  Temple  \"E\",  of  C 7l\u00adC5m,  has  been  identified as a  Heraion  (IGDS  no. 56). At  least  four  sanctuaries  were  located  on  the  Gaggera  hill west  of  the  river  Selinous  (Gabrici  ( 1927);  Tusa  et al. ( 1984\u00ad85)  574\u00ad81).  The  major  sanctuary  of  Demeter Malophoros  (IGDS  no. 54),  located  near  the  coast  and  har- bour,  had  an  initial  phase  in  C 7l\u00adC6e  and  a  monumental aspect  established  by C 6s  with  a  temple,  a  monumental  altar and  a  peribolos  wall,  later  embellished  with  a  C 5l  propylon. The  votive  material  is  immensely  rich  (Gabrici  ( 1927); recent  surveys:  Dewailly  ( 1992)  1\u00ad36  and  Hinz  ( 1998) 144\u00ad52).  The  cult  of  the  adjacent  C 6m  temenos  was  that  of Hekate  (IGDS  no. 55).  To  the  north,  a  sanctuary  of  Zeus sikelia  223 Meilichios  bordered  on  that  of  Demeter  (Gabrici  ( 1927) 91\u00ad107;  Tusa  ( 1977)),  with  a  cult  that  is  characterised  by  a number  of  C 6s\u00adC5  crude  and  simple  stone  stelai  carrying votive  inscriptions  (earliest  C 6m:  IGDS  nos. 45,  50;  Jameson et al.( 1993)  89\u00ad107,  132\u00ad36)  and  by  later  defixiones  (IGDS nos. 35,  39,  40).  To  the  south,  a  peribolos  wall,  parallel  to that of  the  Demeter  sanctuary,  enclosed  yet  another  temenos  and temple  of  uncertain  cult  (Parisi  Presicce  ( 1984)  21\u00ad24).  A  C 6 temple  \"M\"  marks  the  north  end  of  the  row  of  sanctuaries (Sguaitammati  ( 1993)). The  inscription  from  temple  \"G\"  (IGDS  no. 78)  mentions Zeus,  Phobos,  Herakles,  Apollo,  Poseidon,  the  Tyndaridai, Athena, (Demeter)  Malophoros  and  Pasikrateia (Persephone?).  The  second  part  of  the  dedication,  the decree,  mentions  an  Apolloneion  and  Zeus  (Calder  ( 1963); IGDS  no. 78).  A  cult  of  Zeus  Agoraios  is  revealed  by  the episode  of  Euryleon  seeking  refuge  at  the  altar  of  Zeus Agoraios  (Hdt. 5.46.2).  Coin  types  suggest  cults  of  Artemis and  Apollo,  and  the  river-gods  Selinous  and  Hypsas. The  earliest  cemetery  is  the  one  situated  in  the  south-east of  the  Manuzza  plateau  dating  from  before  C 7m  and  in  use throughout  C 7,  the  early  material  reflecting the M egarian origin  of  Selinous  (Rallo  ( 1982)).  Contemporaneously  and in  subsequent  periods  cemeteries  were  laid  out  on  the  hills surrounding  the  urban  site:  C 7m  on  the  Buffa  hills  north- east  of  the  Manuzza  plateau  (Tusa  ( 1982)  196\u00ad202);  C 6e  and C 5,  mainly  inhumation  tombs,  some  cremation  and  a  few child  enchytrismos  burials  on  the  Gaggera  hills  west  of  the Manuzza  plateau,  and  C 7s  tombs  on  the  Galera  hills  north  of the  Manuzza  plateau  (Vallet  and  Villard  ( 1958)). Selinous  was  one  of  the  first S icilian  cities  to  issue  coins, c. 540\u00ad530:  staters  probably  initially  on  the  Corinthian standard  but  at  the  end  of  the  Archaic  phase  on  the  Attic. Types:  obv.  celery  leaf  ( );rev.patterned punch-mark in  incuse  square  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 591\u00ad93;  SNG  Cop.  Suppl. 73).Later  issues  have  rev.  celery  leaf  in  incuse  square,  legend: with  variations  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 594).  Three  smaller fractions  carry rev.  celery  leaf,  or  flower,  or  pellets  (Cutroni Tusa  ( 1975);  C.  Boehringer  ( 1984\u00ad85)  116\u00ad19;  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 595\u00ad96).  A  unique  drachm  carries  the  unabbreviated  city-ethnic  as  legend  (Cutroni  Tusa  ( 1988\u00ad89)  370\u00ad71). Confirmation of  Corinthian  influence on early S icilian coinage  and  imports  of  bullion  from  the  Aegean  area  is given  by  a  C 6l  coin  and  bullion  hoard  found  near  Selinous (ibid.  ( 1988\u00ad89)  397\u00ad98).  Minting  of  Syracuse-inspired tetradrachms  began  c. 450:  obv.  sacred  chariot  with  Apollo and  Artemis,  legend:  ;  rev.  naked  youth, the  river-god  Selinous,  offering  a  libation  at  an  altar  in  a sanctuary,  l.  below  cock,  on  r.  celery  leaf  and  statue  of  bull, legend: (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 597).  The  types  of  the lower  denomination  (didrachms)  are:  obv.  Herakles  fight- ing  Cretan  bull,  legend: ;  rev.river-god Hypsas,  legend: (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 601);  on  smaller denominations,  obv.  nymph  seated  on  rock  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 602\u00ad3).  The  issues  continue  with  variants  until  409  (SNG Cop.  Sicily 604\u00ad6).  Bronze  coinage  was  issued  at  least  from c. 420  (Price  ( 1979);  Rutter  ( 1997)  142);  however,  an  issue  of cast  coins  may  go  back  to  450\u00ad440  (Cutroni  Tusa  ( 1997\u00ad98) 646\u00ad47). Selinous  founded  the  colony  of  (Herakleia)  Minoa  (no. 20)  (Hdt. 5.46.2)  on  the  estuary  of  the  river  Platani  c.C 6f/m to  secure  its  eastern  territory  against  Akragantine  expan- sion,  but  after  the  short-lived  rule  of  Euryleon,  the  colony was  taken  by  Akragas  (no. 9);  during  Theron's reign ( 488\u00ad473)  it  seems  to  have  been  a  city  within  Akragantine dominion,  possibly  after  conquest  by Theron  (cf.  Diod. 4.79.4  with  Fontana  ( 1978);  see  further  Herakleia  (no. 20)). 45.  (Sileraioi) Map 47.  Unlocated  (cf.  Manni  ( 1981)  225).

Size of  territory:  ? Type:  C: . The  Stielanaioi  struck  coins  from  c. 460  onwards;  they may  have  been  based  at  the  of  Steph.  Byz. 588.7, but  see  Manni  ( 1974)  64  and  ( 1981)  227,  who  points  out  that a  form  such  as  * is  to  be  expected  on  the  basis  of the  ethnic  Stielanaios.The  Stielanaioi  are  included  here  on account  of  their  Greek-style  coinage:  this  coinage  began with  an  issue  of  silver  litrai  c. 460:  obv.  forepart  of  man-head- ed  bull,  legend: () (retrograde);  rev. male  figure (river-god?) sacrificing  at  altar.  Later  issues (drachms  and  lower  denominations):  obv.  male  head  laure- ate  (river-god  or,  perhaps  more  likely,  Apollo);  rev.  forepart of  man-headed  bull,  legend: (Head,  HN \u00b2171; Bernab\u00f2  Brea  ( 1975)  49\u00ad51;  Holloway  ( 1975)  142\u00ad43; Manganaro  ( 1984)  35\u00ad36;  survey  of  find-places:  Cutroni Tusa  ( 1997\u00ad98)  630;  cf.  AIIN 42  ( 1995)  pl. 26,fig.2).The t ypes reveal  strong  influence from the c ontemporary  mints  of Katane  and  Leontinoi.  The  Stielanaioi  are  considered  a Greek  community  by  Mirone  ( 1928),  followed  by  Ziegler 224 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo ( 1940),founded  C 5e  in  the  hinterland  of  Katane  (no. 30)  and Leontinoi  (no. 33)  in  the  aftermath  of  the  Deinomenid aggression  against  these  cities. 47. ", "Lipara": "Identifier: 36. , (Liparaios) Map  47.  Lat. 38.30  long. 14.55.  Size of  territory: 2  (  size  of  island).  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is ,  (SEG 37  414  (C 5f));  Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 1; Thuc. 3.88.2;  cf. in  Polyb. 34.11.19,  where  the  plural \"die  Stadt  Lipara  [i.e.  in  contradistinction  to  the  island]  zu bezeichnen  scheint,  da  Polyb.  sonst  sagt\"(Ziegler in RE  xiii. 719;  cf.,  however,  Diod. 5.7.1  claiming  homonymity between  island  and  polis); is  said  by later sources  to  have  been  an  earlier  name  of (Callim. Hymn. 3.47;Strabo 6.2.10).  The  city-ethnic  is   (C 5s  coins,  infra;  Thuc. 3.88.2),  although  (  ) seems to have been used as well (SEG  37  414 (C 5f)). Lipara  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Antiochos (FGrHist 555)  fr. 1  Paus. 10.11.3  (r  time  of  foundation)  and Arist.  Mete. 367a6.  In  later  sources  Lipara  is  called  a  polis  in the  political  sense  at  Polyb. 1.21.5  and  in  the  urban  sense  at Diod. 14.56.2  (r 396).  The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  by  C 5s  coins  (infra)  and  the  external collective use  in  Thuc. 3.88.2,Arist.  Mete. 367a6  and  presum- ably  on  the  C 5f  Liparan  dedication  at  Delphi  (Syll. \u00b314 (C 6l\u00adC5e)  SEG 34  405,  37  414;  cf.  BTCGI 9:  101ff).  The individual  use  of  the  ethnic  is  found  in  F.Delphes iii.4401 ( 315)  and  IG ii\u00b2  9214  (C 3e). Mythology  told  of  a  settlement  of  the  island  by  Liparos (Diod. 5.7.5),  who  founded  the  polis  and  was  joined  by Aiolos  (ibid.  and  4.67.4;  cf.  Hom.  Od. 10.1).  The  historical community  was  founded  by  apoikoi  from  Knidos  (no. 903; Thuc. 3.88.2;  Antiochos  (FrGHist 555)  fr. 1;Strabo 6.2.10;  cf. Hornblower ( 1991)  496).  However,  according  to Diod. 5.9.2\u00ad5,  the  foundation  was  the  outcome  of  a  joint  Knidian- Rhodian  expedition  to  western  Sicily  under  the  leadership of  Pentathlos  of  Knidos,  in  the  fiftieth Olympiad,  i.e. 580\u00ad576.  Pentathlos  was  killed  in  war  supporting  Selinous (no. 44)  against  Segesta,  and  the  leadership  of  the  group  was taken  over  by  Gorgos,  Thestor  and  Epithersides;  the  expedi- tion  found  at  Lipara  500  indigenous  inhabitants  of  Aiolos' line  whom  they  joined.  Antiochos  of  Syracuse  (FGrHist 555, fr. 1  as  preserved  in  Paus. 10.11.3),  while  agreeing  on  the  lead- ership  of  Pentathlos,  differs  inter  alia  from  Diodorus' account  in  naming  only  Knidians  as  colonisers  (as  does Thuc. 3.88.2),  and  in  stating  that  before  settling  at  Lipara  the expedition  had  founded  a  polis  at  Cape  Lilybaion  (Pritchett ( 1999)  98\u00ad100),  from  which  they  were  expelled  by  Elymians and  Phoenicians.  For  the  role  of  Knidians  in  the  venture,  see also  the  C 5f  Delphic  dedicatory  inscription: [  ]    (F.Delphes ii.1142;  LSAG 351  n. 1;  Syll. \u00b314;  SEG 37  414;  Bernab\u00f2  Brea  and  Cavalier  ( 1991)  102\u00ad3).  According to  the  Eusebian  chronology,  the  foundation  took  place  in 630/29,  but  Diodorus'  date  is  supported  by the  chronology of  the  votive  material  from  the  urban  sanctuary  and  by mortuary  evidence  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea  and  Cavalier  ( 1991)  137, 150). Lipara  was  the  centre  of  habitation  among  the  Aiolian Islands  (Thuc. 3.88.2:  '   \u00b5    \u00b5,    ),  of  which  there  were  seven in  all  (Diod. 5.7.1;Strabo 6.2.10),  known  also  as      (ibid.  and  1.3.10;Polyb.  1.25.4;Diod. 12.54.4,  14.103.2,  cf.  Syll. \u00b314).  Lipara  itself,  measuring  37.5 km \u00b2,is  fertile  (cf. at Diod.5.10.3and at  Strabo  6.2.10),  and  there  is  sporadic  evidence  of  single farmsteads  and  agricultural  activity  from  C 6.However,the area  exploited  for  agricultural  purposes  was  not  limited  to Lipara  but  included  the  other  islands  (Thuc. 3.88.2;Diod. 5.9.4\u00ad5);  Diodorus  gives  a  detailed  account  of  the  socio-eco- nomic  development  of  the  community,  referring  inter  alia to  such  institutions  as  syssitia,  absence  of  private  property and  close  community  control  of  the  agricultural  areas which  were publicly  owned  (ibid.  without  source reference). In 427/6  the  Liparaians  were  symmachoi  of  Syracuse  (no. 47),  and  in  that  year  the  Athenians  and  Rhegians  ravaged their  territory  (Thuc. 3.88.1\u00ad4;Diod.  12.54.4).  According  to Diod. 5.9.4,  the  community  maintained  a  fleet which was manned  by  a  group  of  citizens  devoting  themselves  speci- fically t o  that  duty,  while  the  rest  were  occupied  with  agri- culture.  The  existence  of  a  fleet may also be inferred from the repeated  defeats  of  Etruscan  forces  (infra).  A  strategos  is attested  in  393  (Diod. 14.93.4).  The  Liparaians  fought  sever- al  wars  against  the  Etruscans,  at  least  until  the  battle  of  Kyme ( 474),  and  they  won  several  victories  which  were  commem- orated  by  monuments  at  Delphi  (Diod. 5.9.5;Strabo 6.2.10; Paus. 10.11.3;  cf.  Rota  ( 1973)  and  Colonna  ( 1984)),  dedica- tions  that  may  be  taken  as  evidence  of  extreme  wealth  on  the island  (Paus. 10.16.7).  At the  time  of  Hieron,  but  before  474, the  Etruscans  besieged  and  captured  Lipara  (Callim.  fr. 93, Pfeiffer;  Tzetz.  Chil. 8.889\u00ad92).  In  396  Himilkon  occupied the  polis  of  Lipara  and  exacted  30  tal.  from  the  inhabitants (Diod. 14.56.2).  In  393  ( 396  according  to  Roman  chronolo- gy)  the  Liparaian  strategos  Timositheos  liberated  Roman ambassadors  taken  prisoner  by Liparaian  pirates  while  on sikelia  211 their  way  to  Delphi;  for  this  service  the  Romans  conferred on  Timositheos  the  right  of  public  hospitality  (Diod. 14.93). Lipara's  relations  with  Delphi  seem  to  have  been  close: consultation  of  the  oracle  in  the  face  of  the  Etruscan  threat is  attested  by  Paus. 10.16.7;  in  C 5\u00adC4  the  city  put  up  votives and  dedicated  booty  taken  from  the  Etruscans  (Diod. 5.9.5; Paus. 10.11.3,  16.75;  cf.  Syll. \u00b314;  Rota  ( 1973)  and  Colonna ( 1984));  a  Delphic  grant  of  proxeny  to two  Liparaians  is recorded in F.Delphes iii.4401  ( 315),  and  Lipara  was  among the  cities  visited  by  the  theoroi  of  Delphi  in  C 3s  (Manganaro ( 1964a);  SEG 22  455,  col. 4.117). The  city  was  founded  on  a  promontory  c. 65  m  above  sea level;  the  \"acropolis\"  of  the  city  (a  modern  designation) comprised  habitation,  but  there  was  also  a  lower  city  on  the western  slope  of  the  \"acropolis\".  The  site  had  two  harbours, probably  north  and  south  of  the  promontory  (Diod. 5.10.1). The  circuit  wall  built  in  a  polygonal  technique  and  raised c. 500  enclosed  the  acropolis  and  part  of  the  lower  city;  how- ever,  the  exact  course  is  not  wholly  clarified (Bernab\u00f2 B rea ( 1987)  20).  In  C 4f  the  perimeter  of  the  circuit  wall  was enlarged  to  incorporate  the  C 4  expansion  of  the  lower  city; the  new  wall  was  built  in  ashlar,  isodomic  technique  as  a double  curtain-wall  with  internal  fill, 3.80  m  wide,  strength- ened  with  towers  (ibid. 20\u00ad23).The  most  extensive  cemetery with  c. 2,000  tombs  lay  to  the  north  of  the  city  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea and  Cavalier  ( 1991)  146\u00ad54). No  Greek  remains  of  habitation  from  the  Archaic  and Classical  periods  are  extant,  but  early  Greek  presence  is  evi- denced  by  votive  deposits.  The  only  known  public  building is  the  C 4  prytaneion  (Diod. 20.101.2  (r 304)).  Votive  deposits testify  to  sanctuaries  within  the  urban  area  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea and  Cavalier  ( 1977)  89\u00ad91).  Further  votive  deposits  delimit- ed  by  primitive  peribolos  walls  indicate  simple  temene. Sporadic  finds of  architectural  terracottas  testify  to  a  temple or  naiskos  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea  and  Cavalier  ( 1991)  139).  There  is evidence  of  suburban  sanctuaries,  one  probably  dedicated to  Demeter  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea  and  Cavalier  ( 1977)  133\u00ad35;(1991) 158\u00ad59). A  C 6m  inscription  restored  [] (Bernab\u00f2 Brea and  Cavalier  ( 1977)  90)  may  testify  to  a  cult  of  this  mythical figure (cf.  Diod. 20.101.2  (r 304)  for  dedications  allegedly  set up  by  Aiolos  and  kept  in  the  prytaneion).  A  cult  of Hephaistos  is  adduced  from  C 5s  coins,  easily  explained  in the  light  of  volcanic  activity  on  the  Lipari  islands.  Coins  also testify  to  a  cult  of  Apollo.  A  C 4\u00adC3  dedication  probably attests  to  a  cult  of  Artemis  (Manganaro  ( 1979);Bernab\u00f2  Brea and  Cavalier  ( 1991)  90,158),and  there  is  epigraphic  evidence for  a  cult  of  Aphrodite  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea  and  Cavalier  ( 1991)  90; cf. 168  for  refs.  to  iconographic  testimonies).  A  cult  of Dionysos  is  sometimes  inferred  from  the  abundant  New Comedy  terracottas  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea  and  Cavalier  ( 1991) 161\u00ad62). Lipara  struck  a  bronze  coinage  based  upon  the  litra from C 5s  (survey  in  Bernab\u00f2  Brea  and  Cavalier  ( 1991)  109\u00ad21). The  obv.  depicts  a  male  head  with  helmet  or,  more  likely,  a pilos  and  therefore  Hephaistos;  rev.  ship's  stern;  legend: ;  lower  denominations  lack  the  stern  (SNG Cop.  Sicily 1084\u00ad85).  A  rare  issue  of  Lipara  and  Mytistratos with  the  legends  and suggests  some  agreement  or understanding  between  the  two  cities,  but  the  nature  of  this is  uncertain  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea  and  Cavalier  ( 1991)  112\u00ad13).  A second  issue,  probably  of  C 4  rather  than  C 5l,  based  on  the litra but  of  reduced  weight,  with  lower  denominations,  has obv.  young,  naked  seated  Hephaistos  holding  hammer  and kantharos;  rev.  dolphin,  among  variants:  head  of  Apollo(?), rev.  legend: (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 1088\u00ad96;for the  date,  see  Bernab\u00f2  Brea  and  Cavalier  ( 1991)  117\u00ad18). Another  C 4  issue  may  indicate  cultural  and  political  kinship with  Taras  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea  and  Cavalier  ( 1991)  114). 35.  *Longane  (Longenaios) Map  47.  Lat. 38.05,long. 15.10.

Byz. 418.19,  who  gives  the  corresponding  ethnic  as ;  Steph.  cites  Philistos  (  FGrHist 556,fr.  38), but  for  which  detail  is  unclear.  The  city-ethnic  is in  IG xiv  319  (  IGDS  no. 200;  cf.  Hornbostel and  Hornbostel  ( 1988)  234),  a  C 5m  kerykeion  inscribed    \u00b5 \u00b5();  it  is  on  C 5l  coins (infra). On  the  basis  of  Polyb. 1.9.7,  Longane  is  located  near  Mylai (no. 38),  and  the  river  Longane  (ibid.)  may  be  the  river Loitanos  of  Diod. 22.23.  The  city  has  been  tentatively  ident- ified w ith  the  considerable  remains  of  a  settlement  on Monte  Ciappa,  above  modern  Rodi  and  Milici,  where  C 5 evidence  of  Hellenisation  is  found  in  the  form  of  ashlar technique  in  the  circuit  wall,  a  rectangular  building  complex outside  the  walls  (perhaps  a  sanctuary),  and,  finally,  mort- uary  evidence  (Ryolo  di  Maria  ( 1950\u00ad51);  Massa  ( 1991); Bernab\u00f2  Brea  and  Carettoni  ( 2000)).  However,  other  sites with  urban  remains  have  been  put  forward  as  candidates  for the  site  (Wilson  ( 1988)  125). No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Longane  a  polis,but the  kerykeion  (supra)  and  the  Greek-style  coins  (infra)  sug- gest  that  it  was  a  polis  and  suggest  Hellenisation  as  well. 212 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo Longane  minted  bronze  litrai  from  C 5l,  a  date  suggested by  the  similarity  with  Geloan  coins  of  c. 415\u00ad405:  obv. Herakles  wearing  lion  skin,  legend: ;  rev. personification of  river-god,  Longanos  (Jenkins  ( 1975) 99\u00ad101;  Massa  ( 1991)  250\u00ad51).  (Manganaro  ( 1984)  36\u00ad37 argues  for  a  c.C 4m  date  for  this  coinage  and  therefore  reads the  legend  not  as  an  ethnic  but  as  an  adjective.)  If  Longane  is correctly  located  inland  somewhere  between  Milazzo  and Tyndaris  (no. 49),  its  coinage  is  virtually  the  only  coinage  in that  area. 36.

The  city- ethnic  is  (C 4e  coins,  infra). No  source  calls  Alontion  a  polis,  but  it  is  included  here  on account  of  its  C 4e  coins. According  to legend,  Patron  of  Akarnania,  guide  of Anchises  (Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 1.51.2;  for  the  Akarnanian origin  of  Patron,  cf.  Fromentin  ( 1998)  256  ad  Dion.  Hal.  Ant. Rom. 1.51.2),  settled  at  Alontion,  which  would  seem  to  indi- cate  a  claim  to Greek  identity,  and  by C 4e  it  minted  Greek- style  coins  (infra).  Alontion  has  been  identified w ith  San Marco  d'Alunzio  (Bruno  ( 1963)  141\u00ad48),  in  origin  a  Sikel site,  but  with  some  evidence  of  C 4  Hellenisation.  The  few documented  Greek  structures  are  the  remains  of  a  (proba- bly  Hellenistic)  circuit  wall  built  in  isodomic  technique  and a  suburban  temple.  In  addition,  coin  types  suggest  cults  of Greek  divinities  (infra). Alontion  struck  bronze  coins  from  C 4e:  obv.  head  of Athena;  rev.  cuttlefish,  legend: .  According 190 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo to  Karlsson  ( 1995)  150,fig.  3,  Alontion  issued  Timoleontic symmachia  coins  with  the  short-haired  Zeus  Eleutherios (but  no  refs.  are  given,  ibid. 166  n. 3);  Rutter  ( 1997)  168 includes  Alontion  in  his  list  of  C 4s  Timoleontic  symmachia coins. 13.

The  toponym  is  `\u00b5, (Hdt. 7.165.1)  or  `\u00b5  (Thuc. 6.62.2;  SEG 11  1223a  (C 5f)). The  city-ethnic  is  `\u00b5  (C 6l  coins,  infra;  Thuc. 7.1.3). Himera  is  repeatedly  described  as  a  Hellenic  polis  (Thuc. 6.62.2;Xen.  Hell. 1.1.37;  Ps.-Skylax 13);  it  is  called  a  polis  both in  the  territorial  sense  (Thuc. 6.62.2)  and  in  the  urban  sense (Xen.  Hell. 1.1.37;  Ps.-Skylax 13),  and  in  the  urban  and  politi- cal  senses  combined  (Aen.  Tact. 10.22).  The  political  sense  is 198 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo found  in  Diod. 11.48.6  (r 476).  Paus. 6.4.11  uses in  a reference  to C 5e,  and  the  politeia  was  included  in  the Aristotelian  collection  of  constitutions  (fr. 515.1).  Thuc. 6.5.1 calls  Himera  an  ,  and  it  is  described  as  the  patra  of the  C 6  poet  Stesichoros  (Test.  A 26,  Davies);  cf.  SEG 29  414.4 (c. 450)  where  [ ] is a possible restoration (cf.  CEG  I 393  for  other  restorations). The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on C 6l  coins  (infra).  The  external  collective  use  of  the  city-eth- nic  is  attested  by  SEG 30  1079  (C 6m)  and  Thuc. 7.1.3,  58.2. Individually,  the  ethnic  is  often  applied  to  Stesichoros  (e.g. Pl.  Phdr. 244A;  IG xii.5  444.73.85b  (C 3f));  see  also  AM 87 ( 1972)  114\u00ad15  no. 6  for  a  possible  Archaic  instance  of  the external  individual  use.  The  use  is  also  attested  in  Pl.  Prt. 335E. Himera  was  founded  by  Zankle  (no. 51)  and  exiles  from Syracuse  (no. 47)  called (Thuc. 6.5.1;but Strabo  6.2.6  says:         ). The oecists  were  Eukleides,  Simos  and  Sakon  (Thuc. 6.5.1;  cf. IGDS  no. 165).  The  year  of  foundation, 648,  is  inferred  from the  notice  that  the  city  was  inhabited  for  240  years  before  its destruction  in  409  (Diod. 13.62.4).  The  continued  ties  with Zankle  are  revealed  by  Skythes,  ruler  of  Zankle,  who  c. 493 went  to  Himera  as  an  exile  (Hdt. 6.24),  and  if  the  text  on  a bronze  plaque  found  at  Himera  is  correctly  reconstructed by Brugnone  ( 1997)  271\u00ad74  as ] ,this may be taken  as  evidence  of  an  \"ethnic\"  phyle  of  Zanklaian  colonis- ers  at  Himera.  But  the  ethnic  composition  of  the  city  was mixed,  the  colonisers  being  mostly  Chalkidian,  i.e.  Ionians, but  some  Syracusans,  i.e.  Dorians;  and  while  the  local  dialect was  a  corresponding  mixture,  Chalkidian  \u00b5\u00b5  prevailed (Thuc. 6.5.1). The  territory was  called  `\u00b5  ( ) (Thuc. 3.115.1;Diod.  13.61.4  (r 409)).  The  C 5  immediate  hinterland with  a  number  of  rural  settlements,  delimited  by  border fortresses,  encompassed  c. 50  km \u00b2  (Belvedere  ( 1988) 196\u00ad206,(2000)).  The  territory  of  Himera  stretched  over  a vast  area,  estimated  at  c. 700  km \u00b2,  divided  to the  south  from the  territories  of  Gela  (no. 17)  and  Akragas  (no. 9)  by  the Monte  Cassero  hills,  and  in  the  west  at  the  river  Thermos from  the  territory  of  the  Phoenician  city  of  Soloeis. However,  within  the  territory  of  Himera  were  scattered indigenous  settlements,  and  the  dividing  line  between  the dominions  of  Himera,  Gela  and  Akragas  is  not  always  clear (Vassallo  ( 1996)).  SEG 30  1079  (C 6m)  seems  to  attest  to fighting between H imera  and  Sikanoi  (cf.  Thuc. 3.115.2).  For the  Archaic  and  Classical  settlement  pattern  of  the Himeraian  territory,  see  Belvedere  ( 1988)  196\u00ad206. According  to Diod. 13.62.4,  c. 3,000  andres  were  captured during  the  destruction  in  409,  but  it  seems  impossible  to convert  this  number  into  a  population  estimate  (cf.  the  few army  figures below).  The  C 5e  population  has  been  calculat- ed  at  20,000,  including  a  rural  population  of 10,000,by Asheri  ( 1973),  but  this  figure is probably on the low side,  if one  takes  into  account  that  the  size  of  the  urban  centre  of Himera  is  now  calculated  to  be  c. 80  ha  (Allegro and  Vassallo ( 1992)  147\u00ad48). Himera  was  pillaged  and  destroyed  by  the  Carthaginians in 409;  3,000  surviving  men  were  put  to death ( ),women and children were distributed to the victorious  enemy  and  presumably  enslaved  (Diod. 13.59.4\u00ad62.5),  and  the  site  was  abandoned  (Diod. 11.49.4; Strabo  6.2.6),  though  there  is  some  archaeological  and numismatic  evidence  for  re-occupation  from  c. 405  until  the defeat  of  Dionysios  I  at  Kronion  in  383/2,  when  Himera became  part  of  Carthaginian  territory  for  good  (Diod. 15.16.3).  Later  references  to Himera  must  therefore  be  to the survivors  who  were  settled  at  Thermai,  on  the  border  of Greek  and  Phoenician  spheres  of  interest  (Cic.  Verr. 2.2.86; cf.  Diod. 14.47.6,  56.2). According  to  Arist.  Rh. 1393b10\u00ad22,  Phalaris,  the  tyrant  of Akragas  c. 570\u00ad554,  was  elected  strategos  autokrator  by  the Himeraians,  but  the  historicity  of  the  report  is  doubtful (Berve ( 1967)  130).  By  C 5e,  however,  the  city  was  certainly ruled  by  tyrants.  The  earliest  attested  tyrant  is  Terillos ( ,  Hdt. 7.165)  who,  expelled  by  Theron  of  Akragas, attempted  to  return  as  an  ally  of  the  Carthaginians,  seeking help  also  from  Anaxilaos  of  Rhegion  (Hdt. 7.165).  The  ensu- ing  battle  at  Himera  in  480  led  to  the  victory  of  Theron  and Gelon  (Diod. 11.20.3ff.;  cf.  Zahrnt  ( 1993)).  Theron  conceded the  tyranny  of  Himera  to  his  son  Thrasydaios  (Diod. 11.48.6).  The  Himeraians  rebelled  against  the  tyranny  of Thrasydaios;  Theron,  having  curbed  the  insurrection, repopulated  Himera  with  Doric  and  \"other\"  colonists  to whom  he  granted  citizenship  (Diod. 11.48.6\u00ad49.4).Not  until 460  were  those  who  escaped  the  intervention  of  Theron  able to  return  to  Himera  (Diod. 11.76.4).  During  the Peloponnesian  War,  Himera  remained  loyal  to  Syracuse  (no. 47)  by  not  admitting  the  Athenian  fleet in  415  (Thuc. 6.62.2) and  by  entering  into  an  alliance  with  Gylippos  against  the Athenians  in  414  (Thuc. 7.1.4;Diod.  13.7.7).  One  thousand hoplites/light-armed  troops,  and  100  cavalry  joined Gylippos  on  his  march  to  Syracuse  (Thuc. 7.1.5). A  bronze  plaque  attests  to the  existence  of at Himera  (Brugnone  ( 1997)  274\u00ad79)  and  may  also  attest  to  a system  of  phylai  (Brugnone  ( 1997)  271\u00ad74). sikelia  199 At  least  three  Himeraian  athletes  won  Panhellenic  victo- ries:  Ischyros  at  Olympia  in  516  (Olympionikai 137)  and Krison  thrice  at  Olympia  in  C 5m  (Olympionikai 294,  306, 312).  Particularly  interesting  is  Ergoteles,  who  won  no  fewer than  eight  Panhellenic  victories  (two  at  Olympia (Olympionikai 224,  251)  and  two  each  at  Delphi,  Nemea  and Isthmia).  A  Cretan  by  birth,  he  was  a  naturalised  Himeraian and  competed  as  such  (Paus. 6.4.11;  cf.  Pind.  Ol. 12  and  SEG 11  1123a  celebrating  Olympic  success;  Phlegon  (FGrHist 415) fr. 1.13). Himera  was  founded  on  a  north\u00adsouth-oriented  oblong hill  between  the  river  Torto  to  the  west  and  the  river  Himera to  the  east,  commanding  the  lower  Himera  valley.  The  city occupied  also  the  coastal  plain  below,  though  whether  this comprised  a  harbour  settlement  near  the  estuary  is  as  yet uncertain  (Bonacasa  ( 1976)  5\u00ad14  for  a  general  description  of the  site). A  stretch  of  a  presumably  Archaic  (no  precise  date)  stone and  earth  rampart  is  known  from  the  southern  edge  of  the plateau,  with  a  semicircular  projection  in  the  south-east corner  and  a  small  stretch  running  northwards  defending the  east  side  of  the  plateau  (Bonacasa  Carra  ( 1974)  110\u00ad11; Bonacasa  ( 1980\u00ad81)  855,  pl. 117,fig.  2),  revealing  that  habita- tion  covered  all  of  the  plateau  at  least  from  the  Archaic  peri- od.  A  wall  of  sun-dried  bricks  along  the  outer  edge  of  the plateau  on  the  northern  side  of  the  sanctuary  is  with  some uncertainty  dated  to  C 5e  and  connected  with  the Carthaginian  conflict of 480.  Dividing  the  upper  city  from the  city  on  the  plain  below,  the  wall  may  have  functioned  as a  diateichisma  (Allegro  ( 1991)  71).  The  walls  are  mentioned by Diod. 13.59.7\u00ad9  in  reference  to the  siege  in  409.  The  upper city  occupied  about  32  ha,  the  lower  city  about  50  ha  (Allegro and  Vassallo  ( 1992)  145\u00ad47). Corresponding  to  the  traditional  date  of  foundation ( 648),  there  is  sporadic  evidence  of  a  C 7m  settlement  on  the coastal  plain  below  the  upper  plateau  near  the  estuary  of  the river  Himera.  The  more  substantial  urban  remains  on  the plateau  of  Himera  are  from  C 7s,  suggesting  a  gradual  urban development  from  plain  to plateau  (Vassallo  ( 1997)  85\u00ad90). Two  Archaic  urban  phases  are  known.  Already  the  earlier (C 7l\u00adC6e)  shows  features  of  planning,  but  it  was  soon replaced  by  a  new  overall  urban  layout,  probably  as  a  result of  destructions  of  the  early  city  and  a  refoundation c. 580\u00ad570  (Allegro  ( 1997)).  Although  the  Archaic  town  plan is  impressive  in  its  size  and  regularity,  the  remains  suggest that  even  in  this  second  period  habitation  was  concentrated in  certain  areas:  the  northern  area  (near  the  sanctuary)  and the  southern  area  (near  the  main  route  to  the  chora).  Recent investigations  have  given  indications  of  a  6.20  m-wide north\u00adsouth-oriented  plateia  uniting  the  main  parts  of  the plateau  (Allegro ( 1988\u00ad89)  656). Theron's repopulation  of  Himera  in  476  (supra)  resulted in  further  developments  and  reorganisation  of  the  city,  indi- cated  by  changes  in  the  layout  of  single  insulae  (Belvedere ( 1976)  580\u00ad82;Allegro ( 1988\u00ad89)  657).  A  redistribution  of land  may  be  inferred  from  C 5e  epigraphic  evidence (Brugnone  ( 1997)). The  lower  city  had  an  urban  plan  from  C 7s,  with  later changes  which  correspond  to  the  phases  of  the  city  outlined above  (Allegro and  Vassallo  ( 1992)).  Recently  a  C 5f  subur- ban  quarter  east  of  the  city  has  been  revealed  between  the right  bank  of  the  river  and  the  Archaic  cemetery  (ibid. 139 n. 40;  cf.  Diod. 13.75.2  (r 408)).  The  cemetery  with  tombs from  the  early  history  of  Himera  until  c. 525  is  located  near the  coast  east  of  the  Himera  valley  (Vassallo  ( 1991), ( 1993\u00ad94)).  From  C 6l  and  for  all  of  C 5  two  new  cemeteries were in  use  south  of  the  city  and  on  the  plateau  west  of  the city  (Di  Stefano  ( 1970)  319\u00ad21;(1976));  tomb  material (amphoras)  reveals  a  wide  commercial  network  (Vassallo  et al.( 1991)). The  north-eastern  corner  of  the  plateau  is  occupied  by  a sanctuary  with  remains  of  four  C 7s\u00adC5e  temples  (Bonacasa ( 1970);  Allegro  ( 1991)),  probably  dedicated  to Athena,  like the  city  itself  and  its  chora  (Diod. 5.3.4).  A  sanctuary  of Demeter  with  at  least  two  C 6\u00adC5  naiskoi  was  located  in  the north-western  quarter  of  the  upper  city  (Himera ii.194\u00ad205; Hinz  ( 1998)  166\u00ad67).  A  monumental  stone  temple,  \"Temple of  Victory\",  again  presumably  dedicated  to Athena (Bonacasa  ( 1980)  269),  was  built  in  the  lower  city  in  C 5e  (P. Marconi ( 1931);  T.  Van  Compernolle  ( 1989)  48\u00ad51,(1992) 55\u00ad58),probably  to commemorate  the  victory  over  Carthage in 480  (cf.  Diod. 11.25.1)  or  built  by  Theron  in  connection with  his  resettlement  of  the  colony  in  476  (cf.  P.  Marconi ( 1931)  127  for  an  earlier  Archaic  phase).  Attested  cults include,  in  addition  to  that  of  Athena  (Diod. 5.3.4),  those  of Zeus  Soter  (C 5l:  Manni  Piraino  ( 1974)  267\u00ad69);  Herakles (Diod. 5.3.4;  Bonacasa  ( 1991));  the  nymph  Himera  (coins;  cf. Cic.  Verr. 2.2.87);  Tyche  Soteira  and  Zeus  Eleutherios  (Pind. Ol. 12.1\u00ad3). Himera  began  minting  drachms  on  the  Euboian\u00ad Chalkidian  standard  c. 550\u00ad540:  obv.cock;  rev.  incuse square  with  sunk  and  raised  triangles  within  a  square  incuse  field ( SNG  Cop.  Sicily 294\u00ad96,  297  (obol)).  Later issues  have  rev.  hen  in  a  square  incuse  field,  and  there  are several  variations  of  the  basic  type  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 298\u00ad301).  An  early  issue  has  obv.  legend , 200 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo abbreviated  on  later  issues  to ,  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 301).Other  coin  legends  are  names  of  mint  officials,  in  full  or abbreviated: ,  ,  ,  [].  Lower denominations  carry  related  types  (Kraay  ( 1984); C.  Boehringer  ( 1984\u00ad85)  105\u00ad8;  Molinari  ( 1986)).  The  first series  ends  c. 484/3  with  the  expulsion  of  Terillos; Akragantine  control  at  Himera  c. 483\u00ad470  is  reflected in an issue  of  didrachms  on  the  Attic  standard:  obv.  cock,  some with  legend  ;  rev.  crab  (Jenkins  ( 1971);  SNG  Cop. Sicily 302\u00ad3,  304  (drachm)).  During  the  subsequent  period of  Syracusan  influence a new c oinage  was  introduced  with the  principal  denomination  based  upon  the  Syracusan tetradrachm:  obv.  quadriga,  crowned  by  Nike;  rev.nymph Himera  pours  a  libation  at  an  altar,  at  her  side  a  Silenos bathes  in  a  fountain  with  a  spout  in  the  form  of  a  lion's  head (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 306).A  variant  has  on  the  obv.  biga,  legend: ;  rev.  figure of  nymph  named   (Kraay ( 1976)  215,  pl. 765).  This  issue  may  celebrate  the  vic- tory  of  Ergoteles  at  Olympia  in  472  or 464,  and  according  to  Biucchi  ( 1988)  the  series  may  commence  as  late  as  464.A late  tetradrachm  known  from  one  issue  only  has  obv. quadriga  galloping,  above  flying N ike  with  wreath  and tablet  with  inscription  (signature  ?);  rev.  nymph  at  altar  and Silenos  bathing  under  lion-head  spout,  legend: ,probably from very shortly  before  the  409/8  disaster (C.  Boehringer  ( 1989)  34).  Lower  denominations  are  litrai: obv.  forepart  of  winged,  man-headed  monster;  rev.  goat- rider;  hemidrachms:  obv.  goat-rider,  rev.  Nike  holding  a phlaston  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 307\u00ad11).  Bronze  coinage  was introduced  c. 420  (Kraay  ( 1979);  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 313\u00ad19). Coins  were  minted  during  the  resettlement  period c. 405\u00ad383/2:  lower  bronze  denominations  with  legend  ; C 4  issue  of  silver  litrai:  obv.  Herakles;  rev.  palladion,  legend: (C.  Boehringer  ( 1989)).  There  is  some  evi- dence  of  coinage  during  the  reign  of  Timoleon;  an  issue influenced b y  the  Zeus  Eleutherios  type,  after  the  battle  of Krimissos  in  342/1:  obv.  Kronos,  legend: ; rev.  eagle  and  thunderbolt,  legend:  (C.  Boehringer  ( 1989)  36).  On  the  evidence  of  bronze  ingots counterstamped  with  Himeraian  mint  types,  flans,  bronze bars  and  slags,  the  public  mint  has  been  identified w ith  a structure  inside  the  sanctuary  in  the  north-eastern  corner  of the  plateau  (Cutroni  Tusa  ( 1982a)). 25. ", "Akragas": "Identifier: 10. , (Akragantinos) Map  47.  Lat. 37.20,long.  13.35. Size of  territory: 5.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is  , (Pind.  Ol. 2.6;  Thuc. 6.4.4),the  city-ethnic  is   (Hdt. 7.165;  IGDS  no. 182a). Akragas  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Empedokles fr. 112.2  (DK): '      (acropolis  itself  occurs  at Diod. 13.84.3  (r 406)),  by  Xen.  Hell. 2.2.24  (cf.  Pind.  Ol. 2.93 and  Pyth. 12.1)  and  by  Ps.-Skylax  13  (where  it  is  listed  under the  heading   ` );  in  the  political  sense polis  occurs  in  Thuc. 6.4.4,  7.46.1.The  politeia  was  described by  Aristotle  (Arist.  fr. 479);  Empedokles  has  patris  (fr. 157.2, DK)  and  (fr. 112.1,  DK). The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on C 5s  coins  (infra),  the  internal  individual  use  in  Empedokles fr. 157.1,DK.The  external  collective  use  is  found  at  Hdt. 7.165 and  in  IGDS  nos. 95  and 182  (C 5);  the  external  individual  use is  found  in  Hesperia 43  ( 1974)  322,no.  3.6  ( 331\u00ad324)  and  presumably  in  IGDS  no. 182b  (C 5);  it  is  applied  also  to Empedokles  (e.g.  Arist.  Cael. 279b16). Akragas  was  founded  by  Gela  (Thuc. 6.4.4),  according  to other  sources  with  the  participation  of  a  Rhodian  contin- gent  (Pind.  fr. 105,Bowra;  Polyb. 9.27.8),  108  years  after  the foundation  of  Gela,  i.e.  c. 580  (Thuc. 6.4.4),  100  years  before the  Olympic  victory  of  Theron  at  the  76th  Olympiad  ( 476) according  to  Pindar  (Ol. 2.166\u00ad69  with  schol.).  The  oecists were  Aristonoos  and  Pystilos  (Thuc. 6.4.4).  Of  the  two oecists  mentioned  in  the  sources,  one  may  have  come  from Gela,  the  other  from  Gela's  metropolis,  Rhodos  (cf. Leschhorn  ( 1984)  52\u00ad53;  Musti  ( 1992)).  The  archaeological evidence,  above  all  that  from  the  Montelusa  cemetery,  is  in agreement  with  the  time  of  foundation  given  by  the  literary sources  (Waele  ( 1971)  88\u00ad97;  De  Miro  ( 1988b)  240\u00ad44).  The institutions  of  Akragas  were  modelled  on  those  of  Gela (Thuc. 6.4.4: \u00b5\u00b5  ). The  foundation  of  Akragas  secured  Geloan  interests westwards.  It  is  therefore  not  easy  to  map  Akragantine  and Geloan  spheres  of  influence since sites such as V assallaggi and  Sabucina  may  have  had  first a Geloan,  later  an Akragantine  phase.  However,  territorial  ambitions  under Phalaris  secured  territory  westwards  to  the  river  Halykos and  Selinountine  territory  with  the  site  of  Minoa,  a  city founded  by  Selinous  (Hdt. 5.46.2);a  palladion  taken  as  spoils from  the  city  of  Minoa  was  dedicated  to  Athena  Lindia  by the  Akragantines  (Lind.  Chron.  (FGrHist 532)  fr. 30  Xenagoras  (FGrHist 240)  fr. 17).  A  number  of  phrouria laid  out  by  Phalaris  in  Akragantine  territory  in  the  Himera valley  are  listed  by Diod. 19.108.1\u00ad2  ((rC 6);  cf.  Polyaen. 5.1.3), but  the  tradition  that  Phalaris  had  a  phrourion  on  the Eknomos  hill  may  be  a  late  fabrication;  the  site  is  normally located  somewhere  in  the  hills  above  Licata  (Bejor  ( 1989d)). Spoils  captured  from  Kokalos  dedicated  to  Athena  Lindia are  listed  in  the  Lindian  Chronicle  ((FGrHist 532)  fr. 27  Xenagoras  (FGrHist 240)  fr. 14;  survey  of  sources: Braccesi  and  De  Miro  ( 1992)  8\u00ad12).  Kamikos,  the  seat  of  Kokalos,  was  somewhere  in  the  Akragantine  hinterland (cf.  Hdt. 7.170.1,  who  calls  it  a  polis  inhabited  in  his  day  by  Akragantines:  \u00b5,  '   \u00b5    \u00b5;Diod.  4.78.2;  De  Miro  ( 1962)). Under  Theron,  Himera  came  within  the  Akragantine  sphere of  influence,  and  the  domination  of  Akragas  in  the  decade 483\u00ad472  is  reflected in the crab appearing on the rev.  of  the coins  of  Himera  (Hdt. 7.165;  Bonacasa  ( 1992);  cf.  the  entry for  Himera).  The  influence of  Akragas  over  a  vast  area  of central  Sicily  is  inferred  also  from  the  circulation  of  C 5s Akragantine  bronze  coins  (Vassallo  ( 1983)).  The  settlement pattern  in  the  chora  of  Akragas  is  little  known,  and  only  a  few  suburban  sanctuaries  are  known,  among  them  the  sanctuary  dedicated  to  chthonic  divinities  at  Palma  di Montechiaro  on  the  coast  20  km  south-east  of  Akragas (Castellana  ( 1994)).  There  is  evidence  of  a  number  of  C 6 phrouria  and  C 6  Hellenised  settlements  along  the  coast between  Gela  and  Akragas  (Bejor  ( 1987);  Castellana  ( 1994) 302\u00ad4).  Plut.  Dio 49.1  mentions  a  site  in  Akragantine  territo- ry called    which  is,  however,  unlocated.  Diod. 13.81.3  (r 406)  refers  to in  the  territory  when  it  was evacuated  in  the  face  of  the  Carthaginian  threat. According  to  Diog.  Laert. 8.63,  Akragas  had  a  population of 800,000  inhabitants  at  the  time  of  Empedokles,  an  obvi- ous  exaggeration  (Waele  ( 1979)).  According  to  Diod. 11.53.5, 4,000  Akragantines  and  Himeraians  were  killed  in  battle against  Hieron  in  472,but  the  number  of  Akragantines  is  not specified.  At 12.8.4  Diodorus  relates  that  a  thousand Akragantines  were  killed  at  the  battle  of  Himera  in  446.At the  time  of  the  Carthaginian  conflicts,  Akragas  had,  accord- 186 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo ing  to Diod. 13.84.4,  90.3,  a  population  of  more  than  20,000 citizens  and  with  resident  foreigners  not  less  than  200,000 inhabitants  (cf.  Waele  ( 1979)). The  constitutional  history  of  the  city  was  eventful.Within ten  years  of  its  foundation,  power  was  seized  by  Phalaris (c. 570\u00ad554),  who  is  described  as  a       \u00b5 by  Arist.  Pol. 1310b28.  His  reign  was  a  period  of  expansion, with  several  victories  over  the  indigenous  population,  in particular  the  victory  over  the  Sikanian  stronghold  of  Uessa (Polyaen. 5.1.4),and  the  conquest  of  Minoa;  the  Akragantine dedication  to  Athena  Lindia  of  a  palladion  was  booty  taken  from  this  town (Lind.  Chron.  (FGrHist 532)  fr. 30  Xenagoras  (FGrHist 240)  fr. 30).  Phalaris  may  have extended  Akragantine  influence t o  Himera  (no. 24),  see Arist.  Rh. 1393b11ff.,  who  reports  that  the  Himeraians  chose him  as  .  The  rule  of  Phalaris  was followed  by  those  of  Alkamenes  and  Alkandros  (Heracl. Lemb. 69).  Though  there  may  have  been  a  democracy  in existence  before  the  tyranny  of  Theron  (E.  W.  Robinson ( 1997)  78\u00ad80,  based  on  Diod. 11.48.6\u00ad8),  tyranny  persisted  at Akragas  during  C 5f,  and  Theron  ( 489/8\u00ad473/2),  variously described  as  \u00b5  (Hdt. 7.165)  or  (Timaios (FGrHist 566)  fr. 93),  with  Gelon  defeated  the  Carthaginians and  their  ally  Terillos  at  Himera  in  480  (Hdt. 7.166;Diod. 11.20\u00ad22);  Theron's  son  Thrasydaios  was  installed  as  tyrant in  Himera  (Diod. 11.48.6).  Theron  died  after  a  reign  of  six- teen  years  and  was  honoured  as  a  hero  (Diod. 11.53.1\u00ad2);  he was  succeeded  by  Thrasydaios  in  Akragas  (Timaios (FGrHist 566)  fr. 93),  who  for  a  year  exercised  power \u00b5    (Diod. 11.53.3).  The  subse- quent  conflict w ith  Hieron  and  the  fall  of  Thrasydaios  led  to the  establishment  of  a  democratic  government  in  471  (Diod. 11.53.5)  and  the  return  to  their  native  country  of  the   ,  who  were  given  back  their  civic  rights  (Diod. 11.76.5).  Empedokles  is  reported  (by  Diog.  Laert. 8.66  Timaios  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 2)  to  have  put  an  end  to  an oligarchy  \"of  the  1,000\"(      \u00b5) which had  existed  for  three  years,  but  refused  the  offer  of  (Xanthos  (FGrHist 765)  fr. 33;  Arist.  fr. 865),  thereby  obtain- ing  a  cessation  of  stasis  and  bringing  about  political  equality (Neanthes  (FGrHist 84)  fr. 28).Exactly  when  this  occurred  is uncertain,  but  E.  W.  Robinson  ( 1997)  78\u00ad80  assumes  that  it was  some  years  after  the  fall  of  the  tyranny,  possibly c. 454\u00ad442,  and  if  so  the  city  experienced  a  three-year  oli- garchic  interlude. Akragas  took  part  in  the  war  against  Douketios  (Diod. 11.91.3\u00ad4  (r 451)).  The  rivalry  with  Syracuse  led  to  a  war which  involved  allies  on  both  sides  and  ended  in  an Akragantine  defeat  at  Himera,  with  envoys  concluding peace  at  Syracuse  (Diod. 12.8.2\u00ad4  (r 446),  26.3).  The Athenian  expedition  to  Sicily  in  422  led  to  an  alliance between  Athens  (no. 361)  and  Akragas  in  422  (Thuc. 5.4.6); Akragas  hindered  the  passage  through  its  territory  of  troops allied  with  Syracuse  (no. 47)  in  415  (Thuc. 7.32.1)  and remained  neutral  (Thuc. 7.33.2,  58.1);  following  a  stasis,  cit- izens  friendly  to  Syracuse  were  expelled  (Thuc. 7.50.1). In C 5l  Akragas  became  involved  in  the  Carthaginian  inva- sion  of  Sicily.  It  did  not  succeed  in  bringing  help  to  Selinous (no. 44)  in  409  (Diod. 13.56.1),  but  received  the  survivors (Diod. 13.58.3).In  its  turn  Akragas  was  besieged  and  taken  by the  Carthaginians  in  406  (Diod. 13.85\u00ad89).  The  inhabitants took  refuge  first at Gela (no. 17)  and  afterwards  at  Leontinoi (no. 33;Diod.  13.89\u00ad90),  and  the  city  itself  was  destroyed  by Himilkon  (Diod. 13.108.2).  The  prosperity  brought  by  the reign  of  Timoleon  led  to  the  refoundation  of  Akragas  by Megillos  and  Pheristos  of  Hyele  (Plut.  Tim. 35.2;  for  the problem  of  an  Ionian  city  refounding  a  Dorian  city,  see Talbert  ( 1974)  204\u00ad5). The  existence  of  archontes,  boule  and  dikasterion  is  attest- ed  for  C 5  (Timaios  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 134  Diog.  Laert. 8.64; cf.  Asheri  ( 1992a)).  Strategoi  and  the  ekklesia  are  attested  for 406  (Diod. 87.4\u00ad5).  The  passing  of  a  decree  preparing  for resistance  against  Carthage  is  mentioned  in  Diod. 13.81.2 (r 406). In 356/5  a  citizen  of  Akragas  served  as  theorodokos  of Epidauros  (no. 348;  IG iv\u00b2.195.ii.91),  and  c. 331\u00ad324  one  of  its citizens  was  appointed  proxenos  by  Athens  (no. 361;  Hesperia 43  ( 1974)  322,no.  3).  Reception  of  envoys  is  attested  at  Diod. 11.68.1  (r 466);  the  sending  of  envoys  is  attested  in  Diod. 12.8.4  (r 446). The  city  was  surrounded  on  the  west  by  the  river  Hypsas and  on  the  east  by  the  river  Akragas,  with  their  confluence just  below  the  city.  Ancient  remains  at  the  estuary  may  attest harbour  structures  (Waele  ( 1971)  4),  and  a  small  coastal trading  station  (serving  as  a  harbour,  cf.  epineion  at  Strabo 6.2.5),  contemporary  with  the  foundation  of  Akragas,  is inferred  from  the  vast  C 6e\u00adC5  cemetery  on  the  Montelusa hill  near  the  coast  (De  Miro  ( 1988b)  240\u00ad44;  earlier  research: Waele  ( 1971)  6). Akragas  lay  about  4  km  from  the  coast  on  a  low  sloping plateau  surrounded  on  the  north,  east  and  south  by  a  ridge of  hills,  the  northernmost  of  which  may  have  been  the acropolis  with  a  temple  of  Athena,  the  eastern  and  southern hills  being  occupied  by  other  important  sanctuaries.  The steep  slopes  created  natural  defences,  in  part  strengthened by  walls  raised  on  the  crest  of  the  hills  (Polyb. 9.27.3\u00ad4).  The sikelia  187 C 6e  circuit  wall  was  built  in  local  limestone  in  an  ashlar technique.  Eight  or  nine  gates  gave  access  to  the  city  at  natu- ral  openings  in  the  ridge  of  hills  (cf.  P.  Marconi  ( 1929)  32\u00ad41, fig. 15).  Diod. 13.81.3  refers  to in  reference  to 406  when it  was  decided  to  evacuate  the  territory  and  take  refuge behind  the  fortifications. The  hill  of  Athena,  used  as  a  retreat  during  the  assault  of the  Carthaginians  (Diod. 13.85.4  (r 406)),  is  normally  inter- preted  as  the  acropolis  of  the  city  (Polyb. 9.27.6).  Polyb. 9.27.7  locates  the  temples  of  Athena  and  Zeus  Atabyrios  on the  highest  point  of  the  city,  but  whether  the  Athenaion (probably  the  sanctuary  of  Athena  Polias)  and  the  temple  of Zeus  were  located  on  the  highest  point  of  the  mediaeval  city of  Girgenti  or  further  south  on  the  \"Rupe  Atenea\"  hill  is  still not  clear;  also  all  of  the  hills  in  the  north  and  north-east  may have  constituted  a  single  acropolis  (Waele  ( 1971)  217\u00ad22). Akragas  presents  one  of  the  most  impressive examples  of Sicilian  urban  planning.  Although  the  fully  excavated  insu- lae  are  mainly  of  later  date,  the  urban  layout  of  the  Archaic and  Classical  city  may  be  reconstructed  as  an  orthogonally planned  city  with  plateiai  oriented  east\u00adwest,  and  stenopoi oriented  north\u00adsouth;  investigations  in  the  habitation  area west  of  the  Olympieion  point  to  C 6s\u00adC5e  for  the  overall urban  layout  (De  Miro  ( 1980)  711\u00ad15,(1992)  155).  The  north- western  part  of  the  city  had  a  slightly  different  orientation. The  urban  area  comprised  c. 625  ha  including  the  surround- ing  hills,  while  the  habitation  area  on  the  plateau  comprised c. 140  ha  (Hoepfner  and  Schwandner  ( 1994)  5).  C 5fwit- nessed  significant building activity at Akragas (see e.g.  Diod. 11.25),  with  several  allusions  to  the  high  standard  of  living  of the  inhabitants  (e.g.  Heraclid.  Pont.  fr. 76,  Wehrli;  Diod. 13.81.4\u00ad5). The  bouleuterion  and  the  ekklesiasterion  were  situated centrally  in  the  urban  layout  on  the  small  hill  of  S.  Nicola (De  Miro  ( 1988a)  66,fig.  2).  The  hill  was  laid  out  as  a  sanctu- ary  in  C 6,  but  from  the  C 4  became  the  focus  of  civic  structures,  perhaps  with  a  surrounding  agora.  The  C 4l bouleuterion,  replacing  C 6\u00adC4  temples,  was  built  on  the northern  part  of  the  hill  on  an  artificial t errace  supported  by a  new,  monumental  terrace  wall  which  endows  the  area  with some  monumentality.  The  seating  capacity  was  c. 300  (De Miro ( 1985\u00ad86)).  The  ekklesiasterion  was  situated  south  of the  bouleuterion  on  the  southern  slope  of  the  S.  Nicola  hill (De  Miro  ( 1988a)  66,fig.  2).  The  koilon,  covering  about  1,250 m \u00b2,  had  a  seating  capacity  of  c. 3,000  (Hansen  and  Fischer- Hansen  ( 1994)  57  with  refs.).  The  excavators  date  the  struc- ture  to  C 4\u00adC3,  though  earlier  dates  have  been  suggested, such  as  the  period  of  the  refoundation  of  Akragas  by Timoleon, 339  (cf.  Plut.  Tim. 35.2),  or  even  C 5  (Greco  and Theodorescu  ( 1983)  45,  79).  The  open  space  north-east  of the  Olympieion  sanctuary  has  tentatively  been  identified with  a  lower,  mercantile(?)  agora  (Fiorentini  ( 1990)  17). Stoas  are  now  known  from  the  early  urban  history  (De Miro ( 1977)  95\u00ad96).  The  remains  of  a  theatre(?)  mentioned by  Fazello  (sixteenth  century  ad)  is  surmised  in  the  S.  Nicola area,  near  the  other  public  buildings,  but  there  are  no remains.  A  C 5  fountain  house  was  part  of  the  sanctuary  of Demeter  below  the  Rupe  Atenea  (Siracusano  ( 1983)).  Public works  begun  after  the  victory  at  Himera  in  480  included underground  conduits  to  carry  waste  water  away  from  the city  constructed  by  the  architect  Phaeax.  The  \"swimming- bath\",  kolumbethra,  mentioned  by  Diodorus,  seven  stades  in circumference,  probably  fed  the  water  supply  of  the  city (Diod. 11.25.3\u00ad4  (r 480);  cf.  also  Waele  ( 1971)  52,  113;  Wilson ( 2000)  7). The  sources  refer  to  cults  of  Zeus,  Hera,  Apollo,  Athena, Demeter,  Kore  and  Hermes  (Waele  ( 1971)  185\u00ad207).  The  epi- thet  of  the  Athena  of  the  sanctuary  located  on  the  acropolis (Diod. 13.85.4;Polyb.  9.27.7;  supra)  is  uncertain.  The Geloan-Rhodian  origin  of  the  settlers  may  suggest  Lindia, but  in  Polyaen. 6.51  we  have  Polias.  A  Rhodian  origin  of  the major  city  cults  is  corroborated  by  the  Rhodian  origin  of  the cult  of  Zeus  Atabyrios  located  on  the  acropolis  (Polyb. 9.27.7).According  to Polyaen. 5.1.1,a  temple  was  dedicated  to Zeus  Polieus,  but  it  is  most  likely  the  same  cult.  A  cult  of Demeter  is  known  from  Pind.  Pyth. 12.1\u00ad2  and  from Polyaen. 5.1.1  (a  thesmophorion).  The  cult  statue  of  Apollo  in a  suburban  Asklepieion  (Polyb. 1.18.2)  was  the  work of Myron  (Cic.  Verr. 4.43.93). A  survey  of  the  remains  of  the  urban  sanctuaries  com- prises  the  following:  C 5e  remains  of  a  Doric  temple  (temple \"E\")  partly  incorporated  in  the  Christian  basilica  of  S.  Maria dei  Greci,  in  the  mediaeval  city  of  Girgenti,  possibly  the temple  of  Athena  Polias  (P.  Marconi  ( 1929)  77\u00ad80;Waele ( 1971)  110).  Rupe  Atenea:  at  S.  Biagio,  a  C 5e  naiskos  (temple \"C\")  dedicated  to  Demeter  (P.  Marconi  ( 1929)  66\u00ad72;Waele ( 1971)  199\u00ad200;  Hinz  ( 1998)  74\u00ad79).  The  row  of  sanctuaries on  the  southern  crest  of  the  city,  from  east  to  west:  temple \"D\",  C 5m,  cult  unknown  (P.  Marconi  ( 1929)  72\u00ad76);  temple \"F\",  C 5s,  cult  unknown  (ibid. 80\u00ad86);  \"Tempietto  di  Villa Aurea\",  C 6l,  cult  unknown  (ibid. 46);  temple  \"A\",  C 6l,  cult unknown  (ibid. 51\u00ad57;  T.  Van  Compernolle  ( 1989)  51\u00ad54); Olympieion  (temple  \"B\"), 480\u00adc.440(?)  (Diod. 13.81.1\u00ad4; Polyb. 9.27.9;  Marconi  ( 1929)  57\u00ad66;  Bell  ( 1980);  T.  Van Compernolle  ( 1989)  60\u00ad68,(1992)  62\u00ad67).  Archaic  architec- tural  terracottas  from  east  of  the  Olympieion  are  taken  as 188 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo evidence  of  an  Archaic  sanctuary  in  the  vicinity,  unknown cult  (P.  Marconi  ( 1929)  46,155\u00ad56).A  sanctuary  to  the  west  of the  Olympieion  at  gate  5;a C 6s  temple  in  antis  and  a  \"lesche\" or  oikos,  from  the  C 5  sanctuary  enlarged  with  a  stoa  or  por- ticus  and  other  buildings  (De  Miro  ( 1977)  94\u00ad100).  Further west,  the  C 5l  temple  \"G\";  in  the  cella,  remains  were  found  of an  earlier  Archaic  naiskos  (P.  Marconi  ( 1929)  86\u00ad87).  Near the  sanctuary  of  the  chthonic  divinities  (Waele  ( 1971) 195\u00ad99;  Hinz  ( 1998)  79\u00ad90):  temple  \"I\",  C 5m;  north  of  this, remains  of  two  C 6  naiskoi  possibly  superseded  by  temple  \"I\" in  C 5m.  The  central  part  of  the  city,  the  S.  Nicola  hill,  was laid  out  as  a  sanctuary  with  at  least  two  temples  in  the Archaic  period;  the  structure  of  one  was  partly  reused  in  a C 4e  naiskos,  the  cult  was  possibly  that  of  Demeter  (Polacco ( 1988);  Hinz  ( 1998)  90\u00ad91).  The  identification of  the  C 5s suburban  sanctuary  located  between  the  city  and  the  coast (P.  Marconi  ( 1929)  87\u00ad93)  as  that  of  Asklepios  rests  upon Polyb. 1.18.2,  but  must  remain  uncertain. The  only  cemetery  of  the  city  itself  yet  examined  in  any detail  is  that  of  Contrada  Pezzino  west  of  the  city,  dating from  the  period  of  the  foundation  to  C 5l,  and  again  from C 4s  (De  Miro  ( 1989)).  Further  cemeteries  were  dispersed along  the  roads  leading  south  and  east  from  the  city. Xenokrates  won  a  Pythian  victory  in  490  (Pind.  Pyth. 6) and  an  Isthmian  victory  in,  presumably, 472  (Pind.  Isth. 2); Exainetos  ( 496),  Empedokles  ( 496)  and  Theron  ( 476)  won in  the  Olympic  Games  (Olympionikai 167,  170,  220),  and Exainetos  (Olympionikai 341,  346)  was  particularly  hon- oured  in  412  when  he  entered  the  city  in  a  chariot  and  was escorted  by  all  the  chariots  of  the  Akragantines, 300  chariots each  drawn  by  two  white  horses  (Diod. 13.82.7).  According to  Pausanias,  Akragas  set  up  a  bronze  group  in  Olympia  to commemorate  a  C 5e(?)  defeat  of  the  Phoenicians  at  Motya (Paus. 5.25.5;  cf.  LSAG 274),  and  a  statue  of  Apollo  was  dedi- cated  at  Delphi  475\u00ad450:  [~  ] (Bousquet  ( 1959)  149\u00ad50).  For  the  dedication  of  the  spoils taken  at  Minoa  to  Athena  Lindia  by  the  Akragantines,  see supra. Akragas  initiated  coinage  c. 520/510  with  an  issue  of  didrachms  on  the  Attic  standard:  obv.  eagle  standing  in profile,  legends: ,  or,  later, , (see  Brugnone  ( 1978)  for  the  use  of  the  sign alpha);  rev.  crab  with,  on  some  later  groups,  officials' names  or  abbreviations.  The  terminal  date  of  the  first issue is  a  little  before  470  (Jenkins  ( 1970)  162\u00ad64;  C.  Boehringer ( 1984\u00ad85)  119\u00ad22;  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 20\u00ad40).  The  tetradrachm replaced  the  didrachm  as  the  main  denomination  c. 464: main  types  as  above,  legend: (SNG.Cop. Sicily 41\u00ad45);  also  lower  denominations  based  on  the  litra (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 46\u00ad51).  Just  before  its  destruction  in  406, Akragas  struck  sophisticated  issues,  some  signed,  and  some  issues  now  used  the  city-ethnic  as  legend: (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 53),  while is found in C4l\u00adC3e.Rare gold issues from  the  same  period  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 52)  may  reflect mint- ing  in  response  to  the  need  to  pay  mercenaries  (cf.  Gela  (no. 17)).  The  first bronze c oinage  of  Akragas,  from  c. 430,  was cast  shapes  (Westermark  ( 1979);  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 61\u00ad63); later  coins  were struck  in  bronze;  types:  obv.  eagle;  rev.crab, some  inscribed  (Vassallo  ( 1983); Westermark  ( 1984);  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 65\u00ad90).  The  city  as refounded  by  Timoleon  c. 338  struck  symmachia  coins  of  the free  horse  type  (Karlsson  ( 1995)  161;  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 91\u00ad92). 10.

The  passage  at  14.90.3  describes  it  as  a polis  symmachis  of  Magon,  and  in  a  later  period  it  was  part  of the  symmachia  of  Agathokles,  alongside  such  poleis  as Kamarina,  Leontinoi,  Katane  and  Messana  (Diod. 19.65.6 (r 315),  19.110.4  (r 311)).

In 396,  Dionysios  I  deprived  Abakainon  of  a  part  of  its chora,  which  was  handed  over  to  his  new  foundation, Tyndaris  (no. 49;Diod.  14.77.5).  Abakainon  was  situated south-east  of  Tyndaris,  at  modern  Tripi.  The  ancient  city, destroyed  by  the  modern,  is  poorly  known.

In C 4l\u00adC3m  Henna  gave  assistance  to  the  people  of  Entella, who  had  been  driven  from  their  city  and  were  received  by the  Hennans       (SEG 30  1123.8\u00ad13;  cf.  SEG 32  914).  The  grateful  Entellans  after  their  return  granted isopoliteia  to  the  people  of  Enna  (SEG 30  1123.16  (C 4l\u00adC3m); cf.  SEG 32  914). According  to  Steph.  Byz. 271.4,  Henna  was  a  foundation by  Syracuse  (no. 47; \u00b5 )  established  in 664.  While  this  may  be  evidence  that  a  Greek  identity  was claimed  for  the  city,  the  historicity  of  the  report  is  doubtful, as  is  the  suggestion  that  it  derives  from  Philistos  of  Syracuse (FGrHist 556,fr.  5;  Manni  ( 1981)  169).  All  evidence  points  to a  Sikulan  site  strongly  Hellenised:  the  archaeological  evid- ence  attests  to  some  degree  of  Hellenisation  already  from C 6e  (pace  Vallet ( 1962)  42),  and  the  degree  of  Hellenisation is  significant from C 5m,  when  Greek-style  coinage  is  intro- duced  and  the  cemeteries  bear  a  strong  Greek  stamp (Fiorentini  ( 1980\u00ad81)  599);  cf.  also  the  reference  to an  agora at  Diod. 14.14.7  (r 403);  late  sources  refer  to  a  theatre (Polyaen. 8.21  (r 214);  Frontin.  Str. 4.7.22).  Traces  of  the  cir- cuit  wall  of  the  acropolis  (cf.  Polyaen. 8.21)  are  known;  the published  drawings  suggest  a  Hellenistic  date  (Orsi  ( 1931) 384\u00ad88;  Fiorentini  ( 1980\u00ad81)  599;  Martorana  ( 1982\u00ad83); Bejor  and  Marotta  D'Agata  ( 1989)).  The  cult  of  Demeter  at Enna  was  famous;  the  sources  for  the  cult  are  mainly  literary (Diod. 5.3.1\u00ad3;Strabo 6.2.6),  whereas  the  archaeological evidence  is  tenuous,  and  the  suggested  location  of  the Demeter  sanctuary  on  a  rocky  spur  north  of  the  settlement plateau  remains  uncertain  (Orsi  ( 1931)  379;  Hinz  ( 1998) 121\u00ad24),  though  a  C 3  inscription  referring  to  Dam[ater]  or Dam[atriastan]  was  found  in  the  vicinity  (IGDS  no. 198). The  strongest  evidence  of  C 5m  Hellenisation  is  provided by  the  minting  of  silver  litrai  from  perhaps  as  early  as  c. 450: obv.  quadriga  driven  by  Demeter  holding  torch;  rev. Demeter  sacrificing at altar holding t orch,  legend: ;  a  variant  issue  has  obv.  head  of  Demeter; rev.

Recently,  Greek-style  silver  and  bronze  coins  of  Herbita have  come  to  light;  they  date  from  the  period  of  Timoleon (c. 350\u00ad325),  and  were found  in  the  region  of  Gangi.  Silver (probably  litrai):  obv.  head  of  Apollo,  legend: ; Rev.  Apollo  seated  on  Ionic  capital.  The  smaller  bronze denominations  carry on  obv.  female  head,  legend: ;  rev.  standing  youth  with  spear  (C.  Boehringer  ( 1981);  Bejor  ( 1989c)  284). Herbita  was  involved  in  colonisation  on  two  occasions:  in 446,  when  Archonides  I  collaborated  with  Douketios  in  the foundation  of  Kale  Akte  (Diod. 12.8.2),  and  in  403,  when Archonides  II  founded  the  city  of  Alaisa  (no. 11),  a  founda- tion  which  eclipsed  its  mother  city  to  the  degree  that  its inhabitants  denied  their  origin  (Diod. 14.16.2\u00ad4;  see  Cataldi ( 1982);  cf.  supra 190).  According  to  Diod. 14.16.2,  Alaisa  was founded  by Archonides  II  in  order  to house  veteran  merce- naries,  a  symmikton  ochlon  that  the  war  against  Dionysios had  driven  into  the  city,  as  well  as  poor  citizens  of  Herbita itself;  the  latter  are  said  to  have  actively  encouraged  his plans. In  a  passage  referring  to 446,Diod.  12.8.2  describes Herbita,  or  at  least  its  ruler  Archonides  I,  as  Sikel;  and  the city  may  be  described  as  Sikel  again  at  Diod. 14.78.7  (r 396). The  Greek  name  Archonides  of  two  of  its  rulers  may  indicate a  pretension  to  Greek  identity  (C.  Boehringer  ( 1981)  95);  but Thuc. 7.1.4  describes  Archonides  I  as  ...   .  By  C 4s,  however,  the  city  issued  Greek- style  coins  (supra). 24. ", "Piakos": "Identifier: 44. , (Piakinos) Map  47.

The  external  individual  use  is  found in  Diod. 1.68.6  (r 528)  and  F.Delphes iii.3202.4  ( 266).  A remarkable  example  is  found  in  IvO 266.2  ( 480\u00ad475),  a  ded- ication  at  Olympia  by  a  Mantinean  who  became  both  a \u00b5and a ,and so was probably a cit- izen  of  Kamarina  who  in  484  was  made  a  citizen  of  Syracuse by  Gelon  (Hansen  ( 1996)  184  and  infra). The  territory  of  Kamarina  (Pelagatti  ( 1980\u00ad81)  pl. 168;Di Stefano  ( 2000)  (chora),  ( 1984\u00ad85)  728,fig.  1  (territory))  is called \u00b5  in  Thuc. 6.5.3  and \u00b5  at  Thuc. 6.78.4.  It  functioned  as  a  buffer  zone between  the  Geloan  and  Syracusan  spheres  of  influence; Philistos  (FGrHist 556)  fr. 5  suggests  that  the  river  Hyrminios (Irminio)  formed  the  border  between  Syracuse  (no. 47)  and Kamarina.  A  number  of  C 6\u00adC4  farmsteads,  some  with  adja- cent  cemeteries,  are  known  from  the  lowland  plains  of  the Hypparis  (Ippari),  the  Oanis  (Rifriscolaro)  and  the Hyrminios  river  valleys.  The  orientation  of  farmsteads located  in  the  hinterland  coincides  with  that  of  the  city,  and the  size  of  the  area  allotted  to  the  single  farmsteads  is  divisi- ble  by  the  size  of  the  urban  insulae,  suggesting  an  organisa- tion  of  the  agricultural  area  analogous  to  that  of  the  C 5  city (Di  Stefano  ( 1993\u00ad94)  1378\u00ad81;  Cordano  and  Di  Stefano ( 1997)  297\u00ad99).  Investigations  have  also  shown  that  a  system of  roads  joined  the  city  with  its  cemeteries  and  the  farm- steads  located  in  the  further  hinterland  (Pelagatti  ( 1980\u00ad81) 723\u00ad29;  Di  Stefano  ( 1984\u00ad85)  762\u00ad64).  On  the  estuary  of  the river  Hyrminios,  at  Contrada  Maistro  c. 15  km  south-east  of Kamarina,  a  harbour  settlement  founded  contemporane- ously  with  Kamarina  may  mark  the  border  between  the  ter- ritories  of  Kamarina  and  Syracuse.  The  site,  which  had  a Demeter  sanctuary  (Cordano  ( 1997)),  was  abandoned  in C 6l  (Di  Stefano  ( 1987b)).To  the  north-west  the  river  Achates (Dirillo)  formed  the  border  with  Geloan  territory.  An important  C 5l  coin  hoard  (IGCH 2095)  from  the  C 6\u00adC5 border  settlement  of  Scornavacche  (ancient  identity unknown)  in  the  Dirillo  valley  has  revealed  contacts  with the  main  Greek  cities  of  Sicily.  Inland  the  territory  of Kamarina  was  delimited  by  the  Hyblaian  mountains,  which constituted  the  border  of  the  territories  of  Kasmenai  (no. 29)  and  Akrai  (no. 10),  and  further  northwards  of  Leontinoi (no. 33).  The  Sikels  of  the  mountainous  hinterland  were allied  with  Kamarina  during  the  C 6m  war  with  Syracuse (Philistos  (FGrHist 556)  fr. 17).  During  the  Hippokratean 202 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo phase  (infra),  Kamarina  was  apparently  forced  to break  with previous  Sikel  allies  such  as  the  city  of  Ergetion  (Polyaen. 5\u00ad6;  cf.  Philistos  (FGrHist 556)  fr. 10  with  Sinatra  ( 1998))  of uncertain  location  in  the  Hyblaian  hills.  However,  the impression  given  by the  evidence  is  that  of  a  network  of  con- tacts  with  the  Sikel  hinterland,  as  far  north  as  the  foothills  of the  Hyblaian  mountains,  a  vast  area  with  a  number  of  Sikel sites  revealing  a  strong  degree  of  C 6  Hellenisation  (Di Stefano  ( 1987a),  ( 1988\u00ad89)  with  refs.).  The  immediate  hin- terland  of  Kamarina  comprised  about  50\u00ad70  km \u00b2,  the  larger territory  (dominion?)  about  500  km \u00b2. Kamarina  was  founded  by  Syracuse  (no. 47),  135  years after  the  foundation  of  Syracuse  itself,  i.e.  c. 598  (Thuc. 6.5.3);  the  date  is  confirmed b y  the  archaeological  evidence (infra).  The  oecists  were  Daskon  and  Menekolos,  the  former a  Syracusan  and  the  latter  probably  a  Corinthian,  as  suggest- ed  by onomastic  evidence  (Cordano  ( 1987)). Philistos  (FGrHist 556)  fr. 5  (rC 6m)  refers  to treaties  of alliance  between  Kamarina  and  Sikels,  Gela  (no. 17)  and other  (presumably  Greek)  communities  in  a  C 6m  war  with Syracuse.  According  to  Thuc. 6.5.3,  the  Kamarinaians  were made  anastatoi  by  Syracuse  after  a  revolt  ( );  this happened  c. 552\u00ad549  (schol.  Pind.  Ol. 5.16),  probably  in  con- nection  with  the  war  attested  in  Philistos  (FGrHist 556)  fr. 5 in  which  both  Syracuse  and  Kamarina  were  assisted  by allies.  However,  the  site  was  apparently  not  depopulated:  not only  is  Parmenides  of  Kamarina  attested  as  victor  at Olympia  in  528  (Olympionikai 125),  but  there  is  no  archaeo- logical  evidence  of  a  break  in  habitation  (Lentini  ( 1983)  5\u00ad6) or  in  the  use  of  the  Archaic  cemetery  (Pelagatti  ( 1976\u00ad77) 523\u00ad26;(1978b));  so  Kamarina  probably  continued  to  exist, possibly  as  a  dependent  polis  of  Syracuse  (cf.  apostasis  in Thuc. 6.5.3  and  the  statement  by  Hdt. 7.154.3:      \u00b5    ).After the defeat of  Syracuse by  Hippokrates  of  Gela  in  the  C 5e  ( 492?)  battle  at  Heloros, Kamarina  passed,  after  arbitration  by  Corinth  (no. 227)  and Korkyra  (no. 123),  from  Syracuse  to  Gela  (Hdt. 7.154.3),  as payment  for  the  release  of  Syracusan  prisoners  of  war (Thuc. 6.5.3).  Hippokrates,  acting  as  oecist  himself, refounded  the  city  c. 490  (Thuc. 6.5.3;  Philistos  (FGrHist 555) fr. 15;  Timaios  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 19).  Casevitz  ( 1985)  168, 172\u00ad73  shows  that  the  term used  by Thucydides  to describe Hippokrates'  refoundation  ( ) mainly desig- nates  the  settling  of  new  inhabitants  and  may  be  used  for  the \"colonisation\"  of  a  site  already  inhabited.  The  term  used  by Philistos  and  Timaios  ( ) implies the participa- tion  in  the  new  foundation  of  various  unspecified g roups (Cordano  ( 1992)  7).In  484  Gelon  destroyed  Kamarina  (Hdt. 7.156.2;  Thuc. 6.5.3)  and  transferred  all  Kamarinaians  to Syracuse,  where  they  received  citizenship  (Hdt. 7.156.2); prior  to  that,  Gelon  had  installed  Glaukos  of  Karystos  as  his governor  in  Kamarina,  and  the  occasion  for  his  destruction of  the  city  was  presumably  its  execution  of  Glaukos  (schol. Aeschin. 3.189;  Demand  ( 1990)  47\u00ad48).Kamarina  now  prob- ably  ceased  to  exist  until  its  refoundation  by  Gela  in  461;at least,  a  decrease  in  the  archaeological  evidence  covering  the years 484\u00ad461  suggests  that  the  site  was  uninhabited  or  only sparsely  inhabited  in  this  period  (Giudice  ( 1988)  esp. 56\u00ad57). In 461  (Diod. 11.76.5)  Kamarina  was  refounded  by  Gela (Thuc. 6.5.3).  In  427  this  third  Kamarina  was  allied  with Leontinoi  (no. 33)  and  Athens  (no. 361)  against  Syracuse (Thuc. 3.86.2,  6.75.3).  At  the  Congress  of  Gela  in  424  it  was decided  that  Kamarina  was  to  receive  Morgantina  (no. 37) on  condition  of  the  payment  of    to Syracuse  (Thuc. 4.65.1).  This  congress  had  been  called  on the  initiative  of  Gela  (no. 17)  and  Kamarina  after  they  had ended  a  mutual  war  by  ekecheiria  (Thuc. 4.58;  Timaios (FGrHist 566)  fr. 22).  In  422  Phaiax  \"won  over\"  Kamarina  to Athens  (Thuc. 5.4.6),  but  the  city  was  allied  with  Syracuse  as well  (Thuc. 6.88.2)  and  eventually  sided  with  her  (infra).  In 405  Kamarina  suffered  from  Carthaginian  attacks  (Diod. 13.108.3),  and  Dionysios  I  forced  the  inhabitants  (    ) to  relocate  to  Syracuse  (Diod. 13.111.3);but  the  Kamarinaians (with  the  Geloans)  left  Syracuse  for  Leontinoi       ( 113.4).  The  405  peace  treaty between  Dionysios  and  Carthage  decreed  that  Kamarina  be ateichistos  and  pay  tribute  to  Carthage  (Diod. 13.114.1).  A Timoleontic  reinforcement  of  the  population  is  reported  by Diod. 16.82.7,  and  the  archaeological  evidence  points  to  a revival  of  the  city  in  C 4s  (Talbert  ( 1974)  149\u00ad50;  Pelagatti ( 1976)). Kamarinaian  military  forces  assisted  Syracuse  during  the conflict w ith  Athens  (Thuc. 6.67.2),although  the  city  initial- ly  attempted  neutrality,  allied  as  it  was  to  both  parties  (Thuc. 6.88.2);  Thuc. 7.33.1  mentions  contingents  of 500  hoplites, 300  akontistai  and 300  toxotai;  a contingent  of  twenty  caval- ry  is  mentioned  at  Thuc. 6.67.2.In 406  Kamarinaian  forces fought  with  Gela  and  Syracuse  against  the  Carthaginians  at the  battle  of  the  river  Himera  (Diod. 13.86.5),  and  Menes  of Kamarina  was  commander  on  this  occasion  ( 13.87.5); Kamarinaian  forces  assisted  Dionysios  again  in  397  (Diod. 14.47.6),and  in  357  troops  from  the  city  assisted  Dion  (Diod. 16.9.5;Plut.  Dio 27.1). Reception  of  envoys  is  attested  at  Thuc. 6.75.3;  sending of  envoys  is  mentioned  in  Timaios  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 22 (r 424). sikelia  203 At  the  refoundation  in  461  a  system  of  civic  subdivisions was  introduced  whereby  the  citizens  were  organised  into phratries  (subdivided  into  triakades  (Cordano  ( 1992); Murray ( 1997)). Glaukos  of  Karystos  presumably  ruled  the  city  as  tyrant on  behalf  of  Gelon  (Berve  ( 1967)  142).  Apart  from  that,  the form  of  constitution  is  unknown,  though  there  are  glimpses of  its  working:  a  death  sentence  passed  by the  assembly  is recorded in reference to c. 484  by  schol.  Aeschin. 3.189,  and  a meeting  of  the  assembly  ( ) is attested in Thuc. 6.75.3\u00ad4.  Thuc. 4.25.7  refers  to  a  faction  which  allegedly  in 425  was  ready  to  betray  the  city  to Syracuse  (cf.  Thuc. 6.88.1 for  the  general  hostility  of  Kamarina  towards  Syracuse). Parmenides  of  Kamarina  was  victorious  at  Olympia  in 528  (Diod. 1.68.6  Olympionikai 125),  and  so  was  Psaumis in 456  and 452  (Olympionikai 280,  292;  cf.  Pind.  Ol. 4\u00ad5). The  town  of  Kamarina  was  founded  on  a  narrow  coastal plateau  between  the  rivers  Hypparis  and  Oanis  (for  the  situ- ation  of  the  city  in  relation  to  rivers,  see  Cordano  and  Di Stefano  ( 1997)).  During  the  C 4s/Timoleontic  phase  the  site comprised  a  fortified area of  not  less  than  150  ha.  There  is  no evidence  of  a  circuit  wall  contemporary  with  the  founda- tion.  The  C 6s  circuit  wall,  with  later  phases,  probably enclosed  an  area  larger  than  that  ascertained  for  the  earliest habitation  phase.  It  was  built  as  a  double  curtain-wall  in  a mixture  of  ashlar  and  small  polygonal  techniques  with internal  fill.  Part  of  the  upper  structure  in  sun-dried  brick has  been  found,  and  there  were  gates  corresponding  to  the routes  westwards  to  Gela  (no. 17),  inland,  and  eastwards  to Heloron  (no. 18)  and  Syracuse  (no. 47).  An outer  proteichis- ma  wall  was  raised  outside  the  north  wall  along  the  river Hypparis  (Pelagatti  ( 1970);  Cordano  and  Di  Stefano  ( 1997) 294\u00ad96). Structural  remains  from  the  earliest  phases  of  the  site have  been  found  above  all  in  the  western  part  of  the  later city,  close  to the  coast  on  the  promontory  proper,  near  the estuary  of  the  river  Hypparis  and  the  harbour.  The  Archaic remains  show  an  organic  layout  with  an  overall  alignment  of the  individual  structures  and  a  specific cult area,  the  Athena Polias  sanctuary  on  the  highest  part  of  the  plateau. Habitation  in  the  early  period  consisted  of  single  houses  and house  plots  with  open  areas.  The  orientation  was  respected by  the  Geloan  refoundation  of 461  (Pelagatti  ( 1976)  122\u00ad25). The  C 5  city  comprised  three  plateiai,  whereas  the  north- eastern  part  of  the  city  with  two  further  plateiai  belongs  to the  C 4s/Timoleontic  foundation;  for  the  public  works  of this  phase,  fortifications and sewers,  see  Cordano  and  Di Stefano  ( 1997)  292\u00ad97.  The  part  of  the  city  facing  the  sea  and the  port  was  from  early  times  laid  out  as  public  space;  the vast  area  may  have  been  divided  into  a  mercantile  agora  and a  civic-political  agora  (Pelagatti  ( 1984\u00ad85)  683\u00ad94;Di Stefano  ( 1993\u00ad94)  1367\u00ad71).  Recent  investigations  at  the mouth  of  the  river  Hypparis  have uncovered  remains  of  an impressive  harbour  structure,  in  part  going  back  to  the Archaic  period  (Di  Stefano  ( 1990)). The  major  sanctuary  of  the  city,  undoubtedly  dedicated to  Athena,  has  roots  in  the  Archaic  period,  but  the  extant remains  of  the  temple  are  of  C 5f  (Di  Stefano  ( 1984\u00ad85) 729\u00ad37).Athena  was  the  patron  divinity  of  Kamarina  (schol. Pind.  Ol. 5),  and  the  epithet  Poliaochos  is  used  by  Pind.  Ol. 5.10\u00ad11.  An  archive  of  C 5m  lead  tablets  listing  citizens  and the  phratries  and  triakades  to  which  they  belonged (Cordano  ( 1992))  was  deposited  in  the  temple  (Di  Stefano ( 1992))  and  demonstrates  the  importance  of  Athena.  The rev.  type  of  litrai  issued  after  the  461  resettlement  depicts Athena  armed,  and  the  cult  statue  of  Athena  Polias  may  have portrayed  her  as  Athena  Promachos  (Rutter  ( 1997)  138). Votive  terracottas  from  the  site  show  Athena  also  as  Ergane (Martin  et al.( 1979)  520).  C 5l  coin  types  depicting  the  main divinities  of  the  city,  Herakles  and  Athena  (Westermark  and Jenkins  ( 1982)  57\u00ad8;  Westermark  ( 1998)  376),  and  personifi- cations  of  the  river-god  Hipparis  and  the  nymph  Kamarina may  also  be  evidence  of  cults  (Lacroix  ( 1965)  115\u00ad16).Apollo Patroos  is  attested  in  C 5  (Manganaro  ( 1995)  98\u00ad103).  A  sub- urban  sanctuary  of  Demeter  south  of  the  city  has  yielded  a few  architectural  remains  and  rich  votive  deposits.  Figurines of  the  type  showing  Demeter  with  a  piglet  attest  to  the Thesmophorian  aspect  of  the  cult  (Giudice  et al.( 1979);  cf. Pelagatti  ( 1980\u00ad81)  716\u00ad18;  Hinz  ( 1998)  119\u00ad21). The  earliest  cemeteries  were  situated  to  the  north-east (Dieci  Salme)  and  the  east  (Rifriscolaro)  of  the  city.  About 2,000  tombs  are  known  at  Rifriscolaro  from  the  period  of the  first generation of  settlers  (Pelagatti  ( 1980\u00ad81)  719\u00ad23). The  Classical  cemetery  belonging  to  the  461  refoundation was  located  south-east  of  the  city  at  Passo  Marinaro,  where about 8,000  m \u00b2  have  been  investigated  so  far  (Di  Stefano ( 1984)  55  n. 1  with  refs.;  Orsi  ( 1990)). Coinage  began  after  the  refoundation  of  Kamarina  by Hippokrates  with  an  issue  of  didrachms  on  the  Attic  stan- dard:  obv.  helmet  on  a  shield;  rev.  palm-tree  flanked b y greaves,  legend: or  (Westermark  and  Jenkins  ( 1980)).  This  issue  lasted  only  to 484,  when  the  city  ceased  to  exist.  Kamarina  as  resettled  in 461  by  Gela  issued  a  series  of  silver  litrai:  obv.  flying N ike; below,  a  swan;  rev.  Athena  standing  and  armed,  legend: (- );  this  issue  ended  c. 440  (SNG 204 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo Cop.  Sicily 158\u00ad60).  A  survey  of  fractional  coins  is  found  in Westermark  and  Jenkins  ( 1982)  48\u00ad52.  The  next  issue  dates from  c. 420,  the  period  of  full  Syracusan  influence: tetradrachms  on  the  Syracusan  standard,  obv.  Athena  as charioteer;  rev.  head  of  Herakles  in  lion-skin  (SNG  Cop. Sicily 161\u00ad63;  a  rare  variant  has  rev.  head  of  Herakles: Westermark  ( 1998)).  Some  dies  are  signed  by  engravers. Didrachms  have  obv.  head  of  the  river-god  Hipparis;  rev. nymph  Kamarina  riding  a  swan  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 164);  leg- end ,  .  Hemidrachms have  obv.  head  of  nymph;  rev.  flying N ike  with  shield (Westermark  and  Jenkins  ( 1980)).  Litrai  have  obv.  head  of Athena;  rev.  Nike  with  wreath;  the  legend   probably  implies  vel  sim.;  one  rare  litra  has  rev. head  of  Herakles  wearing  lion-skin  (Westermark  and Jenkins  ( 1982)  56\u00ad57).  These  issues  ended  with  the  banish- ment  of  the  inhabitants  in  405  (Westermark  and  Jenkins ( 1980);  Cutroni  Tusa  ( 1987)).A  single  gold  coin  may  be  from an  issue  struck  as  a  result  of  Carthaginian  pressure  in  405 (Westermark  and  Jenkins  ( 1980)  no. 206;  Rutter  ( 1997)  148, 154).  Bronze  was  minted  from  C 5s  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 166\u00ad69); a  bronze  issue  of  C 4s  depicts  obv.  Athena  with  helmet,  leg- end: ;  rev.  free  horse  prancing  (SNG Cop.

The  toponym  is  ,  (Thuc. 4.25.7,  6.3.1;  I.Delos 380.85  (rC 5);  cf.  Rutherford  ( 1998)  83). The  city-ethnic  is  (coins  c. 525,  infra),  or   (coins  c. 430,  infra;  Hdt. 7.154.2;  Thuc. 7.57.11). Naxos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Thuc. 4.25.8,  9 and 6.3.1,  50.3,  and  it  is  listed,  with  Tauromenion,  as  a  polis Hellenis  by Ps.-Skylax  13,  although  presumably  it  no  longer existed  by  the  time  this  treatise  was  compiled  (cf.  Flensted- Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  137);  polis  in  the  political  sense  is found  at  Thuc. 7.14.2,  and  the  urban  and  political  senses  are combined  at  Hdt. 7.154.2  (cf.  Hansen  ( 2000)  205).  Patris  is found  at  Diod. 11.49.2  (r 476). The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on coins  from  c. 525  (infra);  the  external  collective  use  is  found in  Hdt. 7.154.2  and  Thuc. 6.50.3  and  IG xi.2245b4  (rC 5;  cf. Rutherford  ( 1998)  82\u00ad83).  Externally  and  individually  the ethnic  is  applied  to  the  oecist  Theokles  (Suda  s.v. :  ;  cf.  B\u00e9rard  ( 1957)  77  n. 1)  and  to  the Olympionikes  Teisandros  (Pind.  fr. 23,  Maehler). The  name  of  the  territory  is  unknown;  it  is  termed  at Thuc. 4.25.8.  Its  extent  is  not  fully  known.  However,  Naxian influence penetrated above all southwards across the Santa Venera  and  Alcantara  river  valleys,  as  borne  out  by  the  foun- dation  of  the  colonies  at  Leontinoi  (no. 33),  Katane  (no. 30) and  Kallipolis  (no. 27).The  site  of  Kallipolis  is  unknown,  but the  listing  of  the  city  with  Katane  and  Leontinoi  suggests  a location  either  in  the  coastal  plain  south  of  Naxos  or  on  the slopes  of  Mt.  Etna  (see  Kallipolis  (no. 27)).  The  rich  C 6\u00adC4 votive  deposit  from  the  Demeter  and  Kore  sanctuary  in  the otherwise  unknown  secondary  settlement  at  Francavilla c. 4  km  inland  along  the  Akesines  (modern  Alcantara)  river valley  has  revealed  Naxian  penetration  north-westwards (Spigo  ( 1989);  Spigo  and  Rizzo  ( 1993\u00ad94);  Hinz  ( 1998) 156\u00ad58).  To the  north  the  territory bordered  upon  that  of Messana,  by  whose  infantry  and  navy  Naxos  was  attacked  in 425  (Thuc. 4.25.7).  Naxos  may  have  had  a  sanctuary  or  a  secondary  settlement  also  on  the  higher  area  of  the  later foundation  of  Tauromenion  (no. 48)  (Bacci  ( 1980\u00ad81b)  742, ( 1984\u00ad85)  722\u00ad23);  according  to Diod. 14.88.1,  the  original colonists  had  expelled  the  native  population  from  the  site  of Tauromenion. Naxos  was  the  earliest  Greek  colony  in  Sicily  (for  the sources  for  its  history,  see  Cordano  ( 1984\u00ad85)).  It  was  foun- ded  by  settlers  from  Chalkis  (no. 365)  on  Euboia  one  year before  the  foundation  of  Syracuse,  i.e.  traditionally  735/4 (Thuc. 6.3.1;  cf.  Diod. 14.88.1),  and  the  traditional  date  (as well  as  ties  with  Euboia)  is  confirmed b y  ceramic  finds from the  earliest  period  of  settlement, 740\u00ad730  (Pelagatti  ( 1981) 304\u00ad11;  Lentini  ( 1993\u00ad94)  1009).  The  oecist  was  Theokles (Thuc. 6.3.1).  The  primary  status  of  Naxos  is  borne  out  by the  tradition  that  the  theoroi  of  the  Sicilian  colonies  offered sacrifice in the sanctuary of  Apollo  Archegetes  at  Naxos before  setting  sail  from  Sicily  (Thuc. 6.3.1).  Ephor.  fr. 132  (cf. Ps.-Skymnos  273\u00ad74)  describes  the  oecist  Theokles  as  an Athenian,  but  that  undoubtedly  reflects later A thenian claims  to  have  played  a  role  in  the  early  colonial  enterprises in  Sicily  (B\u00e9rard  ( 1957)  78\u00ad79).  Later  sources  mention Ionian  and  Megarian  participation  (Ephor.  fr. 137).  Some  of the  settlers  may  have  come  from  Cycladic  Naxos  (cf.  Hellan. fr. 82).The  Cycladic  origin  of  some  of  the  settlers  is  support- ed  by  the  similarity  between  the  coin  types  used  by  Sicilian Naxos  and  by  Cycladic  Naxos,  above  all  the  prominence  of  Dionysos  (Leschhorn  ( 1984)  10  n. 7).  In  addition,  the  let- tering  of  the  Eny\u00f2  inscription  from  the  Scali\u00e0  sanctuary matches  that  used  in  Cycladic  Naxos  (Guarducci  ( 1985)). Naxos  was  subdued  by  Hippokrates  of  Gela,  who  took  the city  after  a  siege  (Hdt. 7.154).  In  476,  Hieron  of  Syracuse transplanted  the  population  of  Naxos  (and  Katane)  to Leontinoi,  where  they  were presumably  granted  citizenship (Diod. 11.49.2),  and  it  seems  that  he  settled  new  colonists  at Naxos  (Diod. 11.49.2:     , though  the  interest  here  seems  to  centre  on  Katane;  but  see infra).  The  expatriated  Naxians  presumably  returned  after Hieron's  death,  as  did  the  Katanaians  (Diod. 11.76.3;  Asheri ( 1980)). According  to  Thuc. 3.86.2,  the  Chalkidikai  poleis  to which Naxos  belonged  were  symmachoi  of  Leontinoi  in  its  conflict with  Syracuse  in  427,  and  the  allies  seem  to  have  acted  as  a single  body  on  an  embassy  to  Athens  (no. 361)  (HCT  ad  loc.); Leontinoi  is  specifically named alongside  \u00b5\u00b5at Thuc.4.25.9in reference to Messana's attack  on Naxos  in  425.  During  the  Athenian  attack  on  Syracuse, Naxos  was  allied  with  Athens  (Thuc. 7.14.2),  and  at  the  battle  of  Epipolai  at  Syracuse  in  414  hippeis  from  Naxos  supported  the  Athenians  (Thuc. 6.98.1;  cf. 7.57.11). In 403 ", "Alaisa": "Identifier: 12. , (Alaisinos) Map  47.  Lat. 38.00,long.  14.15.  Size of  territory:? Type:B: .  The  toponym  is  ,  (Diod. 14.16.2,  4).  The  city-ethnic  is  (C 4m  coins,  infra; Diod. 23.4.1). According  to Diod. 14.16.2,  Alaisa  was  founded  by Archonides  of  Herbita  in  403/2,  in  order  to house  veteran mercenaries,  a  symmikton  ochlon  that  the  war  against Dionysios  had  brought  to  the  city,  as  well  as  poor  citizens  of Herbita  (no. 23)  itself;  in  the  report  of  the  foundation,  Alaisa is  called  a  polis  (       ),  presumably  in both  the  urban  and  the  political  sense.  Another  tradition held  that  it  was  a  foundation  by  Himilkon  of  Carthage (Diod. 14.16.4).In  the  Roman  period,  however,  the  Herbitan origin  of  the  city  was  considered  a  disgrace  by  its  citizens (Diod. 14.16.3),  and  this  may  explain  the  variant  tradition. The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on  C 4s coins  (infra),  and  the  external  collective use  in  Diod. 23.4.1 (r 263). Alaisa  was  member  of  Timoleon's symmachia  (cf.  Diod. 16.73.2  (r 342/1)),  as  can  be  inferred  from  its  minting  of Timoleontic  symmachia  coins  (infra). Alaisa  is  identified w ith  Castel  di  Tusa  on  the  north  coast of  Sicily,  where  there  are  substantial  remains  of  an  ancient urban  site:  habitation  structures  that  reveal  an  orthogonal layout  with  an  agora;  a  circuit  wall  in  ashlar  technique;  a monumental  stoa;  and  remains  of  two  temples,  of  which one  must  have  been  of  Apollo  (infra),  all  Hellenistic (Scibona  ( 1976b)).  The  epiklesis  of  Apollo--Archagetas (infra)--is t estimony  to  the  importance  of  his  cult. Alaisa  struck  Greek-style  bronze  coins  from  the  time  of Timoleon's symmachia  (c. 340):  obv.  Apollo,  legend: ;  rev.  torch  and  stalks  of  barley,  legend: (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 132);  also  Zeus Eleutherios  type:  obv.  head  of  Zeus  Eleutherios  with  short hair,  legend:  ;  rev.  torch  between ears  of  corn,  legend:  . Other  types  depict  Apollo  (legend: ) and the  nymph  Sikelia  (legend: ).  Lower  bronze denominations  have obv.  griffin,  rev.  free  horse,  legend: (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 132\u00ad34).

", "Leontinoi": "Identifier: 34. , (Leontinos) Map  47.  Lat. 37.15,long.  15.00. Size of  territory: 4.Type:A: .The toponym is (IG i\u00b3  54.1;  Thuc. 6.3.3).  The  city-ethnic  is  (Thuc. 3.86.2\u00ad3). Leontinoi  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Thuc. 5.4.3\u00ad4;  Hdt. 7.154.2)  and  in  the  political  sense  (Thuc. 3.86.2; Arist.  Pol. 1316a35\u00ad39).  The  territorial  sense  is  a  connotation at  Thuc. 5.4.3,and  the  political  sense  is  a  connotation  at  Hdt. 7.154.2  (cf.  Hansen  ( 2000)  175\u00ad76,  205).  Politai  is  used  at Thuc. 5.4.2,and  so  is  demos.  The  internal  collective  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  on  C 5f  coins  (infra),  and  the  external collective use  by Hdt. 7.154.2,  Thuc. 5.4.2  and  IG i\u00b3  54.18 (C 5m).  The  external  individual  use  of  the  ethnic  is  found  at Xen.  An. 2.6.16,  Pl.  Ap. 19E  and  CEG 2830.1  (C 4f). Leontinoi  was  one  of  the  early  Chalkidian  colonies  in Sicily,  founded  by  Chalkidians  from  Naxos  under  the  lead- ership  of  Theokles  five y ears  after  the  foundation  of Syracuse  (i.e.  traditionally  729:  Thuc. 6.3.3;  cf.  Hellan.  fr. 82). However,  Theokles  can  hardly  have  been  the  oecist  of Leontinoi,  as  well  as  Naxos  (cf.  Leschhorn  ( 1984)  12). Leontinoi  is  the  only  primary  colony  of  the  Greek  West situated  inland.  According  to  Strabo  6.2.7,  the  territory  ( , Thuc. 5.4.2; ,Diod.  5.8.2)  of  Leontinoi,  called  (Thuc. 5.4.4,  6.65.1)  or   / (Theopomp.  fr. 225a.60;Diod.  4.24.1),  belonged  to the  Naxians;  this  must  refer  to  the  Naxian  origin  of Leontinoi.  The  territory of  Leontinoi  probably  encom- passed  most  of  the  modern  plain  of  Catania,  about  400  km \u00b2. It  is  not  possible  to  define a borderline between K atanaian and  Leontinian  territory.  The  sources  stress  the  beauty  of Leontinoi's  chora  (Diod. 4.24.1)  and  the  importance  of  grain crops  (Diod. 14.58.1  (rC 4e)).The  north  gate  of  Leontinoi  led to  the  Leontine  plain  (Polyb. 7.6).The  Chalkidian  dominion reached  far  inland  along  the  Simeto  and  the  Dittaino  river valleys,  possibly  as  far  as  Monte  San  Mauro,  Grammichele, Morgantina  and  Kenturipe  (Procelli  ( 1989);  see  Katane  (no. 30)). The  population  history  of  Leontinoi  was  eventful:  accord- ing  to  Thuc. 6.4.1,  the  group  of  Megarians  led  by  Lamis  who eventually  founded  Megara  (no. 36)  for  some  time  lived  as citizens  ( \u00b5) at Leontinoi but were expelled ( ).In 476,Hieron of  Syracuse  transplanted  the  pop- ulations  of  Naxos  (no. 41)  and  Katane  (no. 30)  to  Leontinoi (Diod. 11.49.2).After  the  Congress  of  Gela  in  424,new  citizens (politai)  were  enrolled  in  Leontinoi,  and  the  demos  contem- plated  a  redistribution  of  land.  The  result  was  civil  war,  in which  summoned  the  Syracusans.  The  demos  was expelled,  whereas     moved  to  Syracuse  (no. 47), where  they  obtained  citizen  rights,  although  \"later\" ( ) some returned to the old city (Thuc.  5.4.2\u00ad4;  cf. Dreher  ( 1986)).  Leontinoi  ceased  to  be  a  polis,  and  its  site  was turned  into  a  phrourion  of  Syracuse  (Diod. 12.54.7);  the Athenians  had  the  refoundation  of  Leontinoi  as  one  of  their principal  alleged  motives  for  undertaking  the  expedition  to Sicily  in  415  (Thuc. 6.33.2,  48.1,  etc.).  In  405/4  Leontinoi  was resettled  by  citizens  of  Gela  (no. 17)  and  Kamarina  (no. 28; Diod. 13.113.4),  and  the  treaty  concluded  that  year  between Dionysios  I  and  Carthage  stipulated  that  like,  e.g.,  Gela,  the city  was  to  be  autonomos,  and  this  must  have  meant  the refoundation  of  the  city  (Diod. 13.114.1).  Two  years  later ( 403/2),  Dionysios  conquered  Leontinoi  and  moved  all  its inhabitants  to  Syracuse  (Diod. 14.14\u00ad15);  in  396  Dionysios resettled  Leontinoi  with,  allegedly, 10,000  mercenaries  (Diod. 14.78.2).  In  339,  the  population  was  transplanted  to  Syracuse by  Timoleon  (Diod. 16.82.7). From  Thuc. 3.86.2\u00ad3  it  appears  that  in  427  Leontinoi  had treaties  of  symmachia  with  \"the  Chalkidian  poleis\", Kamarina  and  Rhegion  (no. 68),  and  that  these  allies  were also  allied  with  Athens  (by  individual  treaties;  see  ML  63\u00ad64 with  comm.),  and  that  they  were  capable  of  acting  as  a  body (HCT  ad  loc.on    \u00b5\u00b5).  Thuc. 4.24.9  attests  to  a  treaty  of  symmachia  between  Leontinoi and  Naxos  in  425.  During  the  reign  of  Dionysios  II, Leontinoi  seceded  from  Syracuse  and  twice  resisted attempts  to  reconquer  the  city,  the  first b y  Philistos  in  356/5 (Diod. 16.16.1),  the  second  in  342/1  by  Timoleon  (Diod. 16.72.2). Leontinian are  mentioned  at  Thuc. 6.19.1. Several  wars  fought  by  Leontinoi  are  attested:  a  C 6  war  with Megara peri  ges  horon  is  referred  to by Polyaen. 5.47.1,  and  a C 5s  war  with  Syracuse  by  Thuc. 3.86.2.  Campaigns  are  men- tioned  at,  e.g.,  Thuc. 4.25.10,  and  a  \u00b5  at  Thuc. 4.25.11.  The  C 7l\u00adC6e  tyrant  Panaitios served  as  polemarchos  (Polyaen. 5.47.1).  Leontinoi  was  con- quered  by Hippokrates  and  made  a  dependency  of  Gela (Hdt. 7.154.2)  c. 496/5  (Luraghi  ( 1994)  128\u00ad29,  148\u00ad50). Reception  of  envoys  is  attested  by  Diod. 14.14.3;  IG i\u00b3 54.4\u00ad6  (C 5s)  names  three  Leontinian  presbeis,  and  Gorgias was  sent  as  an  envoy  to  Athens  in  427  (Pl.  Hp.  mai. 282B). A  citizen  of  Leontinoi  served  as  theorodokos  of  Epidauros (no. 348)  in  356/5  (IG iv\u00b2.195.ii.66). sikelia  209 In  the  Archaic  period  Leontinoi  was  sometimes  ruled  by  a tyrant;  two  are  mentioned  by  our  sources:  Panaitios,  who  in C 7l  changed  the  oligarchy  (Arist.  Pol. 1315b34\u00ad37)  to  tyranny ek  demagogias  (Arist.  Pol. 1310b29,  1316a37;  Luraghi  ( 1994) 11\u00ad20)  and  Ainesidamos  (Paus. 5.22.7).  A  C 6  stasis  between the  demos  and  the  ruling  oligarchs  is  reported  by  Polyaen. 5.47.1  and  another  stasis  in 424  between  the  dynatoi  and  the demos  by Thuc. 5.4.2\u00ad3  (Berger  ( 1992)  25\u00ad26).  Symbouleutic oratory  (en  toi  demoi)  at  Leontinoi  is  mentioned  by  Pl.  Hp. mai. 128A. The  urban  layout  of  Leontinoi  is  known  in  some  detail from  the  description  given  by  Polyb. 7.6.  The  defensive sys- tem  of  the  city  is  among  the  best  preserved  in  Sicily.  The  C 6 circuit  wall  enclosed  the  San  Mauro  and  Metapiccola  hills and  the  central  valley  with  gates  at  either  end  (Rizza  ( 1978); for  chronology,  see  Tr\u00e9ziny  ( 1986)  187;  for  the  fortification of the  Leontinian  acropolises,  cf.  Diod. 14.58.1  (r 396)).  The C 6e(?)  outer  ashlar  circuit  wall  of  the  east  and  south  side  of Colle  San  Mauro  crossed  the  narrow  San  Mauro  valley  with a  pincer-like  gateway  (the  Syracusan  gate  of  Polybios)  and continued  along  the  west  and  south  sides  of  the  Metapiccola plateau.  The  defences  were  destroyed  by  Hippokrates c. 496/5,  reconstructed  and  extended  in  C 5m  and  destroyed in  C 5l  (cf.  Diod. 14.14.4;  Rizza  ( 1955)  281\u00ad88,  346\u00ad76;  cf. Dreher  ( 1986)).  The  north  gate  has  been  identified in the substantial  remains  of  a  C 5  ashlar  wall  in  isodomic  tech- nique,  and  part  of  the  foundation  of  a  round  tower  was found  in  the  northern  outlet  of  the  San  Mauro  valley (Martin  et al.( 1979)  585;  Spigo  ( 1980\u00ad81a)  794).  The  city  was walled  again  in  356/5  (Diod. 16.16.1)  and  besieged  in  342/1 (Diod. 16.72.2).  A  theatre  is  attested  in  C 4m  (during  the reign  of  Dion)  when  it  housed  a  meeting  of  the  assembly (Plut.  Dio 42.8\u00ad43.1). Archaeological  evidence  (habitation  structures  and abundant  C 8\u00adC7  ceramic  material)  has  revealed  a  first Greek  habitation  phase  on  the  Colle  San  Mauro.  There  are indications  of  an  initial  close  relationship  between  Greek and  Sikel  settlers  (Rizza  ( 1962),  ( 1978)).  The  C 7\u00adC6  settle- ment  phase  incorporated  also  the  Metapiccola  hill,  and  the total  extent  of  the  two  plateaux  with  the  central  valley  with- in  the  C 6  circuit  wall  was  about  40  ha.  There  are  remains  of terraced  houses  on  the  western  slope  of  the  Metapiccola  hill overlooking  the  San  Mauro  valley  (corroborating  the description  given  by  Polybios).  These  are  mainly Hellenistic,  but  they  have  a  C 7  phase  (Rizza  ( 1980\u00ad81) 767\u00ad68;  Spigo  ( 1980\u00ad81a)  793\u00ad94).  According  to  Thuc. 5.4.4, one  district  in  the  city  was  called  Phokaia.  Neapolis,  anoth- er  part  of  the  city,  was  attacked  by  Timoleon  in  342/1  (Diod. 16.72.1),  and  was  perhaps  originally  an  extra-urban  settle- ment  founded  by Hieron  in  476  to  house  the  inhabitants from  Katane  (no. 30)  and  Naxos  (no. 41)  (Diod. 11.49.2). According  to  Polyb. 7.6,  the  agora  was  situated  in  the  central valley,  as  were  the  law  courts,  dikasteria;  his  mention  of sanctuaries  on  the  city  plateaux  is  confirmed b y  the  archae- ological  evidence  (Barletta  ( 1983)  38\u00ad45).Extensive C 5s\u00adC4e cemeteries  lay  on  plateaux  north  of  the  city,  at  some  distance from  it,  whereas  tombs,  spanning  the  Archaic  and Hellenistic  periods,  lay  just  outside  the  south  gate  of  the  city along  the  road  leading  to  Syracuse  (Martin  et al.( 1979) 585\u00ad87;  Rizza  ( 1982)). From  the  evidence  of  the  coins,  Artemis  or  Demeter  (cf. Diod. 5.4.2)  and  Apollo  were  venerated  at  Leontinoi.  An external  collective  dedication  of  a  silver  phiale  at  Delos  is recorded in I.Delos 104.93  ( 366)  and  IG ii\u00b2  1643.21  (C 4m). The  earliest  coinage,  based  upon  the  Syracusan\u00adAttic standard,  was  issued  in  connection  with  Hieron's  settlement of  the  inhabitants  of  Katane  and  Naxos  at  Leontinoi  in  476 (C.  Boehringer  ( 1998)  43\u00ad44).  This  first series of tetradrachms  use  the  Syracusan  lambda  in  the  legend  and reveal  strong  Syracusan  stylistic  influence:  obv.quadriga and  Nike;  rev.  lion's  head  (a  pun  on  the  city's  name)  sur- rounded  by  four  grains  of  barley,  legend:  (C.  Boehringer  ( 1998)  pl. 10.1\u00ad5,  7\u00ad10,  etc.;  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 334\u00ad37).  A  second  series,  from  c. 466,  have  similar  obv.but with  a  running  lion  in  exergue  (as  in  the  Syracusan \"Demarateion\"  coinage);  rev.  female  head  (Artemis  or Demeter),  or  head  of  Apollo  wearing  laurel  wreath,  legend: ,  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 341\u00ad43; C.  Boehringer  ( 1998)  pls. 10.14\u00ad19,  11.30\u00ad32).A  third  series  of tetradrachms  belong  c. 450:  obv.  laureate  head  of  Apollo;  rev. lion  head  surrounded  by  barley  grains,  legend: , ,  (with  Chalkidian  lamb- da,  cf.  Johnston  ( 1975);  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 346\u00ad52; C.  Boehringer  ( 1998)  47,  pl. 11.33\u00ad37,  etc.).  Lower  denomina- tions  carry  related  types,  and  on  rev.  of  litrai  a  naked  youth (river-god  or  Apollo)  offering  a  libation  at  an  altar  (SNG Cop.  Sicily 353\u00ad57;  cf.  C.  Boehringer  ( 1998)  47\u00ad48  for  the change  in  the  system  of  denominations  with  refs.  to  plates). The  issue  of  tetradrachms  may  have  continued  until  c. 415 (C.  Boehringer  ( 1998)  50\u00ad51).  For  an  issue  of  hemidrachms possibly  indicating  collaboration  between  Leontinoi  and Katane  or  Leontinian  dependence  upon  Katane,  see  entry for  Katane.  Bronze  coins  were issued  from  c. 405  (SNG  Cop. Sicily 358\u00ad61;  C.  Boehringer  ( 1998)  51\u00ad52). Leontinoi  founded  the  colony  of  Euboia  (no. 15)  (Strabo 6.2.6)  at  an  unknown  site  in  the  Chalkidian  hinterland, 210 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo perhaps  as  early  as  C 8l  if  it  was  contemporaneous  with  the foundation  of  Mylai  (no. 38;  the  two  sites  are  coupled  by  Ps.-Skymnos  287\u00ad88);  Euboia  seems  to  have  been  a  settle- ment  of  some  importance  in  C 5f,  since  it  was  worthy  of being  relocated  by  Gelon  (Hdt. 7.156.3;  Camassa  ( 1989a)). 34.

IG v.1217  (C 5e): [ ]). Syracuse  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Hdt. 7.155.2;  Thuc. 6.65.3;  Ps.-Skylax 13)  and  in  the  political  sense (Hdt. 7.154.2;  Thuc. 6.36.2  and  Xen.  Hell. 1.1.28).  Its  politeia was  described  by  Aristotle  (Arist.  fr. 602.1).  Politeuesthai  is found  at  Arist.  Pol. 1312b9,polites  at  Arist.  Pol. 1303a38,politeu- ma  at  Arist.  Pol. 1303b26,  damosios  at  SEG 38  368  (c. 475),  and demos  at  Thuc. 6.35.1.  Astoi  referring  to  the  citizens  is  found at  Pind.  Pyth. 3.71  and  asty  referring  to  the  city  occurs  in  AG 13.15  (C 4e).  For  Patris,  see  Thuc. 6.68.8;  69.3  and  Isoc. 3.23. The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  on coins  from  C 6l  onwards  (infra);  the  external  collective use  is found  in  IvO 661  (C 6),  IGDS  no. 89  ( 485\u00ad470),  Hdt. 3.125.2 and  Thuc. 3.103.1.  The  external  individual  use  is  attested  in Egypt-Delta i694/511  (C 6\u00adC5),  IvO 266  (c. 480),  Thuc. 4.58, IG ii\u00b2  101.2  ( 372/1)  and  CID ii  4.i.40  ( 360). Syracuse  was  founded  by  Archias,  a  Heraklid  from Corinth  (no. 227;  Thuc. 6.3.2;  cf.  Strabo  8.6.22).According  to Strabo  6.2.4  and  Ps.-Skymnos  279\u00ad82  the  founders  included a  group  of  Dorians  who  had  come  to  found  Megara  (no. 36) but  fell  out  with  the  other  colonists  and  then  joined  the Corinthian  founders  of  Syracuse.  The  exact  date  of  the foundation,  as  well  as  its  date  relative  to  those  of  the  other early  colonies  in  Sicily,  is  much  debated:  according  to  Thuc. 6.3.1  (probably  based  on  Antiochos  of  Syracuse),  the  city  was founded  only  a  year  after  Naxos,  the  earliest  of  the  Sicilian colonies.  On  the  other  hand,  Ephor.  fr. 137a  (apud  Strabo 6.2.2)  stated  that  Naxos  (no. 41)  and  Megara  (no. 36)  were the  earliest  colonies,  and  the  unemended  text  of  Strabo  6.2.4 presupposes  that  Megara  was  founded  shortly  before Syracuse.  Thuc. 6.3.2  gives  the  foundation  date  as  733/2  (sup- ported  by  Eusebios,  cf.  B\u00e9rard  ( 1957)  120  with  refs.). However,  a date c.C 8m  is  indicated  by  Marmor  Parium (FGrHist 239)  A  31,  which  places  Archias  seven  generations after  Temenos  and  the  return  of  the  Herakleidai. The  name  of  the  territory  was  (Thuc. 6.52.2);  it  is  termed  at  Thuc. 7.42.6  and at 6.45. After  its  foundation,  Syracuse  quickly  expanded  its  territo- ry;  by C 8l  it  extended  as  far  to  the  south-west  as  Heloron (no. 18),  a  Syracusan  colony  founded  in  C 8l\u00adC7e;  by  664  it extended  inland  as  far  as  Akrai  (no. 10),  a  colony  founded  in that  year  (Thuc. 6.5.2);  by  C 7s  it  had  expanded  further  west- wards  to  Kasmenai  (no. 29),  a  colony  founded  in  644  (Thuc. 6.5.3).  To  the  north,  Thapsos  formed  the  border  with Megara  (no. 36);  Kamarina  (no. 28)  was  founded  in  598  on the  border  between  the  areas  of  influence of  Syracuse  and Gela  (Di  Vita  ( 1956),  ( 1987)).  Heloron,  Akrai  and  Kasmenai were  possibly  constituted  as  dependent  poleis  in  the  territo- ry  of  Syracuse  (see  the  respective  entries);  Kamarina  was also  in  one  way  or  another  dependent  on  Syracuse. Herodotos  reports  that  Kamarina  of  old  belonged  to Syracuse  ( 7.154.3),  and  Thucydides  refers  to  a  C 6m  apostasis from  Syracuse  by  Kamarina  ( 6.5.3).  The  C 7\u00adC6  Syracusan dominion  comprised  an  area  of  about  3,000\u00ad3,500  km \u00b2. During  the  C 5f  rule  of  the  Deinomenidai,  Syracuse incorporated  or  exercised  influence o ver  the  territories  of Kamarina,  Megara,  Leontinoi  and  Naxos;  by  440  all  native communities  were  ruled  by  Syracuse  (Diod. 12.29.2\u00ad4);  after Dionysios  I's  peace  with  Carthage  in  392,  Syracuse  ruled over  all  of  central  and  eastern  Sicily  (Karlsson  ( 1992)  map 2.a),  and  over  parts  of  South  Italy  including  Rhegion  (no. 68)  and  southern  Calabria. The  size  of  the  population  is  unknown,  and  it  must  have been  subject  to  constant  changes  due  to  the  many  reloca- tions  carried  out  during  the  Classical  period.  The  known incorporations  of  foreign  groups  into  the  Syracusan  citizen body  are  the  following:  ( 1)  Gelon  transplanted  and  granted Syracusan  citizenship  to  (a)  all  the  Kamarinaians,  (b)  half  of the  Geloans,  (c)  the  pachees  of  Megara,  (d)  the  pachees  of  the city  of  Euboia  (Hdt. 7.156.2\u00ad3);  (e)  he  also  granted  citizen- ship  to  more  than  10,000  mercenaries  (Diod. 11.72.3).  ( 2) After  the  congress  in  Gela  in  424,  the  dynatoi  of  Leontinoi were  relocated  to  Syracuse  and  were  granted  citizenship (Thuc. 5.4.2;  cf.  Xen.  Hell. 2.3.5).  ( 3)  Dionysios  I  enlarged  the citizen  body  by  enrolling  (a)  eleutheromenoi  as  neopolitai (Diod. 14.7.4);  (b)  the  inhabitants  of  Leontinoi,  who  were granted  citizenship  (Diod. 14.15.4);  (c)  the  inhabitants  of Italian  Kaulonia,  who  were  granted  citizenship  and  ateleia for  five y ears  (Diod. 14.106.3);  (d)  the  inhabitants  of  Italian Hipponion  (though  it  is  not  specified at Diod. 14.107.2  that these  received  citizenship).  ( 4)  Timoleon  (a)  made  the  peo- ple  of  Agyrion  (and  possibly  Kentoripa)  citizens  of  Syracuse (Diod. 16.82.4);  (b)  relocated  the  population  of  Leontinoi  to sikelia  225 Syracuse  (and  presumably  granted  them  citizenship, though  this  is  not  specified at Diod. 16.82.7);  (c)  settled  5,000 new  colonists  (Diod. 16.82.3;  cf.  Plut.  Tim. 23);  and  (d)  later several  myriads  more  ( 40,000  according  to Diod. 16.82.5; perhaps  60,000  according  to  Athanis  (FGrHist 562)  fr. 2;  cf. Talbert  ( 1974)  30).  In  the  Classical  period,  Syracuse  was  the largest  city  of  Sicily  (Hecat.  fr. 74;  Thuc. 7.58.4),in  extent  sec- ond  only  to  Akragas,  for  which  city  Diod. 13.84.3  (r 406)  gives the  figure of 20,000  citizens.  Dr\u00f6gem\u00fcller  ( 1969)  100  sug- gests  an  urban  population  of 40,000\u00ad45,000  for  Syracuse,  a guesstimate  which  may  be  a  little  on  the  high  side  in  view  of the  size  of  the  C 5  habitation  area,  c. 150  ha  (infra).  It  is  impos- sible  to  estimate  the  number  of  citizens  from  the  few  hints given  by  Thucydides  about  the  size  of  the  Syracusan  army  in 415  ( 6.67.2: \u00b5  ,  number  of  cavalry  given  as  1,200). Treaties  of  C 6m  with  Megara,  Enna  (Kasmenai?  cf.  the entry  for  Kasmenai)  and  presumably  Gela  are  strongly implied  by  Philistos  (FGrHist 556)  fr. 5,  who  refers  to a  war between  Syracuse  and  Kamarina  and  their  allies.  In  492  a treaty  with  Hippokrates  of  Gela  after  his  defeat  of  the Syracusans  came  about  through  arbitration  by  Corinth  (no. 227)  and  Korkyra  (no. 123)  (Hdt. 7.154.3;  cf.  Thuc. 6.5.3). Gelon's  victory  at  Himera  induced  nearly  all  the  cities  of Sicily  to  recognise  his  power  and  to  enter  into  a  symmachia with  him  (Diod. 11.26.2).  Syracuse  was  a  party  to  the  pan- Sicilian  agreement  concluded  at  the  Congress  of  Gela  in  424 by  which  it  ceded  Morgantina  (no. 37)  to  Kamarina  (no. 28) in  return  for  a  specified payment ( Thuc. 4.65.1).  During  the war  with  Leontinoi  (no. 33)  in  the  420s,Syracuse  had  treaties of  symmachia  with  the  Dorian  cities  of  Sicily  (except  for Kamarina)  and  with  Italian  Lokroi  (no. 59;  Thuc. 3.86.2\u00ad3) and  Lipara  (no. 34)  (Thuc. 3.88.3),  and  it  ruled  a  number  of Sikel  communities  kata  kratos  ( 103.1),  receiving  aparche from  them  (Thuc. 6.20.4). Numerous  Syracusan  exiles  are  on  record;  the  earliest  are the  Myletidai  mentioned  at  Thuc. 6.5.1  who  joined  the Zanklaians  (no. 51)  in  founding  Himera  (no. 24)  in  648. Exiles  are  attested  under  Deinomenid  rule  (Diod. 11.67.5), and  in  C 5m  several  sentences  of  exile  were  decreed  by  petal- ismos  (Diod. 11.87.4  (rC 5m)).  Exiles  collaborated  with  the Athenians  during  their  attack  (Thuc. 6.64.1).  A  collective sentence  of  exile  was  passed  on  the  strategoi  after  the  battle of  Kyzikos  (Xen.  Hell. 1.1.27).  In  406  a  general  recall  of  exiles was  voted  by  the  assembly  (Diod. 13.92.4\u00ad7). The  city  waged  numerous  wars;  the  earliest  known  is  the  C 6m  war  with  its  colony  Kamarina  in  which  both  were supported  by  allies  (Philistos  (FGrHist 556)  fr. 5).Apart  from the  military  victories  of  the  Deinomenidai,  the  most  spec- tacular  triumph  was  that  of  the  democracy  which,  eventual- ly  joined  by  all  Sicilian  poleis  except  Akragas  (no. 9)  (Thuc. 7.33,  58),  defeated  the  invading  Athenians  (Thuc. 6\u00ad7).  The Deinomenidai  raised  huge  armies,  but  these  can  hardly  have been  recruited  from  Syracuse  alone,  and  Deinomenid employment  of  mercenaries  was  extensive (Parke ( 1933) 10\u00ad13);  in  480  Gelon  raised  50,000  foot  and  5,000  horse (Diod. 11.21);  Thrasyboulos  raised  15,000  soldiers  (Diod. 11.67.7  (r 466))  and  controlled  a  navy  (Diod. 11.68.3  (r 466)). But  even  during  Deinomenid  rule  there  are  references  to civic  forces  proper  (Diod. 11.67.5:  politikai  dynameis).  In  471, 2,000  Syracusans  fell  in  battle  against  Akragas  (Diod. 11.53.5). In 439,  the  democracy  had  100  triremes  constructed (Diod. 12.30.1),  and  Thucydides  twice  refers  to  eighty  ships in  action  ( 7.22.1,  38.1).  Trierarchoi  are  attested  at  Xen.  Hell. 1.1.28  (cf.  IG ii\u00b2  105.37  ( 368/7)),  naval  commanders  at  Thuc. 7.25.1,  and  a  nauarchos  at  Diod. 11.88.4  (r 453).  Navies  are mentioned  also  at  e.g.  Thuc. 7.52.1  (seventy-six  ships);  Xen. Hell. 1.2.10  (twenty-five ships),  and  Diod. 13.13.1  (r 413)  (sev- enty-four  ships).  Hoplites  are  mentioned  at  Thuc. 6.67.2, (pandemei,  but  no  figure);  a  corps  of 600  epilektoi  is  attested for 461  (Diod. 11.76.2;  cf.  Thuc. 6.96.3  for 600  logades hoplites)  and  3,000  stratiotai  epilektoi  are  attested  for  409 (Diod. 13.59.1).  Akontistai  are  attested  at  Thuc. 6.67.2  and psiloi  at 6.52.2,  7.78.3.  Hippeis  are  mentioned  at  e.g.  Thuc. 6.67.2,where  they  are  said  to  number  not  less  than  1,200.The democracy  too  hired  mercenaries  (Thuc. 7.48.5).During  the democracy  the  board  of  strategoi  had  fifteen members (five from  each  tribe?),  but  during  the  Athenian  invasion  it  was reduced to  three strategoi  autokratores  (Thuc. 6.73.1), perhaps  one  from  each  tribe.  Strategoi  are  referred  to also  at e.g.  Thuc. 6.40.2;Xen.  Hell. 1.1.27;  IG ii\u00b2  105.36  ( 368/7);  and Diod. 11.91.2  (r 451).  Dionysios  I  in  405  raised 30,000  foot, 1,000  horse  and  50  ships  (Diod. 13.109.2). Sending  of  envoys  is  attested  at  Diod. 11.68.1  (r 466),  Thuc. 4.58  (Congress  of  Gela), 73.2,  75.2;  reception  of  envoys  is attested  at  Diod. 12.8.4  ( 446)  and  13.44.4  (r 410).  A  grant  of proxeny  by Delphi  (no. 177)  to  a  citizen  of  Syracuse  is  record- ed  by F.Delphes iii.1437  ( 331/30);  IG ii\u00b2  101  ( 373/2)  is  an  hon- orific decree for a citizen of  Syracuse  by Athens  (no. 361).The inhabitants  of  Antandros  (no. 767)  decreed  honorific citi- zenship  to  the  citizens  of  Syracuse  in  recognition  of  military help  (Xen.  Hell. 1.1.26).For  block  grants  of  Syracusan  citizen- ship,  see  above.  A  citizen  of  Syracuse  served  as  theorodokos  of Epidauros  (no. 348)  in  356/5  (IG iv\u00b2.195.i.39;  cf. ii.61). The  constitution  of  Syracuse  is  known almost  exclusively from  literary  sources,  and  the  only  relevant  inscriptions  are 226 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo a  few  dedications  found  in  Olympia  and  Delphi  (infra). Hippys  of  Rhegion  (FGrHist 554)  fr. 4  refers  to a  Pollis  Argeios describing  him  as  having  been  king  ( ) of Syracuse,  presumably  before  C 5  (Carlier  ( 1984)  467;  he  is described  as  tyrannos  in  Arist.  fr. 602.1).  However,  the  origi- nal  constitution  of  the  city  was  an  aristocracy  of  Gamoroi (Marmor  Parium  (FGrHist 239)  36  (rC 7l\u00adC6e);cf.also  IGDS no. 219  with  Dubois'  comm.;  Diod. 8.11),  who  ruled  both  the demos  (Hdt. 7.155.2)  and  a  serf  population  called  the Kyllyrioi  (ibid.  and  Arist.  fr. 603).  In  C 5e  the  Gamoroi  were expelled  by the  demos  and  retired  to  the  Syracusan  colony  of Kasmenai  (no. 29),  whence  they  were  brought  back  by Gelon,  to  whom  the  demos  handed  over  both  itself  and  the polis  (see  E.  W.  Robinson  ( 1997)  120\u00ad22  with  Arist.  Pol. 1302b31\u00ad32  for  democracy  at  Syracuse  at  this  stage).  Gelon moved  his  seat  from  Gela  (no. 17)  to  Syracuse,  and  from  that point  the  city  was  ruled  by  the  tyrant  dynasty  of  the Deinomenidai:  Gelon  ( 485\u00ad478/7;  see  Berve  ( 1967)  142\u00ad47), Hieron ( 478\u00ad466;  see  Berve  ( 1967)  147\u00ad52),  and Thrasyboulos  ( 466/5).  The  assembly  is  attested  during Gelon's  reign  (Diod. 11.26.6).The  tyranny  was  brought  to  an end  in  466/5,  when  the  Syracusans  revolted  against Thrasyboulos  (Arist.  Pol. 1312b10\u00ad16)  and  expelled  him  in collaboration  with  forces  from  Gela  (no. 17),  Akragas  (no. 9),  Selinous  (no. 44)  and  Himera  (no. 24)  (Diod. 11.67.5\u00ad68.5);  Arist.  Pol. 1312a10\u00ad11  suggests  that  the Deinomenidai  may  have  been  weakened  by  internal  rivalry. Democracy  was  now  reintroduced  (Arist.  Pol. 1316a32\u00ad33; Diod. 11.68.6),  and  at  least  some  of  the  population  reloca- tions  carried  out  by  Gelon  were  reversed  (Diod. 11.76.3\u00ad5; Strabo  6.2.3).  The  assembly  (ekklesia)  passed  a  decree (epsephisanto)  to  the  effect  that  only  archaioi  politai  were entitled  to  hold  office (Diod. 11.72.2).  Seven  thousand  of  the mercenaries  enfranchised  by Gelon  were thus  excluded from  office (Diod. 11.73.1),  though  they  remained  citizens (Arist.  Pol. 1303b1);  this  led  to  civil  war  (ibid.),  which  the mercenaries  lost  (Diod. 11.76.2;  cf.  Arist.  Pol. 1303a38ff).  A koinon  dogma  by  all  the  poleis  of  Sicily  then  reversed  all population  relocations  of  C 5f  and  assigned  Messana  (no. 51) to  the  mercenaries  (Diod. 11.76.5  (r 460)).  The  democracy lasted  until  the  tyranny  of  Dionysios  I  (for  the  democracy  in this  period,  see  Rutter  ( 2000));  during  the  democracy,  the working  of  the  assembly  is  attested  (Thuc. 6.32.3,  72.1;Diod. 11.72,  92.2;  cf.  Thuc. 6.35.  2  for  a  demou  prostates  and  Diod. 11.92.2  (r 451)  for  a  hint  of  the  procedure  of  probouleusis (Rutter  ( 2000)  145)),  and  foreign  policy  was  among  its responsibilities  (Thuc. 7.2.1);  magistracies  were originally filled b y election  (Diod. 11.73.1);  Thuc. 6.38.5  suggests  that  a law  specified a minimum age for office  holding.  The  proce- dure  of  petalismos  was  instituted  in  imitation  of  Athenian ostracism  to  prevent  the  appearance  of  new  tyrants;  it  led  to several  banishments,  but  had  to  be  revoked  because  it  alien- ated  the  upper  class  (Diod. 11.86\u00ad87;  Rutter  ( 2000)  146\u00ad48). After  the  victory  over  Athens  the  demos  assumed  still  greater power  (Arist.  Pol. 1304a27\u00ad29: \u00b5  ...    \u00b5 \u00b5).An important revision of  the  leg- islative  code  took  place  in  this  period  ( 412/11)  according  to Diodorus:  a  commission  of  nomothetai  presided  over  by Diokles  drew  up  the  so-called  Laws  of  Diokles  ( 13.35);  one reform  changed  the  procedure  for  appointing  magistrates from  election  to  sortition  ( 13.34.6).  Tyranny  returned  to Syracuse  with  Dionysios  I,  who  ruled  the  city  from  his appointment  as  strategos  autokrator  in 406  (Diod. 13.95.1)  to his  death  in  367  (see  further  Caven  ( 1990)).  Dionysios  pre- sumably  carried  out  a     \u00b5  to  consolidate  his grip  on  power (Diod. 14.7.4\u00ad5  (r 404)).  IG ii\u00b2  105.35\u00ad37 ( 368/7)  suggests  that  in  formal  terms  the  democratic  consti- tution  remained  in  existence  during  Dionysios'  reign  (cf.  Arist.  Oec. 1349a14,  26,  34  for  the  ekklesia  during  his reign).  After  his  death  several  tyrants  were  in  power  until  the intervention  of  Timoleon  in  344  put  an  end  to  a  period  of unrest  and  reintroduced  democracy  (see  Talbert  ( 1974)).  By the  later  C 4  the  city  was  ruled  by  \"the  oligarchy  of  the  Six Hundred\"  until  tyranny  returned  once  more  with Agathokles  (see  Wickert  in  RE \u00b2  iv. 2.  1518\u00ad23). Syracuse  experienced  perhaps  more  staseis  than  any  other Greek polis:  Berger  ( 1992)  34\u00ad49  studies  nineteen  cases  from the  Archaic  period  down  to  the  age  of  Timoleon.  One  stasis occurred  prior  to  the  foundation  of  Himera  in  648:  Thuc. 6.5.1  mentions  that  a  group  of  phygades  from  Syracuse    joined  the  Zanklaians  in  founding Himera  (Berger  ( 1992)  34).  Another  stasis  occurred  \"in ancient  times\"  and  developed  from  a  conflict between office-holders into a c onflict involving all citizens;  it  led  to  a change  in  the  constitution  (Arist.  Pol. 1303b20\u00ad26;  cf.  Berger ( 1992)  35).  Plut.  Mor. 825C,  relating  this  event,  mentions  a convened  to  solve  the  political  differences. One  of  the  earliest  known  public  enactments  is  a  law regulating  funerary  expenses  which  is  attested  during Gelon's  reign  (Diod. 11.38.2).  A  death  sentence  and  execu- tion  are  recorded  by  Diod. 11.91.2  (r 451);  confiscation of property  of  convicts  is  attested  by  Diod. 13.93.2  (r 406). An  eponymous  epipolos  is  attested  from  the  time  of Timoleon  onwards  (Diod. 16.70.6  (r 344)).  Arist.  Pol. 1303b23 has  a  general  reference  to archai\"in  ancient  times\";  the  boule is  attested  in  the  same  period  (by  Plut.  Mor. 825C  (supra)) sikelia  227 and  is  mentioned  in  IG ii\u00b2  105.36  ( 368/7).  Thucydides  pro- vides  some  general  references  to officials ( 7.73.3:    ;  7.73.4:    );  and  Diod. 11.92.2  (r 451)  has  a general  reference  to archontes  convening  the  assembly  (cf. 13.91.4  (r 406)).  IG ii\u00b2  105.35  ( 368/7)  also  provides  a  general reference  to archontes. A  system  of  phylai  is  attested  by  Thuc. 6.100.1;  it  served inter  alia  as  the  basis  for  the  army  organisation  (cf.  Plut.  Nic. 14.6).The  number  of  strategoi  indicates  that  there  were  three phylai;  they  were  presumably  the  traditional  Dorian  set  of Hylleis,  Dymanes  and  Pamphyloi  (Jones,  POAG 173\u00ad76).  A roster  of  all  Syracusan  citizens  as  organised  into  their  phylai was  stored  in  the  Olympieion  (Plut.  Nic. 14.6  (r 415),  see  229). Eisphora  is  attested  during  the  reign  of  Dionysios  I  (Arist. Pol. 1313b26ff,  Oec. 1349b6);  tribute  received  from  subjected natives  is  attested  in  Thuc. 6.20.4.According  to  Diod. 14.46.1 (r 398),  a  sizeable  body  of  Carthaginians  lived  in  Syracuse  as free  non-citizens. The  splendidly  celebrated  Panhellenic  victories  of  Hieron (Olympionikai 221,  234,  246;  Pind.  Ol. 1,  Pyth. 1\u00ad3;Bacchyl. Ep. 3\u00ad5;cf.Harrell  ( 2002))  were  not  the  only  victories  won  by Syracusans;  see  Olympionikai 51  ( 648),  219  ( 476),  248  ( 468), and 334  ( 420).  In  C 5f,  Astylos  of  Kroton  was  proclaimed  a Syrakosios  at  several  of  his  Olympic  victories  (Olympionikai 186\u00ad87),  and  Diod. 11.1.2  describes  him  as  such.  Dikon  of Kaulonia  must  have  been  among  the  Kaulonians  relocated to  Syracuse  by  Dionysios  I  (supra);  he  was  proclaimed  a Syrakosios  at  his  subsequent  victories  (Olympionikai 388\u00ad89)  and  is  described  as  such  by  Diod. 15.14.1  (cf. Stylianou  ( 1998)  ad  loc.).  For  a  C 4l  victor  in  the  Arkadian Lykaia,see IG  V. 2550.20. The  principal  divinities  of  Syracuse  seem  to  have  been Apollo,  Artemis,  Athena  and  Zeus  (Olympios),  to  all  of whom  temples  were  erected  in  the  Archaic  period  (infra). All  preserved  communal  dedications  are  of  C 5.  IG v.1217 is  presumably  a  C 5f  dedication  by  Syracuse  at  Sparta  (no. 345).  Whereas  Gelon  dedicated  spoils  from  the  battle  of Himera  ( 480)  at  Delphi  in  his  own  name  (ML  28  IGDS  no. 93;  cf.  Diod. 11.26.7;  for  the  structure:  Krumeich  ( 1991)), spoils  from  the  victory  at  Kyme  in  474  were  dedicated  joint- ly  at  Olympia  by  \u00b5   (ML 29  IGDS  no. 94;  cf.  Horos 1  ( 1983)  59; Yalouris  ( 1980)  14\u00ad15;  O.  Hansen  ( 1990);  Harrell  ( 2002)).  A treasury  was  built  at  Olympia  from  the  spoils  of  Himera (Paus. 6.19.7:  ;  for  the  structural remains:  Mallwitz  ( 1956\u00ad58));  in  it  were  housed  offerings  by,  presumably,  \"Gelon  and  the  Syracusans\"  (ibid.).  For  a dedication  at  Olympia  by  the  Syracusans  of  spoils  taken from  Akragas,  see  IGDS  no. 95;Yalouris  ( 1980)  16;  and  SEG 11 1212a  (cf.  SEG 15  252).  A  herald's  staff  was  also  dedicated  at Olympia  (SEG 38  368  (c. 475)).At  Delphi  a  treasury  was  con- structed  from  the  spoils  taken  from  the  defeated  Athenians (Paus. 10.11.5).  For  attempts  to  identify  both  an  Archaic  and a  Classical  treasury  of  the  Syracusans  in  the  architectural remains  at  Delphi,  see  Partida  ( 2000)  77\u00ad80,  135\u00ad46. The  town  was  founded  on  the  island  of  Ortygia,  an  ideal site  with  harbours  on  either  side:  in  the  east  the  Lakkios,  the Small  Harbour,  in  the  west  the  Great  Harbour  (for  a  geo- morphological  survey  of  settlement  and  territory,  see Mirisola  and  Polacco  ( 1996)).  Traces  of  Sikel  habitation  confirm the t radition  that  the  first G reek  settlers  ousted  the original  inhabitants  (Thuc. 6.3.2;  cf.  Martin  et al.( 1979) 655\u00ad57;  Frasca  ( 1983)). Archaeological  evidence  confirms a C 8s  foundation  date, and  C 8  habitation  remains  on  Ortygia  are  similar  to  con- temporary  remains  from  Megara  and  Naxos.  A  north\u00adsouth artery,  joining  the  major  sanctuaries,  and  with  orthogonally laid  out  stenopoi,  has  an  early  origin  (Pelagatti  ( 1982)  135\u00ad38; Voza ( 1984\u00ad85)  669\u00ad72,(1993\u00ad94)  1283\u00ad87).  The  city expanded  on  to  the  mainland,  the  coastal  plain  of Achradina,  from  C 8  (Voza  ( 1976\u00ad77)  551\u00ad53),  and  from C 7l\u00adC6e  a  narrow  isthmus  may  have  joined  Ortygia  with  its hinterland  (cf.  Strabo  1.3.18;  Kapit\u00e4n  ( 1967\u00ad68)).  The  main east-west  plateia  of  the  Achradina  originated  in  the  C 8\u00adC7 as  a  route  linking  Ortygia  with  the  Fusco  cemetery.  There  is C 5\u00adC4  evidence  of  orthogonal  town planning  (Voza ( 1976\u00ad77)  551\u00ad61,(1980\u00ad81)  681\u00ad82).  Ortygia  and  the  inner Achradina  comprised  an  area  of  c. 50  ha. The  C 4  extension  of  the  city  northwards--obliterating the  C 7\u00adC4  cemeteries  and  joining  the  areas  of  the  Achradina and  Neapolis--is probably t o  be  connected  with  the Timoleontic  settlement  of  new  colonists  (Diod. 16.82.3). The  periphery  of  the  city  was  taken  up  with  public  build- ings,  and  the  outskirts  of  the  Neapolis  by  theatres.  Tyche, located  to  the  east,  with  the  sanctuary  of  Tyche  and  the upper  plateau  of  Epipolai,  were  not  urbanised;  however, from  the  time  of  the  conflict w ith  Athens,  the  size  of  the  city was  about  150  ha,  and  in  the  Hellenistic  period  as  much  as 200  ha. The  island  of  Ortygia  and  the  coastal  plain  of  Achradina were  probably  fortified during the A rchaic  period  (implied by  the  mention  of  a  siege  by  Hippokrates  of  Gela  in  the  490s (Hdt. 7.154.2)  and  by  the  mention  of  walls  during  the  revolt against  Thrasyboulos  in  465  (Diod. 11.67.8;  see  also  11.73.1)); however,  the  archaeological  evidence  is  poor  (Dr\u00f6gem\u00fcller 228 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo ( 1969)  47\u00ad48,  55\u00ad56).  From  the  reign  of  Dionysios  I,  Ortygia served  as  a  strongly  fortified palace of  the  tyrants  (Diod. 14.7.2\u00ad4;  cf.  Hansen  and  Fischer-Hansen  ( 1994)  29;for remains  of  a  circuit  wall,  see  Martin  et al.( 1979)  666; Karlsson  ( 1992)  22\u00ad23),  a  palace  later  razed  to  the  ground  by Timoleon  (Diod. 16.70.4). The  plateau  of  Epipolai  was  probably  not  fortified before forts  were  laid  out  there  by  the  Athenians,  and  the  various counter  walls  and  cross  walls  were  raised  by  the  Syracusans during  the  war  of 414/13  (Thuc. 6.99\u00ad100,  7.4\u00ad7).  Dionysios I  fortified E pipolai,  first along the northern scarp (Diod. 14.18.2\u00ad8  (r 401)),  later  along  the  southern  scarp;  it  was  a  cir- cuit  wall  running  for  c. 9  km,  and  according  to Diod. 15.13.5 the  \"greatest  possessed  by  a  Greek  city\"  (Winter  ( 1971) 314\u00ad15;  Karlsson  ( 1992)  21,fig.  1,  23\u00ad38,  71).  The  west  gate  and the  Euryalos  fort  were probably  begun  by Dionysios,  but  the fully  developed  system  of  bastions  and  ditches  belong  to  the time  of  Timoleon,  with  the  final c omplex  from  C 3m (Winter  ( 1963);  Lawrence  ( 1979)  295\u00ad99). The  Archaic  agora  has  with  some  uncertainty  been  locat- ed  west  of  the  Athenaion  (modern  Piazza  del  Duomo) (Pelagatti  ( 1982)  136\u00ad37).  A  Classical  (and  Roman)  agora  is normally  taken  for  granted  in  the  southern  part  of  the Achradina  (modern  Piazza  Marconi/Foro  Siracusano),  but the  evidence  is  inconclusive (Bernab\u00f2  Brea  ( 1947);  Martin  et al.( 1979)  675). The  island  of  Ortygia  was  the  seat  of  at  least  three  major sanctuaries:  (a)  in  the  north,  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo,  with  a C 6e  Doric  temple  (Cultera  ( 1951);  Barletta  ( 1983)  72\u00ad78), with  a  history  going  back  to C 8;  (b)  the  so-called  C 6l  Ionic temple  is  located  on  the  elevated  central  part  of  the  island (G.V.  Gentili  ( 1967);  Barletta  ( 1983)  86\u00ad90);  it  is  uncertain  to whom  the  temple  was  dedicated  (G.  V.  Gentili  ( 1967)  80  sug- gests  Artemis);  it  was  not  completed,  perhaps  as  a  result  of  a revision  of  building  programmes  by  the  Deinomenidai, who  initiated  instead  the  construction  of  the  adjacent Athenaion;  (c)  the  Doric  temple  of  c. 480\u00ad470,now incorpo- rated  into  the  Renaissance  cathedral,  probably  built  by Gelon  to  replace  earlier  structures  (Orsi  ( 1919);  T.  Van Compernolle  ( 1989)  45\u00ad48,(1992)  51\u00ad55).  It  is  normally taken  for  granted  that  this  is  the  temple  dedicated  to  Athena (Cic.  Verr. 2.4.124\u00ad25),  and  according  to  Gras  ( 1990)  the  two temples  mentioned  in  Gelon's  treaty  with  the  Carthaginians (Diod. 11.26.2)  were  temples  of  Athena  in  Syracuse  and  in Himera.  Remains  from  the  temenos  include  traces  of  a stepped  altar,  parapet  and  architectural  fragments  in  Ionic style  (Barletta  ( 1983)  78\u00ad86).  Investigations  have  recently revealed  a  monumental  entrance  to  the  temenos  and evidence  of  a  C 7l\u00adC6e  naiskos(?),  altar  and  votive  pits  south of  the  Athenaion  (Voza  ( 1993\u00ad94)  1286\u00ad87).  A  sanctuary  of Olympian  Earth  was  located  on  the  tip  of  Ortygia  (Ath. 462B). Large  quantities  of  C 5l\u00adC4e  votive  deposits  (Martin  et al. ( 1979)  680\u00ad86;  Hinz  ( 1998)  102\u00ad7)  found  in  the  mainland Achradina  district  (modern  Piazza  Victoria)  provide  evi- dence  of  a  sanctuary  of  Demeter  and  Persephone,  perhaps the  one  embellished  with  two  temples  by  Gelon  after  the  vic- tory  at  Himera  in  480  (Diod. 11.26.7),  located  in  the  suburbs (proasteion)  and  destroyed  by  the  Carthaginians  in  396 (Diod. 14.70.4).  A  C 4  graffito w ith  a  dedication  to  Artemis Pheraia  points  to  a  cult  also  of  Artemis  in  this  sanctuary (Voza  ( 1973c)  106\u00ad7).  A  proasteion  is  not  compatible  with  a location  so  near  the  city  centre  according  to  Polacco  ( 1986) 23  n. 6,  who  suggests  that  the  Demeter  sanctuary  should rather  be  located  west  of  the  city  near  the  Olympieion.  An Apollo  sanctuary  was  located  near  the  theatre  in  the Temenites,  a  locality  on  the  outskirts  of  Achradina  (Thuc. 6.75.1,  7.75.1;  for  history  and  terminology:  Drogem\u00fcller ( 1969)  48  n. 36,  56\u00ad57).  The  sanctuary  is  now  tentatively identified w ith  the  remains  of  an  Archaic  temple  laid  out  on a  terrace  above  the  theatre  (Voza  ( 1993\u00ad94)  1289\u00ad90). After  the  fall  of  the  tyranny,  the  Syracusans  raised  a  statue of  Zeus  Eleutherios  and  founded  an  annual  festival  of eleutheria  (Diod. 11.72.2  with  Barrett  ( 1973)  30  n. 20;for a survey  of  other  festivals,  see  Trojani  in  Polacco  and  Anti ( 1981)  26\u00ad29).  The  major  suburban  cult  was  that  of  Zeus Olympios  west  of  the  river  Anapos  (Diod. 10.28.1  (r 491)). The  extant  remains  are  those  of  a  C 6m  gigantic  Doric  tem- ple,  with  evidence  of  a  C 7  predecessor  (Orsi  ( 1903);  Lissi ( 1958)).A  neighbouring  hamlet,  Polichene  at  Thuc. 7.4.6  but Polichne  at  Diod. 13.7.6,  was  fortified b y  the  Athenians  in 414.  A  suburban  Artemis  sanctuary  was  located  on  the north-east  outskirts  of  the  Epipolai  plateau,  at  the Hexapylon  gate  leading  northwards  to  Megara  and  Katane (Orsi  ( 1900)). Two  Greek  theatres  are  known  at  Syracuse.  ( 1)  The  larger is  situated  on  the  outskirts  of  the  Neapolis  district,  the Temenites,  on  the  slope  of  the  Epipolai.  In  its  main  construction  phase,  the  period  of  Hieron  II  ( 271\u00ad216),  it  had a  seating  capacity  of 14,000\u00ad17,000;  earlier  Archaic  or Classical  phases  have  not  been  demonstrated  convincingly (Polacco  and  Anti  ( 1981);  Polacco  ( 1990)).  However,  literary sources  attest  to  an  earlier  phase  of  this  theatre  at  least  from C 5e,  and  at  least  from  C 4m  it  was  built  of  stone  (Trojani  in Polacco  and  Anti  ( 1981)  41\u00ad43  with  refs.).  A  C 5s  architect  by the  name  of  Damokopos  was  associated  with  the  building  of sikelia  229 the  theatre  (cf.  Eust.  Od. 3.68),  and  Aischylos  produced  the Women  of  Aitna  for  Hieron  in  476  (see  Trojani  in  Polacco and  Anti  ( 1981)  34\u00ad36  with  refs.).  A  theatre  is  mentioned  by Diod. 13.94.1  (r 406),  and  was  used  as  ekklesiasterion  in 336 (Plut.  Tim. 34.3,  38.3).  ( 2)  About  100  m  to the  west,  rock  cut- tings  from  a  rectangular  structure  are  evidence  of  a  theatron with  rectangular  seating  and  a  cavea  with  a  diameter  of 27.5 m;  its  seating  capacity  was  about  1,000.  Its  chronology  is uncertain,  though  possibly  C 6l\u00adC5e  (G.  V.  Gentili  ( 1952); Dr\u00f6gem\u00fcller  ( 1969)  48\u00ad49);  according  to  Bernab\u00f2  Brea ( 1967)  99,the  interpretation  of  the  rectangular  structure  as  a predecessor  of  the  large  theatre is  quite  uncertain,  and  it cannot  be  excluded  that  this  building  served  as  the  meeting place  for  smaller  political  bodies  or  even  as  a  bouleuterion (Ginouv\u00e8s  ( 1972)  61\u00ad62;  Kolb  ( 1981)  92).  A  prison  is  attested in  Diod. 11.86.5  (rC 5m)  and  in  Plut.  Dio 57.3  (Hansen  ( 2002) 36\u00ad37). The  earliest,  Fusco,  cemetery  laid  out  east  of  the  city  was later  followed  by  an  arc  of  cemeteries  lying  around  the  city from  there  to  Tyche  in  the  west.  The  Archaic  cemeteries  in the  outer  Achradina  district  were  taken  over  by  habitation when  the  Classical  city  expanded,  pushing  the  Hellenistic cemeteries  further  out.  (For  a  survey  with  bibliography: Lanza  ( 1989);  add  Voza  ( 1993\u00ad94)  1292;  Shepherd  ( 1995) 52\u00ad56;  see  also  Frederiksen  ( 1999)). Minting  began  about  510/500  (C.  Boehringer  ( 1984\u00ad85) 122\u00ad24)  with  coins  on  the  Euboic\u00adAttic  standard  and  the tetradrachm  as  the  main  denomination:  obv.  quadriga,  leg- end: or ;  rev.  an  incuse  mill-sail design  with  a  female  head,  probably  the  nymph  Arethusa,  in the  centre  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 614;  standard  corpus  of Syracusan  coins  until  c. 425:  E.  Boehringer  ( 1929);  recent  sur- vey:  Rutter ( 1997)  114\u00ad16,  121\u00ad29).  The  lower  denomination is  a  didrachm  with  obv.  rider  and  side-horse;  rev.  similar  to the  tetradrachm  issue  (C.  Boehringer  ( 1984\u00ad85)  pl. 13.8\u00ad9). A  new  issue  was  probably  introduced  by  Gelon  c. 480  with basically  the  same  types  though  more  developed  in  design: the  charioteer  crowned  by  a  Nike,  and  Arethusa  on  the  rev. occupying  the  whole  field and surrounded b y  four  dolphins, legend: / (Rutter  ( 1997)  124  fig. 121;  SNG Cop.  Sicily 617\u00ad18;  SNG  Cop.  Suppl. 74;C5f  chronology, followed  here:  Rutter  ( 1998)).  Lower  denominations (didrachms  and  drachms):  obv.  horseman;  rev.  Arethusa (SNG.  Cop.  Sicily 615\u00ad16).  The  next  phase,  from  shortly before  470,  saw  a  rich  issue  of  tetradrachms  with  the  now canonical  types;  types  of  the  lower  denominations: drachms,  obv.  horseman,  rev.Arethusa;  obols,  obv.Arethusa, rev.  four-spoked  wheel  (with  between  the  spokes); litrai,  obv.  Arethusa,  legend: ,  rev.  Cuttlefish ( SNG Cop.  Sicily 620\u00ad34).  This  issue  culminated  in  a  series  of tetradrachms  and  an  innovative  issue  of  decadrachms,  now dated  470\u00adc.466  and  no  longer  connected  with  the  480 victory  of  Gelon  at  Himera  in  480:  obv.  as  above  but  with lion  in  exergue,  rev.  Arethusa  wearing  wreath,  legend: (Rutter  ( 1993),  ( 1998)  pl. 67.3\u00ad4).  From c. 460  the  obv.  type  carried  ketos  in  exergue  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 635\u00ad51).  The  Attic  weight  standard  and  the  obv.  design  came to  exert  great  influence on the c oinages  of  the  neigbouring cities  of  Gela,  Katane  and  Leontinoi  (Kraay  ( 1976)  210\u00ad11; Rutter ( 1998)). By C 5l,  tetradrachms  with  the  canonical  types  in  a  free style  were  produced  by  workshops  at  times  operating  with engravers  who  signed  their  dies  (Rutter  ( 1997)  144\u00ad46;  SNG Cop.  Sicily 666).  One  issue  of  the  die-cutter  Kimon  has  two letters  on  the  obv.: ,  possibly  a  reference  to a  cult  of Arethousa  Soteira  (Cahn  ( 1993)).  C 5l  also  saw  large  issues  of smaller  denominations;  of  special  interest  are  drachms  with rev.  type  showing  the  legendary  Sikanian  hero  Leukaspis (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 665,  673).  Before  400  the  standard  legend becomes  (Head,  HN \u00b2175;  SNG  Cop. Sicily 674,681,etc.).Bronze  and  gold  issues  belong  to  the  end of  C 5  and  should  be  seen  in  the  light  of  first the A thenian and  later  the  Carthaginian  invasions  under  Dionysios  I, with  high  denominations  in  silver,  decadrachms  signed  by engravers  (C.  Boehringer  ( 1993);  Rutter  ( 1997)  146\u00ad47, 154\u00ad58;  bronzes:  Morcom  ( 1998);  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 683\u00ad700, 720\u00ad22).100-litrai  electrum  coins  were  minted  by  Dionysios I  and  II:  obv.  Apollo;  rev.  Artemis,  legend: ; smaller  denominations  were  minted  as  well  (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 701\u00ad10).  Under  Timoleon  the  Corinthian  connection  is underlined  by  Corinthian-type  pegasi  minted  at  Syracuse (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 711\u00ad12);  later  the  Zeus  Eleutherios  and  the free  horse  types  become  common  for  the  cities  under Timoleon's hegemony  (Talbert  ( 1974)  182\u00ad90;  Karlsson ( 1995);  SNG  Cop.  Sicily 725). Syracuse  founded  several  colonies.  The  earliest  was Heloron  (no. 18),  founded  in  C 8l\u00adC7e.  Akrai  (no. 10)  was founded  in  664,  and  Kasmenai  (no. 29)  in  644  (Thuc. 6.5.2). Kamarina  (no. 28)  was  founded  c. 598  (Thuc. 6.5.3),  and within  a  few  decades  waged  war  on  its  metropolis  (Philistos (FGrHist 556)  fr. 5).  The  tyrant  Hieron  founded  the  city  of Aitna  (no. 8)  in  476  (Diod. 11.49.1\u00ad2);  and  Dionysios  I founded  Adranon  (no. 6)  (Diod. 14.37.5  (r 399)),  probably Adria  (no. 75),  possibly  Ankon  (no. 76),  certainly  Issa  (no. 81);  cf.  Stylianou  ( 1998)  ad 13.4\u00ad5  at  p. 196),  Lissos  (no. 82) (Diod. 15.13.4  (r  c. 385);  see  Stylianou  ( 1998)  ad  loc.),  and 230 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo Tyndaris  (no. 49).  Tauromenion  (no. 48)  too  may  possibly be  a  Dionysian  foundation. 48. ", "Mytistratos": "Identifier: 1119.5., (Mytiseratinos) Map  47.  Lat. 37.35,long. 14.00.  Size  of  territory:  ?

Mytistratos  is,  on  numismatic  evidence,  identified w ith Monte  Castellazzo  di  Marinopoli.  The  few  C 6\u00adC5  and  C 4 urban  remains,  including  a  circuit  wall  built  in  an  ashlar technique,  are  classified as G reek;  the  later  phase  with  evid- ence  of  formal  layout  is  probably  Timoleontic  (Fiorentini ( 1992)  303\u00ad4).  The  main  settlement  was  destroyed  in  C 3f, but  habitation  continued  on  an  adjoining  terrace.  Tombs  of the  investigated  cemetery  are  dated  to  C 4s  (Fiorentini  ( 1992) 302\u00ad5). Three  series  of  C 4  bronze  coins  are  attributed  to Mytistratos,  the  first two probably T imoleontic:  ( 1)  obv. head  of  Hephaistos,  legend: ;  rev.  free  horse;  ( 2)  obv. head  of  Hephaistos;  rev.  wreath  and  pellets,  legend:  (retrograde).  A  coin  of  the  latter  series  carries  the  legends (sc.

No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Nakona  a  polis,but it is  included  here  on  account  of  its  Classical  Greek-style coinage  (infra)  and  SEG 30  1119  (C 4\u00adC3),  a  Greek  decree  of Nakona  attesting  to  the  existence  of  a  citizen  body  (politai: l. 8),  a  boule  (l. 3),  and  an  assembly  (halia:l. 3),  etc.;  the  decree concerns  measures  taken  to restore  civic  order  after  a  period of  diaphora  (l. 10);  cf.  SEG 32  914  pp. 257\u00ad58.The  internal  col- lective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on  Classical  coins (infra)  as  well  as  in  SEG 30  1119.5.", "Aitna": "Identifier: 9. , II  is  to some  extent  dependent upon  the  attribution  to  Aitna  II  of  some  litrai  and,  especial- ly,  of  one  C 5m  tetradrachm  with  obv.

The  stylistic  affinity between this issue and  issues  of  Naxos  (no. 41)  and  Katane  (no. 30)  has  been seen  by some,  though  perhaps  not  entirely  convincingly,  as sikelia  185 evidence  of  a  C 5m  sympoliteia  between  these  cities  in  the  face  of  Syracusan  pressure  (Bombaci  and  Massa  ( 1990) 289).

He  surrendered  Naxos to  Dionysios  I,  who  subjected  the  city  to  an  exandrapodismos from  which  it  never  recovered;  the  chora  of  the  city  was handed  over  to  the  Sikels  (Diod. 14.15.2\u00ad3).A  C 5  genos  of  the Amphikleidai  organising  Naxian  theoriai  to  Delos  is  argued by Rutherford  ( 1998).Naxian  survivors  were  settled  at  Mylai (no. 38)  during  the  conflict between Dionysios,  Rhegion (no. 68)  and  Messana  (no. 51)  in  394  (Diod. 14.87.3;  cf. McKechnie  ( 1989)  37),  but  had  to  find new homes after the Messanians  took  Mylai  (ibid.).  In  358  the  Naxians  were  final- ly  settled  at  Tauromenion  (no. 48)  by  Andromachos  (Diod. 16.7.1);  Tauromenion  had  been  a  site  in  Naxian  territory (supra),  but  was  constituted  as  a  Greek  polis  only  in  C 4f. Andromachos  himself  was  its  leading  citizen  when Timoleon  arrived  in  Sicily  (Diod. 16.68.8;Plut.  Tim. 10.6\u00ad8); Marcellin,  Vita  Thucydidis 27  describes  him  as  exercising monarchia.  See  further  the  entry  for  Tauromenion.  Naxos itself,  however,  may  not  have  been  completely  abandoned: C 3  habitation  and  cult  activity  is  attested  there  (Pelagatti ( 1976\u00ad77)  544\u00ad45,(1980\u00ad81)  706). So  far,  the  only  evidence  of  civic  subdivisions  at  Naxos consists  of  inscriptions  on  two  clay  bullets  with  patronymi- ka,  implying  citizen  groups  possibly  matching  a  system  of phylai  or  phratriai.  The  chronology  of  the  inscriptions,  of C 5e  and  C 5l,  indicates  continuity  of  this  civic  organisation from  before  until  after  the  period  of  Hieron  (Cordano ( 1988)). The  cult  of  Dionysos  was  of  major  importance  at  Naxos, as  shown  by  the  coin  types  (Cutroni  Tusa  ( 1984\u00ad85)  296\u00ad97) and  the  number  of  Silenos  antefixes (Pelagatti ( 1977)  50\u00ad55). A  C 7l  cippus  carries  a  dedication  to  a  warrior-goddess  Eny\u00f2 (Guarducci  ( 1985)),  and  other  evidence  points  to  a  cult  of the  armed  Athena  (Lentini  ( 1993\u00ad94)  1016\u00ad17). Teisandros  of  Naxos  was  victorious  four  times  at  the Olympic  Games  (Olympionikai 94  ( 572)  with  refs.)  and achieved  the  same  number  of  Pythian  victories  (Paus. 6.13.8). The  town  of  Naxos  was  founded  on  a  low  coastal  penin- sula,  Capo  Schis\u00f2,  and  material  from  the  initial  C 8l  habita- tion  phase  extend  over  an  area  of  c. 10  ha  (Pelagatti  ( 1981) 295\u00ad97;  survey  in  Pelagatti  ( 1993);  bibliography  in  Lentini ( 1998)  99\u00ad100).  The  earliest  evidence  of  urban  layout  is  of C 7,  with  main  street  axes  linking  the  central  part  of  the  city westwards  with  sanctuaries,  eastwards  with  the  harbour, and  northwards  with  a  kerameikos  (Pelagatti  ( 1981) 297\u00ad302).  The  exceptional  character  of  habitation  near  the harbour  reveals  social  differentiation  (Lentini  ( 1984\u00ad85) 815\u00ad21). Though  a  stretch  of  a  Bronze  Age  fortification laid bare in the  Archaic  city  near  the  coast  (\"Castello  area\")  may  have been  reutilised  by  the  first G reek  settlers  (Lentini  ( 2001)  7), Naxos  was  apparently  not  fortified before C 6m  or  C 6l,prob- ably  as  a  result  of  the  threat  posed  by  the  expansion  of  Gela (no. 17)  in  north-eastern  Sicily  (Naxos  eventually  had  to accept  Geloan  hegemony  (Hdt. 7.154.2)).  The  walls,  built  in polygonal  masonry  with  the  use  of  local  black  lava  basalt rock,  are  preserved  on  three  sides:  along  the  river  Santa Venera  and  along  the  two  coastlines  of  the  peninsula;  north- wards  the  course  remains  to  be  clarified.  Gates  protected  by towers  were  located  in  alignment  with  streets  of  the  C 7  city which  covered  an  area  of  c. 35  ha.  The  earliest,  C 7l,  polygonal temenos  wall  of  the  sanctuary  south  of  the  city  may  have functioned  also  as  a  dyke  along  the  river  Santa  Severa (Pelagatti  ( 1964);  ( 1972);  Gras  ( 1998)).  Thuc. 4.25.8  attests  to the  existence  of  fortifications in  425  (Flensted-Jensen  ( 1995) 128);  the  fortifications w ere  destroyed  ( ) by Dionysios  in  403  (Diod. 14.15.2). The  conquest  of  the  city  by  Hippokrates  in  493  (Hdt. 7.154)  has  left  no  clear  traces  in  the  archaeological  record, apart  from  its  possible  reflection in a C 5e  structural  phase  of the  circuit  wall  (Lentini  ( 1984\u00ad85)  813). It  is  not  entirely  clear  from  Diod. 11.49.1\u00ad2  whether  he meant  to  imply  the  settlement  of  a  new  population  at  Naxos after  the  deportation  of  the  inhabitants  by Hieron  in  476, but  the  archaeological  evidence  attests  to  replanning  and resettlement.  The  Hieronian  city  was  laid  out  in  accordance with  a  unitary,  strictly  orthogonal  system  with  narrow  insu- lae  and  with  a  new  orientation  (Pelagatti  ( 1976\u00ad77)  537\u00ad43; Belvedere ( 1987)  with  refs.;  Lentini  ( 1998)  72\u00ad86). Rectangular  bases  found  at  the  crossing  of  plateia  and stenopoi  have  been  interpreted  as  horoi  marking  the  confines of  city  districts  (Pelagatti  ( 1977)  44\u00ad46)  or  as  altars (Spagnolo  ( 1991)  66  n. 78).  For  the  archaeological  evidence for  the  destruction  in  403  and  the  C 4e  history  of  Naxos,  see Lentini  ( 2002). An  agora  is  with  near  certainty  identified near the ancient harbour  in  the  north-eastern  corner  of  the  city  (Lentini ( 1993\u00ad94)  1010\u00ad12);  for  harbour  installations,  see  Pelagatti ( 1976\u00ad77)  538,  Lentini  ( 1993\u00ad94)  1009,  and  Blackman ( 1997\u00ad98). A  C 7l  sanctuary  in  the  south-west  corner  of  the  city,  near the  estuary  of  the  river  Santa  Venera,  at  first w ithin  the urban  area,  was  superseded  by  a  C 6s  hekatompedon  outside the  city  wall.  Altars,  bases  for  votive  stelai,  and  ovens  for ceramic  production  go  back  to  the  early  phase  of  the  sanctu- ary.  The  identification of  the  cult  as  that  of  Aphrodite,  as  yet sikelia  219 uncertain,  rests  upon  the  testimony  of  App.  B.  Civ. 5.109,but the  river  Onobalas  mentioned  by  Appian  is  normally  taken to  be  the  river  Serina  or  Selina  near  Taormina  and  not  the river  Santa  Venera  (cf.  Ziegler,  RE xvi.2.  2078;  Valenza  Mele ( 1977)  504\u00ad5).  Other  interpretations:  a  Heraion,  though with  no  clear  evidence  (pace  ibid. 505\u00ad6);  sanctuary  of Apollo  Archegetes  (Guarducci  ( 1985)),  but  this  was  situated outside  the  city  according  to  Thuc. 6.3.1;  cf.  HCT  ad  loc.A location  for  the  Apollo  sanctuary  near  the  harbour  on  the north  side  of  the  peninsula,  closer  to the  C 8  phase  city,  seems most  logical  (Pelagatti  ( 1978a)  138;Valenza  Mele  ( 1977)  505), a  location  also  supported  by  App.  B  Civ. 5.109,which  situates the  altar  of  Apollo  north  of  the  city  near  an  anchorage.  At least  four  C 7\u00adC4  small  urban  shrines  were  located  within the  Archaic  and  Classical  city  (Pelagatti  ( 1977)  46\u00ad48,(1981) 301,(1984\u00ad85)  680\u00ad83).  The  cults  of  these  are  uncertain.  An important  suburban  sanctuary  extended  over  a  vast  area west  of  the  city  across  the  river  Santa  Venera  (Lentini ( 1993\u00ad94)  1012\u00ad25,(1998)  87\u00ad96).  There  are  remains  of  two shrines,  altars  and  votive  deposits  (prime  period:  C 6m).The two  shrines  were  protected  by  peribolos  walls  or  embank- ments.  The  architectural  terracottas,  of  local  production, indicate  richly  decorated  buildings. The  C 8l\u00adC5f  cemetery  was  situated  north  of  the  city (Pelagatti  ( 1980\u00ad81)  697\u00ad701;  Lentini  ( 1986)).  The  C 5  ceme- tery  is  located  west  of  the  city,  on  the  other  side  of  the  river Santa  Venera,  south-west  of  the  sanctuary  (Pelagatti ( 1976\u00ad77)  544). Naxos  minted  coins  from  c. 525  on  the  Chalkidian\u00ad Euboian  standard  (Cahn  ( 1944)).  The  main  denomin- ation  is  the  drachm,  the  smaller  denomination  the  obol (litrai)  (C.

", "Mylai": "Identifier: 39. , (Mylaios) Map  47.  Lat. 38.15,  long  15.15.  Size  of territory: 2.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is  , (Hecat.  fr. 79  Steph.  Byz. 461.6;  Thuc. 3.90.2).  The  city-ethnic  is (SEG 24  313\u00ad14  (C 5e);  Diod. 12.59.5). Mylai  is  described  as  a   `  ...  \u00b5  in Ps.-Skylax 13  (cf.  Hansen  ( 2000)  198);  it  is  also  called  a  polis in  the  urban  sense  at  Diod. 14.87.3  (r 394)  and  by  Ps.- Skymnos  288  (r  time  of  foundation).  The  external  collective use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  in  SEG 24  313\u00ad14  (C 5e)  and  in Diod. 12.54.4  (r 427). Even  so,  Mylai  is  often  thought  not  to  have  been  been  a polis  but  simply  a  fortified outpost ( phrourion)  of Zankle/Messana  (no. 51;  Ziegler  in  RE xvi:  1042;  Bernab\u00f2 Brea  and  Cavalier  ( 1992)  118;  Dubois  in  IGDS  ad  no. 5). Certainly,  relations  between  Mylai  and  Zankle/Messana seem  to  have  been  close.  (a)  Mylai  was  founded  by  Zankle (Ps.-Skymnos  287;  cf.  Strabo  6.2.6)  in  716  (Euseb.  Chron.  sub Ol. 16.1).  (b)  Thuc. 3.90.2  describes  it  as  and  states  that          .  (c)  The  term phrourion  is  applied  to  the  site  in  Diod. 12.54.5  bis  (r 427)  and 19.65.3  (r 315).  Finally  (d),  Theophr.  Hist.  pl. 8.2.8  uses  the phrase          \u00b5 ,  which  seems  to  indicate  that  Mylai  was  conceived of  as  situated  in  the  territory  of  Messana  (so  Ziegler  in  RE xvi.  1042). However,  the  following  should  be  noted.  Re  (a),  the  report on  the  foundation  does  not  state  the  purpose  of  the  founda- tion  and  there  is  no  compelling  a  priori  reason  why  Mylai should  not  have  been  planned  as  an  ordinary  colony  and thus  as  a  polis;  but  even  if  it  is  assumed  that  it  was  planned  as a  military  outpost,  the  examples  of  Kasmenai  (no. 29)  and Akrai  (no. 10)  indicate  that  this  need  not  militate  against  its being  a  polis  (cf.  Hansen  ( 1997a)  36),  although  then  presum- ably  a  dependent  polis.  Much  more  importantly,  our  earliest sources  on  Mylai  are  two  dedications  of  spoils  by  Messana (no. 51)  at  Olympia  that  are  inscribed   (SEG 24  313\u00ad14  (C 5e));  this  of  course  indicates military  confrontation(s)  between  Mylai  and  Messana  and that  \"Mylai,  at  least  before  being  defeated,  had  been  a  self- governing  community  and  undoubtedly  a  polis\"  (Hansen ( 2000)  198);  see  also  below  on  colonisation.  Re  (b  c),  the application  of  the  term phrourion  does  not  exclude  polis  sta- tus  for  Mylai  (cf.  Thuc. 8.62.3  describing  the  uncontroversial polis  of  Sestos  (no. 672)  as  a  phrourion),  and  in  fact  Diodorus varies  between  phrourion  ( 12.54.5,  19.65.3)  and  polis  ( 14.87.3). The  fact  that  Mylai  in  426  was  garrisoned  by  Messanian forces  indicates  close  military  collaboration  and  suggests again  that  Mylai  was  a  dependency  of  Messana,  as  does Thucydides'  phrase    .  Describing  the events  of 426,however,Diod.12.54.2  classifies the inhabitants of  Mylai  as  not  as  ,  and  this  indicates that  it  was  a  community  with  an  identity  of  its  own,  distinct from  that  of  Messana.  Re  (d),  the  fact  that  Mylai  may  have been  conceived  of  as  situated  in  Messanian  territory  does  not mean  that  it  cannot  have  been  a  polis,  since  small  poleis  situ- ated  inside  the  territory of  larger  poleis  are  a  well-attested phenomenon  (Hansen  ( 1997a)  31).  If  Mylai  was  thus  situat- ed,  this  may  help  to  explain  Thucydides'  statement  ( 6.62.2) that  Himera  (no. 24)  was  the  only  Greek polis  on  the Tyrrhenian  coast  of  Sicily  (a  statement  which  in  any  case  may refer  primarily  to north-western  Sicily),  since  a  dependent polis  inside  the  territory of  another  polis  may  have  counted  as a  polis  only  in  internal  matters  (Hansen  ( 1995)  73\u00ad74).  To conclude,  the  Messanian  dedications  at  Olympia  indicate 216 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo that  Mylai  was  a  polis  in  C 5e,  and  Ps.-Skylax  that  it  was  still  a polis  in  C 4;  it  seems  to  have  been  a  dependent  polis  of Zankle/Messana,  and  it  is  conceivable  that  its  political  status may  have  been  subject  to  change  (Hansen  ( 2000)  198). Although  presumably  situated  in  the  territory of Zankle/Messana  (supra),  the  existence  of  a  separate  name--    (Polyb. 1.23.7)  or     (Polyb. 1.9.7)--indicates that at least b y  C 3m,  and  presum- ably  before,  Mylai  had  its  own  territory  (Hansen  ( 2000) 198).  The  size  of  Mylai's  territory  is  uncertain,  but  the  fertile coastal  plain  east  and  west  of  the  city  comprises  about  75 km \u00b2.  The  border  with  Zankle  may  have  been  defined b y  the famous  sanctuary  of  Artemis  Phakelitis  located  somewhere east  of  Mylai  (Saporetti  ( 1979);  Bernab\u00f2  Brea  and  Cavalier ( 1992)  116;  cf.  also  the  entry  for  Zankle).  To  the  west,  Mylai bordered  upon  the  territory of  Tyndaris  from  396  (cf.  Strabo 6.1.2),  and  to  the  south-west  upon  the  territory  of  the indigenous  city  of  Longane. In 427  the  Athenians  occupied  Mylai,  forcing  upon  it  an alliance  against  Messana  (Thuc. 3.90.3:  \u00b5).  In  394  the  Rhegians  settled  at  Mylai  those Naxians  and  Katanaians  who  had  survived  Dionysios  I's exandrapodismos  of  their  cities  in  403  (Diod. 14.87.1).  Later the  same  year  the  city  was  captured  by  Messana,  and  the Naxians  (and  presumably  the  Katanaians)  were  allowed  to leave  hypospondoi  (Diod. 14.87.3). The  town of  Mylai  was  situated  on  a  high  promontory, the  acropolis  (mentioned  at  Thuc. 3.90.3)  crowning  the 6.5  km-long  alluvial  peninsula  joining  it  to  the  inland  plain. The  settlement  was  founded  on  an  indigenous  site.  The original  Greek  settlement  seems  to  have  occupied  only  the upper  plateau,  though  in  a  later  period  habitation  may  have progressed  to  the  slopes  below,  closer  to  the  sea  and  the  har- bour  known  from  the  sources  (Ps.-Skylax  13).  There  are  no structural  traces  of  the  Archaic  or  Classical  city,  nor  of  the defences  mentioned  by  Thuc. 3.90.3  ( \u00b5,  cf.  the poliorkia  at  Diod. 12.54.4  (r 427)).  Mylai  was  still  fortified in C 4l  (Diod. 19.65.3  (r 315)).  The  cemetery  located  along  the principal  route  across  the  isthmus  took  over  the  site  of  the indigenous,  Bronze  Age  settlement.  The  earliest  tombs  are  of C 8l,thus  confirming the E usebian  date  ( 716)  for  the  founda- tion;  this  cemetery  continued  in  use  also  in  the  late  Archaic period  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea  and  Cavalier  ( 1959),  ( 1992)). According  to  Strabo,  \"the  Zanklaians  in  Mylai\"  founded Himera  ( 6.2.6:  `\u00b5         (r648)).If  this  means  that  Mylai  was  the  metrop- olis  of  Himera  (no. 24),  it  will  support  the  suggestion  that Mylai  itself  was  a  polis  in  the  Archaic  period. 39.

Engyon  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  and  political  (cf. \u00b5) senses at Diod.  16.72.4  (r 342/1)  in  a  passage which  also  uses  the  collective city-ethnic  (cf. 16.72.6).  In 342/1,  the  city  was  ruled  by  the  tyrant  Leptines,  who  was, however,  deposed  when  Timoleon  restored  the  autonomia of  Engyon  (Diod. 16.72.3\u00ad5). According  to Diod. 4.79.7,  the  famous  sanctuary  of  the Meteres  at  Engyon  was  of  Cretan  origin  (Manganaro  ( 1996c) 130  n. 13  with  refs.),  perhaps  an  indication  that  Greek  identi- ty  was  claimed  for  the  city  (infra). The  location  of  Engyon  is  uncertain,  though  we  are  told that  the  neighbouring  city  was  Agyrion  (no. 7),  located  100 stades  away  (Diod. 4.80.5).  Manganaro  has,  on  the  basis  of Hellenistic  inscriptions  ( []  '[  ]?) on bullets found  at  Troina,  suggested  this  as  the  site  of  Engyon,  and  the possible  attestation  of  a  civic  organisation  with  phratriai  is of  some  importance  as  an  indication  of  Greek  identity (Manganaro  ( 1964b),  ( 1996c)  130;  contra  Manni  ( 1976b) 606\u00ad7). At  Troina,  the  archaeological  remains  of  a  circuit  wall  and the  evidence  from  tombs  do  not  antedate  C 4m;  there  is  no evidence  of  an  original  Sikel  settlement.  However,  the  ident- ification of  Troina  with  Engyon  (accepted  by  Barr.)  cannot be  considered  absolutely  certain  (Militello  ( 1961);  Bejor ( 1989a)). 15.Euboia  (Euboeus)  Map  47.

Camassa  ( 1989a)  391\u00ad92:  \"uno  specifico r iferi- mento  agli  abitanti  del  centro  [i.e.  the  city  of  Euboia]  e  non  .  .  .  una  designazione  dei  coloni  d'ascendenza  euboica  in Sicilia\").  The  site  of  Euboia  is  unidentified,  but  it  was  pre- sumably  located  somewhere  in  the  hinterland  of  Leontinoi (no. 33)  where  the  presence  of  Chalkidian  Greeks  is  well  doc- umented  (Procelli  ( 1989)).  The  city  has  been  tentatively  iden- tified w ith  different  modern  towns  and  localities  (cf.  Camassa ( 1989a)  392),  most  recently  with  the  site  of  Monte  San  Mauro near  Caltagirone  (Frasca  ( 1997)).  Barr.  (following  Manni ( 1981))  suggests  a  location  at  the  ACH  site  at  Licodia  Euboia. The  only  Classical  source  to  mention  Euboia  is  Hdt. 7.156.3,  which  reports  that  Gelon  subjected  it  to  the  same treatment  as  Megara,  i.e.  the  pacheis  received  citizenship  at Syracuse  (no. 47)  while  the  demos  was  sold  into  slavery;  this ought  to  imply  a  Euboian  population  socially  differentiated into  pacheis  and  demos,  and  since  the  other  communities relocated  by  Gelon  were  certainly  poleis--viz.  Kamarina  (no. 28)  and  Megara  (no. 36)--the presumption is that E uboia was  a  polis  as  well  (cf.  Seibert  ( 1979)  226,  228).  Strabo  10.1.15 also  reports  Gelon's  relocation  of  the  city  and  implies  that  it meant  a  change  of  status  for  Euboia:  it  became  a  Syracusan phrourion,  and  the  inference  is  that  it  was  a  polis  prior  to that ( ...     ,   ;  cf.  the  entry  for  Leontinoi,  which  became  a phrourion  of  Syracuse  in  the  later  420s).  Euboia  is  called  a polis  by  Ps.-Skymnos  287  in  reference  to the  time  of  founda- tion.  The  external  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  at Hdt. 7.156.3. sikelia  191 Only  two  events  of  Euboian  history  are  known:  its  foun- dation  and  its  destruction.  It  was  founded  by  Leontinoi  (no. 33)  (Strabo  6.2.6).  The  date  of  the  foundation  is  unknown and  must  be  inferred  from  the  context  in  which  the  literary sources  mention  it:  Strabo  6.2.6  discusses  its  foundation together  with  the  foundations  of  Himera  (no. 24),  Kallipolis (no. 27)  and  Selinous  (no. 44),  which  may  suggest  a  C 7  date for  the  foundation;  however,  Ps.-Skymnos  287\u00ad88  treats  the foundation  alongside  that  of  Mylai,  so  a  C 8l  date  cannot  be entirely  excluded.  Euboia's existence  as  a  polis  ended  when c. 485\u00ad483  Gelon  sold  its  demos  into  slavery  and  relocated  the pacheis  to  Syracuse  (Hdt. 7.156.3;  chronology:  Dunbabin ( 1948)  416);  after  that  it  was  a  Syracusan  phrourion  (Strabo 10.1.15). 16.

Ps.-Skylax 13  lists  Tauromenion  under  the  heading  ` ,  side  by  side  with  Naxos  (no. 41), although  the  two  cities  did  not  exist  contemporaneously; this  presumably  means  that  the  text  has  been  compiled  from sources  of  different  dates.  Diod. 14.59.3  calls  it  a  polis  in  the urban  sense,  but  the  reference  is  to the  year  396,  at  which time  the  site  was  not  yet  a  Greek  city  (see  below  on  the  foun- dation).  As  a  Hellenic  community  it  is  called  a  polis  in  the urban  sense  at  Diod. 16.7.1  (r 358)  and  in  the  political  sense  at Diod. 16.68.8  (r 344). The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on C 4  coins  (infra);  the  external  collective  use  is  found  in I.Delos 103.60  ( 372\u00ad367;  cf.  IG ii\u00b2  1638B.43),Diod.16.68.9  and Plut.  Tim. 11.4  (r 344);  the  external  individual  use  is  found  in Diod. 16.7.1  (r 358),  and  is  often  applied  to  the  historian Timaios  (cf.  FGrHist 566,  tt. 1,  4e,  5,  13);  see  also  IdiCos  ED 52A.13  (C 3). Tauromenion  became  a  Greek  polis  in  C 4f.  At  16.7.1, Diodorus  describes  what  would  appear  to  be  the  founda- tion:  in  358  Andromachos,  the  father  of  the  historian Timaios,  gathered  the  remnants  of  the  Naxians  whose  city had  been  destroyed  by  Dionysios  I  in  403  (Diod. 14.15.2\u00ad3), had  them  settled  on  the  Monte  Tauro  above  the  abandoned site  of  Naxos,  and  named  the  place  Tauromenion.  The  city soon  became  populous  and  wealthy.  There  is  reason  to believe,  however,  that  this  was  not  the  point  at  which  the Greek polis  of  Tauromenion  originally  came  into  being:  not only  is  Andromachos  described  as  Tauromenites  at  this  very point,  but,  much  more  importantly,  a  communal  dedication by  the  Tauromenitai  at  Delos  is  listed  in  Delian  inventories which  antedate  by  several  years  the  event  described  by Diodorus:  see  I.Delos 101.40  ( 372\u00ad367),  103.60  with Rutherford  ( 1998)  83,  and  this  indicates  that  the  polis  existed prior  to the  enfranchisement  of  the  Naxians  and  prior  to 364 (ibid.).  Nor  was  the  site  created  ab  novo  in 358,  at  least  not according  to  Diodorus  himself,  who  gives  the  following information  on  Tauromenion  prior  to 358:in  403,  upon  his destruction  of  Naxos,  Dionysios  handed  its  chora  over  to  the neighbouring  Sikels  ( 14.15.3);  in  396  the  Carthaginian Himilkon  induced  the  Sikels  to  create  a  fortified c entre  on the  Monte  Tauro,  a  site  which  they  named  Tauromenion  (but see  Bennet  ( 1977)  85)  and  which  Diodorus  describes  by  the term polis  ( 14.57.2);  in  394/3  Dionysios  attempted  without success  to  take  the  Sikel  polis  of  Tauromenion  by siege ( 14.87.4\u00ad88.4);  however,  by  the  treaty  in  392  between Dionysios  and  Carthage,  Tauromenion  was  assigned  to Dionysios,  who  proceeded  to  expel  most  of  the  Sikels  and settle  selected  mercenaries  at  the  site  ( 14.96.4).  If  this Dionysian  settlement  of  mercenaries  was  not  in  fact  the foundation  of  the  Greek  polis  (it  may  have  struck  coins, infra),  then  the  polis  must  have  come  into  being  after  this event  and  before  the  inscribing  of  the  Delian  inventories c. 374\u00ad367.  The  reason  why  Diodorus  seems  to  think  of  the settlement  of  Naxians  at  Tauromenion  in  358  as  the  founda- tion  of  the  city  may  be  that  he  drew  his  information  from Timaios,  the  son  of  Andromachos,  who  may  have  described the  event  \"in  maiorem  gloriam  patris\"  (so  Ziegler  ( 1934)  30; cf.  Bennet  ( 1977)  86\u00ad87;  Timaios  was  reputedly  partial  to  his father,  see  Marcellin.  Vita  Thucydidis 27).  So  as  a  Greek  polis Tauromenion  was  a  C 4f  foundation;  however,  there  is  some archaeological  evidence  of  C 7  Greek  presence  at  the  site;  Ps.- Skymnos  289  lists  Tauromenion,  with  Himera  (no. 24), among  the  Chalkidian  foundations,  thus  implying  an  early date,  but  this  is  most  probably  an  error.  Strabo  6.2.3  lists Tauromenion  as  a  city  founded  by  the  Zanklaians  of  Hybla; the  passage  is  confused,  but  may  be  explained  on  the assumption  that  Zanklaians  (  Messanians)  who  had  been ousted  from  Messana  in  396  by  Himilkon  (Diod. 14.58.3) took  refuge  in  Aitnaian  Hybla  (although  there  is  no  direct evidence  for  this),  and  later  participated  in  the  foundation of  Tauromenion  (Strabo  6.2.3;  cf.  Consolo  Langher  ( 1996c) 542  for  this  suggestion).  For  a  survey  of  research and  inter- pretations,  see  Ziegler  ( 1934),  Bennet  ( 1977)  84,and  Consolo Langher  ( 1996c). The  size  of  the  territory  is  unknown.  It  may  have remained  Sikel  although  under  Greek  suzerainty  (Diod. 14.96.4;  cf.  Consolo  Langher  ( 1996c)  538  n. 6).  By  C 4l  there were  a  number  of  phrouria  in  the  territory  (Polyaen. 5.3.6;  cf. Steph.  Byz. 168.15). Not  much  is  known  about  the  institutions  and  political structure  of  C 4  Tauromenion.  When  Timoleon  arrived  at Tauromenion,  its  leading  citizen  was  Andromachos:  Diod. 16.68.8  describes  him  as      \u00b5,  and Plut.  Tim. 10.6\u00ad8  as       ; Marcellin.  Vita  Thucydidis 27  describes  him  as  exercising monarchia;  he  may,  then,  have  been  a  tyrant  (so  Talbert sikelia  231 ( 1974)  114\u00ad15)  and  if  so,  his  enfranchisement  of  the  Naxians (supra)  joins  the  long  list  of  tyrannical  population  transfers in  Sicilian  history.  Plut.  Tim. 10.7  says  that  he  led  the  politai \u00b5\u00b5  , but  if  the  ultimate  source  for  that statement  is  Timaios,  its  reliability  is  questionable;  it  is  at least  possible  that  some  Tauromenitai  left  the  city  in  opposi- tion  to  Andromachos  (cf.  Jacoby's  comm.  ad  Timaios (FGrHist 566)  fr. 33).The  existence  of  a  civic  army  is  suggest- ed  by Diod. 16.7.9  (r 344),  and  reception  of  envoys  is  attested by Plut.  Tim. 11.2  (r 344).  An  external  communal  dedication at  Delos  is  attested  by  I.Delos 103.60  ( 372\u00ad367). The  site  of  the  Sikel,  later  Greek  city  of  Tauromenion north  of  Naxos,  and  originally  in  the  chora  of  this  city  (it  had been  conquered  by  force  at  the  foundation  of  Naxos;  cf. Diod. 14.88.1),  was  well  chosen:  it  is  an  easily  defendable  site on  the  Monte  Tauro, 200\u00ad300  m  above  sea  level. The  urban  remains  are  mainly  Hellenistic  and  Roman. The  Greek  city  was  undoubtedly  fortified:  remains  of  a  cir- cuit  wall  are  extant  near  the  agora  (cf.  also  Freeman ( 1891\u00ad94)  iv. 109\u00ad10).  The  settlement  was  fortified already during  the  Sikel  C 4e  phase  according  to Diod. 14.87.4\u00ad88.4. The  settlement  comprises  c. 65  ha,  excluding  the  upper  part of  Monte  Tauro  above  the  city  (perhaps  a  fortified acropo- lis).  C 7\u00adC5l  Greek  presence  has  been  revealed  by  sherds found  in  the  area  of  the  agora,  spanning  the  period  from  the early  history  of  Naxos  until  its  destruction  by  Dionysios  in 403  (Bacci  ( 1980\u00ad81b)  742,(1997)).  C 6  architectural  frag- ments  of  Naxian  type  attest  to  an  extra-urban  sanctuary  in the  territory  of  Naxos  (Bacci  ( 1984\u00ad85)  722\u00ad23),  situated within  the  later  city  in  what  was  to  become  the  agora  of Tauromenion  on  the  plateau  west  of  the  theatre.  Epigraphic and  architectural  evidence,  and  similarities  with  the  theatre at  Syracuse,  point  to  a  C 3e  Greek  origin  for  the  famous Roman  theatre  (Polacco  ( 1982)  438\u00ad40).  Tauromenion  may have  had  a  C 4  overall  urban  scheme  of  habitation  and  pub- lic  structures  laid  out  on  terraces  along  the  slopes  of  Monte Tauro  (Bacci  ( 1997)). A  rare  silver  dilitron  with  Naxian  types:  obv.  laureate  head of  Apollo  (Archagetes);  rev.  squatting  Silenos;  legend: [] (Cahn (1944)  146  no. 149),  has  been attributed  to the  mercenaries  of  Dionysios' 392  settlement, although  the  issue  may  have  been  made  only  after  the  death of  Dionysios  (S.  Calderone  ( 1956);  followed  by  Consolo Langher  ( 1996c)  538\u00ad39).  A  large  bronze  coinage  in  three denominations  was  struck  in  the  reign  of  Andromachos c. 357\u00ad344.  Types:  obv.  head  of  Apollo  Archagetes  laureate, legend: ;  rev.  bull  walking  or  galloping, at  times  man-headed,  or  bull-head  protome,  legend: ,  ,  with  variations (SNG  Cop.  Sicily 916\u00ad20).  The  type  and  legend  of  Apollo Archagetes  (cf.  App.  B  Civ. 5.12.109)  testify  to  Tauromenion's ambition  to  be  the  heir  of  Naxos  (for  the  period  of Timoleon,  see  Brugnone  ( 1980)  279).  The  type  of  Apollo, influenced b y  a  type  known  from  earlier  issues  of  the Chalkidic  cities,  is  crucial  testimony  to  the  importance  of the  Tauromenian  mint  (Consolo  Langher  ( 1996c)  550\u00ad55). The  issues  of  the  Timoleontic  period  ( 345\u00ad338)  were  a  sym- machia  coinage  with  two  groups  of  hemilitra:  obv.  head  of Apollo  laureate,  legend: () or head of  Zeus Eleutherios;  rev.  lyre,  tripod,  galloping  bull  or  bunch  of grapes,  legend: (Consolo  Langher ( 1996c)  555\u00ad67;  cf.  also  Karlsson  ( 1995);  SNG  Cop.

Kallipolis  is  implicitly  called  a  polis  in  both  the  urban  and the  political  senses  by  Herodotos:  at  7.154.2  he  mentions Hippokrates'  aggression  against  a  number  of  communities, including  Kallipolis;  he  then  goes  on  to  state  that,  Syracuse excepted,  none  of  the  poleis  mentioned  escaped  being enslaved  by  Hippokrates  ( \u00b5    `;  cf.  Hansen  ( 2000)  205).  So  Kallipolis was  a  polis  which  Hippokrates  c. 495  turned  into  one  of  his dependencies  (Dunbabin  ( 1948)  380\u00ad82,  402;  Vallet  ( 1978) 119\u00ad20).  It  is  described  as  an  apoikia  by  Ps.-Skymnos  286  (cf. in  Strabo  6.2.6).  The  external  collective use  of  the city-ethnic  is  found  in  Hdt. 7.154.2. Only  two  events  are  known  from  the  history  of  Kallipolis: its  foundation  and  its  \"enslavement\"  by  Hippokrates (supra).  It  was  founded  by  Naxos  (no. 41;Strabo 6.2.6).  The date  of  the  foundation  is  unknown,  but  Ps.-Skymnos  286 mentions  it  alongside  Naxos'  other  foundations  (Leontinoi (no. 33),  Zankle  (no. 51)  and  Katane  (no. 30)),  and  this  may suggest  that  it  was  founded  contemporaneously  with  them (i.e.  C 8l;  M.  Miller  ( 1970)  35,  86).  In  Strabo's  day  it  was deserted  ( 6.2.6). Various  sites  have  been  brought  forward  as  candidates  for the  site  of  Kallipolis,  but  it  remains  unidentified (Camassa ( 1989b)),  though  recent  finds at San M arco  south  of  Naxos are  promising  in  this  connection  (Pelagatti  ( 1981)  295  n. 5). In  general,  the  fact  that,  like  Katane  and  Leontinoi,  it  was  a colony  of  Naxos  suggests  a  location  in  the  coastal  plain south  of  Naxos  or  on  the  slopes  of  Mt.  Etna;  in  any  case,  the foundation  of  Kallipolis  should  be  seen  as  a  part  of  the Chalkidian  occupation  of  north-eastern  Sicily.  The  siege mentioned  by Hdt. 7.154.2  implies  that  Kallipolis  was  forti- fied b y  C 5e. 28. ", "Kasmenai": "Identifier: 30. , (Kasmenaios) Map  47.  Lat. 37.05,long. 14.50.

Kasmenai  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Hdt. 7.155.2.Apart  from  the  entry  in  Steph.  Byz.,  the  city-ethnic  is attested  only  as  a  conjecture  in  Philistos  (FGrHist 556)  fr. 5 (Pais  ( 1894)  560\u00ad64;  recently  sustained  by  Di  Vita  ( 1987)), which,  if  accepted,  yields  an  attestation  of  the  external  col- lective  use  rC 6m. Kasmenai  was  founded  in  644/3  (Thuc. 6.5.3)  by  Syracuse (no. 47),  probably  as  a  colony,  although  there  is  no  mention of  an  oecist.  The  location  and  the  urban  layout  (infra)  point to  a  military  settlement  (Di  Vita  ( 1990)  350).  Kasmenai  was  a polis  according  to  Herodotos,  and  the  site  is  defined as t ype  A here,  but  the  polis  status  must  remain  uncertain,  though  Pais' conjecture  of  Philistos  (FGrHist 556)  fr. 5  (supra)  would  tend to support  polis  status  by  providing  an  instance  of  the  exter- nal  collective ethnic.  Hansen  ( 1997a)  36  classifies K asmenai as  a  dependent  polis  of  Syracuse,  i.e.  as  a  polis  founded  as  a fortress.  See  also  Akrai  (no. 10)  and  Heloron  (no. 18). If  the  conjecture  in  Philistos  (FGrHist 556)  fr. 5  (supra)  is correct,  Kasmenai  was  allied  with  the  Syracusans  against Kamarina  in  C 6m.  A  C 5e  bronze  plaque  (IGDS  no. 219) found  near  Monte  Casale  is  a  grant  ( []) of ateleia  etc.,  possibly  by  Kasmenai  (though  this  is  highly uncertain,  see  IGDS  no. 219  with  refs.).  The  text  refers  to \u00b5,  and  according  to  Hdt. 7.155.2  the  Syracusan gamoroi  expelled  by the  demos  in  a  civil  strife  in  491  took refuge  at  Kasmenai.  Cf.  Asheri  in  CAH v\u00b2.  768. Kasmenai  is  with  near  certainty  identified as the urban site  on  the  top  of  Monte  Casale  c. 12  km  west  of  Akrai (Marotta  D'Agata  and  Moreschini  ( 1992)).  The  settlement was  founded  on  a  high  plateau  (c. 70  ha),  bounded  by  steep slopes  and  with  no  direct  access  to  a  hinterland.  Apart  from the  natural  defences  the  plateau  was  protected  by  a  sturdy circuit  wall  3.4  km  long, 3m  wide,  built  in  megalithic  tech- nique  and  with  at  least  three  square  towers  along  the  north side.  Its  date  is  uncertain,  but  the  wall  is  often  considered  to be  contemporary  with  the  foundation,  or  a  little  later (Adamesteanu  ( 1986)  110).  A  double  curtain-wall,  a  diate- ichisma(?),  along  the  south-eastern  side  of  the  north-west plateau,  the  upper  terrace  and  so-called  acropolis,  may  date from  C 4f,  and  may  therefore  be  taken  as  a  later  reinforce- ment  due  to Carthaginian  pressure  (Martin  et al.( 1979)  531, fig. 73). The  settlement  was  laid  out  according  to  a  well-defined plan  already  in  C 7s.  The  urban  plan  consists  of  at  least  forty narrow  streets  oriented  north-north-west  to  south-south- east,  at  right  angles  to  the  long  axis  of  the  plateau  and  delim- iting  insulae  c. 25  m  wide:  an  early  stage  of  Western  Greek urban  planning  (Martin  et al.( 1979)  533).  The  rather  simple layout  may  reflect the function of  a  fort  or  garrison  defend- ing  the  territory  of  Syracuse.  Quite  apart  from  the  apparent lack  of  a  chora,  the  morphology  of  the  site  is  unsuitable  for  a colony  proper,  and  the  nature  of  the  votive material  from  the shrine  may  also  point  to  a  military  function  (Di  Vita  ( 1961); Marotta  D'Agata  and  Moreschini  ( 1992)  291).  However, against  this  it  should  be  noted  that  \"The  sheer  number  of inhabitants,  some  7\u00ad8,000  altogether,  shows  that  the  site must  have  been  a  proper  town,  and  that  some  2,000  soldiers max.  must  have  been  garrisoned  in  the  town  with  their  fam- ilies.  Also,  no  more  than  ca. 60%  of  the  town  has  been  exca- vated  and  the  absence  of  e.g.  an  agora  and  public  space  in general  carries  no  weight  as  the  evidence  stands\"  (Hansen ( 2000)  198\u00ad99).  An analysis  of  aerial  photographs  of  the plateau  of  Monte  Casale  also  shows  that  unexcavated  areas were  part  of  the  urban  layout  (Martin  et al.( 1979)  pl.  on  p. 528). The  only  public  architecture  known  at  Kasmenai  is  the temenos  with  temple  located  on  the  western  plateau  and sikelia  205 aligned  with  the  overall  urban  layout.  The  sanctuary  was squeezed  into  a  small  area  otherwise  given  over  to  habita- tion  (Voza  ( 1976\u00ad77)  561\u00ad62).  The  temple  has  two  phases:  an early  one  c. 560  and  a  later  one  525\u00ad500  (Ciurcina  ( 1977) 72\u00ad73),  but  the  temenos  has  a  C 7l  origin.  A  votive  deposit  of hundreds  of  javelins,  swords  and  arrowheads  indicates  a  cult of  a  martial  divinity  (supra). 30. ", "Apollonia": "Identifier: 14. , (Apolloniates) Map  47.

At 16.72.5,  Diodorus  reports  that  Apollonia,  which  with Engyon  (no. 14)  had  been  ruled  by  the  tyrant  Leptines,  had its  autonomia  restored  by  Timoleon  in  342/1;  in  his  brief report  of  the  incident,  Diodorus  refers  to Apollonia  as  a  polis in  the  political  sense  and  uses  the  collective  city-ethnic;  it  is called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Diod. 20.56.4  (r 307). According  to  Steph.  Byz. 106.4\u00ad5  (as  emended  by Cl\u00fcver), Apollonia  was  located  near  Kale  Akte  and  Alontion  (i.e.  on the  north  coast  of  Sicily),  and  urban  remains  on  the  plateau of  Monte  Vecchio,  Commune  of  S.  Fratello,  have  been  ident- ifed  with  Apollonia;  the  remains  testify  to  circuit  walls  and habitation  structures  built  in  isodomic  masonry  of  local marble  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea  ( 1975)  15;  Scibona  ( 1976a)).  However, Manni  ( 1981)  145  opts  for  modern  Pollina,  pointing  out  that according  to Diod. 16.72.5,  Apollonia  was  near  Engyon. According  to Diod. 20.56.4,  the  city  was  taken  by  Agathokles in 307  after  a  short  siege,  and  this  suggests  that  it  was  forti- fied b y  this  date. 14.

Adranon  was  founded  by Dionysios  I  c. 400,  and  in  his report  of  the  foundation  Diod. 14.37.5  refers  to it  as  a  polis (    ),  presumably  in  both  the  urban  and  the political  senses;  it  is  called  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Diod. 16.68.9  (r 345/4);  it  is  called  a  polis  mikra  in  the  urban  sense  at Plut.  Tim. 12.2  and  polichnion  at 12.3.The  chronological  rela- tionship  between  Adranon  and  the  neighbouring  indigen- ous  site  of  Mendolito  (contemporary  or  successive sites?)  is as  yet  unclarified (Albanese ( 1991)  esp. 548,  552\u00ad53).

Tim. 12.2. In 344/3,  Timoleon  received  Adranon  into  his  symmachia, and  the  city  presumably  provided  him  with  armed  forces (Diod. 16.69.3;Plut.  Tim. 12.6). There  are  Greek  finds from C 6l  at  Adranon,  but  the majority  of  the  finds from the habitation area and adjacent cemeteries  belong  to  the  Dionysian  foundation  and  date from  C 4\u00adC3;  the  finds suggest a local production of  red- figure pottery.  The  impressive  ashlar  isodomic  double  curtain-wall,  enclosing  an  area  of  about  60  ha,  probably dates  from  the  period  of  Dionysios'  foundation  (its  gates  are mentioned  at  Plut.

Adranos,  identi- fied b y  the  Greeks  with  Hephaistos  and  presumably  the patron  divinity  of  the  city  as  well  as  a  divinity  honoured throughout  Sicily,  had  a  temple  in  the  city  (Plut.

Diodorus  calls  his  native  city  a  polis  in  the  political  sense at 14.9.2  (r 404)  and  14.95.4  (r 392);  the  urban  sense  is  found in 14.95.5  (r 392);  politai  is  found  at  14.95.5\u00ad6.  The  internal collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on  C 5l  and  C 4  coins (infra),  and  Diodorus  uses  the  collective  city-ethnic  e.g.  at 14.65.5. At 14.95.4\u00ad7  (r 392),  Diodorus  describes  Agyrion  as  ruled by  the  (Hellenised?)  tyrant  Agyris,  allegedly  the  most  pow- erful  Sicilian  ruler  after  Dionysios  I;  the  city  is  described  as walled  (  ,  14.95.6),  as  having  an  acropolis ( 14.95.5)  and  c. 20,000  citizens  (      \u00b5,  14.95.4),  and  Agyris  as  wealthy  ( \u00b5 ,  14.95.5).  Agyris  concluded  a  symmachia  with Dionysios  I  and  campaigned  with  him  pandemei  ( 14.95.7). In  the  time  of  Timoleon,  Agyrion  was  ruled  by  the  tyrant Apolloniades,  who  was,  however,  deposed  by  Timoleon, whereupon  the  Agyrians  were  granted  Syracusan  citizen- ship  (Diod. 16.82.4;  cf.  Moggi  ( 1976)  357,  who  suggests  that the  population  was  transferred  to  Syracuse  (no. 47)). Timoleon  later  settled  10,000  new  colonists  in  Agyrian  sikelia  183 territory ( ), said  to  be  sizeable  (Diod. 16.82.5; the  territory  (chora)  is  mentioned  also  at  Diod. 14.95.2,from which  passage  it  appears  that  in  C 4e  it  extended  as  far  as  the river  Chrysas).  In  view  of  Diod. 16.83.3,  this  was  presumably a  regular  refoundation  of  Agyrion.  It  is  there  reported  that  the  prosperity  brought  about  by  Timoleon  (cf. R.  P.A.  Patan\u00e8  ( 1992)  77)  led  to  the  erection  of  a  splendid  the- atre,  temples,  a  bouleuterion,  an  agora,  a  circuit  wall  with towers,  and  monumental  tombs  (Diod. 16.83.3);  however,  as Lewis  ( 1994)  121  points  out,  Diodorus  puts  a  suspicious amount  of  emphasis  on  his  native  city.  But  the  appearance of  the  town  in  this  report  is  clearly  that  of  a  Greek  polis  (cf. Hansen  and  Fischer-Hansen  ( 1994)  85).  Actual  urban remains  are  scanty,  and  the  archaeological  evidence  for  cult sites  is  tenuous,  consisting  merely  of  a  few  architectural  ter- racottas  (Bejor  ( 1984a)  63).  The  size  and  location  of  the  the- atre  is,  somewhat  hypothetically,  reconstructed  on  the  basis of  mediaeval  documents  (R.  P.  A.  Patan\u00e8  ( 1992)  77\u00ad80).  The circuit  wall,  no  longer  extant  but  depicted  on  an  eighteenth- century  ad  drawing,  is  dated  to  C 4s  on  the  basis  of  this  evid- ence  (ibid. 80\u00ad82). A  bronze  coinage  of  Agyrion,  revealing  Akragantine influence,  is  known  from  possibly  as  early  as  C 5m  (cf.  Bejor ( 1984a)  62),  but  at  least  from  C 5l,  the  period  of  the  tyrant Agyris:  obv.  eagle  with  closed  wings  of  Akragantine  type; rev.wheel,legend: ,  , ,  (Head,  HN \u00b2124;  SNG Cop.

C 4s:  obv.  types:  Herakles  or  Apollo  or  male head  or  river-gods;  rev.  leopard  and  hare  or  man-headed bull,  legend: ;horse,or female figure sac- rificing or warrior,  with  legend  on  some  issues: , or (Head,  HN \u00b2125;R.

During  Timoleon's  rule Agyrion  issued  a  series  of  symmachia  coins:  obv.  head  of Zeus  or  Athena  or  river-god,  legend: rev. fulmen  and  eagle  or  club  or  free  horse,  legend: (Head,  HN \u00b2125;  Cutroni  Tusa  ( 1980\u00ad81) 491;  Karlsson  ( 1995)  157,  163). 8.Aitna  (Aitnaios) Map  47.Location  of  Aitna  I  as  Katane, but  Aitna  I  with  a  larger  territory  (Diod. 11.49.1),the  location and  territorial  size  of  Aitna  II  being  unknown.  Type:  A: (I), A?: \u00ad  (II).  The  toponym  is  ,  (Pind.  Pyth. 1.60;fr. 105a,  Maehler);  or  (Diod. 11.49.1;Strabo 6.2.3), though  for  example  Diod. 11.66.4  and 67.7  (r 466)  calls  it .The city-ethnic is (C5f  coins,  infra;  Pind. Nem. 9.30). Aitna  I Aitna  (I)  is  called  a  polis  by Pind.  Pyth 1.31  and 61, presumably  in  the  urban  as  well  as  the  political  sense  (cf. Hansen  ( 2000)  175\u00ad76;  cf.  Diod. 11.66.4  (r 466)). \u00b5  is found  in  Pind.  Pyth. 1.70.  The  internal  collective  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  found  on  coins  (infra);  the  external  collective use  is  found  in  Pind.  Nem. 9.30.  For  the  individual  use  of  the city-ethnic,  see  below  on  the  athletic  record  of  Hieron  and Chromios. In 476,  Hieron  transferred  the  populations  of  Katane  (no. 30)  and  Naxos  (no. 41)  to  Leontinoi  (no. 33),  renamed Katane  as  Aitna,  and  settled  his  new  foundation  with  10,000 oiketores: 5,000  from  the  Peloponnese  and  5,000  from Syracuse  (no. 47;Diod.  11.49.2;  cf.  Schaefer  ( 1961)  293); though  the  report  on  the  relocation  of  populations  refers  to both  Katane  and  Naxos,  Katane  (with  parts  of  adjacent  ter- ritories)  was  the  site  refounded  as  Aitna:   \u00b5  \u00b5\u00b5 ,      \u00b5           \u00b5  ,  \u00b5  .  (Cf. Strabo  6.2.3,  who  focuses  exclusively  on  Katane  in  his  report on  the  foundation  of  Aitna.)  Deinomenes,  Hieron's son, ruled  the  city  as  (Pind.  Pyth. 1.60\u00ad61).  Chromios was  installed  by  Hieron  as      and  so presumably  was  the  guardian  of  Deinomenes  while  he  was still  a  minor  (Schol.  Pind.  Nem. 9;  cf.  RE iii.  2454;Puech ( 1958)  19).  Pind.  Pyth. 1.62  says  that  Hieron  founded  the  city ` \u00b5    \u00b5,  presumably  indicating  that Aitna  was  intended  as  a  Dorian  city. After  Hieron's death  in  466,  his  brother  Thrasyboulos enlisted  the  help  of  the  Aitnaians  in  his  unsuccessful  attempt to  suppress  the  uprising  of  the  Syracusans  against  him (Diod. 11.67.7);  at  Aitna  the  rule  of  Deinomenes  survived long  enough  for  him  to erect  a  commemorative  monument for  Hieron  by Onatas  at  Olympia  (Paus. 6.12.1\u00ad2,  8.42.8\u00ad10), but  by 461  Hieron's  settlers  were  expelled  after  long  fighting (  \u00b5) with Syracuse as well as with the Sikels under  Douketios  (Diod. 11.76.3);  the  original  Katanaians returned  (Strabo  6.2.3)  and  a  new  geopolitical  arrangement followed  (Diod. 11.76.3:   ,i.e.the Sikels  and  the  Syracusans).  The  Aitnaians  retired  to  Inessa and  founded  a  new  Aitna  (Strabo  6.2.3),on  which  see  below, Aitna  II. With  Diod. 11.49.2,  scholars  see  Hieron's foundation  as  a \"plan  .  .  .  thoroughly  dominated  by concern  for  mercenar- ies\"  (Demand  ( 1990)  51),  and  Thrasyboulos  indeed  used Aitnaian  forces  in  his  power  struggle  at  Syracuse  (supra).  In addition,  Timaios  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 142a  schol.  Pind.  Nem. 1.1  and  Diod. 11.49.2  stress  another,  personal,  motive  of 184 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo Hieron's:  his  wish  to become  an  with  heroic  hon- ours  (cf.  Trumpf  ( 1958)  131  and  Harrell  ( 2002)  444\u00ad47). Hieron  did  in  fact  receive  heroic  honours  at  Aitna  (I)  in  his capacity  as  oecist  (Diod. 11.66.4);  according  to Strabo,  he was  buried  at  Aitna  (I),  but  his  tomb  was  destroyed  by  the Katanaians  on  their  return  ( 6.2.3). The  phase  of  Aitna  (I)  is  not  archaeologically  distinguish- able  from  that  of  Katane  (no. 30);  however,  the  construction of  the  theatre (TGR ii.  428\u00ad30,C5?)  may  perhaps  be  attrib- uted  to  Hieron  in  the  light  of  the  tradition  that  Aischylos composed  and  performed  The  Women  of  Aitna  in  honour  of the  newly  founded  city  (Aesch.  fr. 25,  Mette).  C 5  votives attest  to  a  sanctuary  of  Demeter,  highly  suggestive  given  the importance  of  this  cult  for  the  Deinomenids  (Dunbabin ( 1984)  64;White  ( 1964)).The  cult  of  Zeus  became  important at  Aitna  during  the  reign  of  Hieron  (cf.  Pind.  Pyth 1.29;  Ol. 6.96),  an  importance  reflected in the t ype  of  a  seated  Zeus (Aitnaios)  found  on  the  coins  of  the  new  foundation. Hieron  won  victories  at  Olympia  and  at  Delphi  (refs.  in Olympionikai 221)  and  was  proclaimed  a  citizen  of  Aitna ( ) according to schol.  Pind.  Nem. 1.1  Timaios (FGrHist 566)  fr. 142a,  a  custom  followed  by  Chromios  as well  (ibid.).  Chromios  was  victorious  at  the  Nemean  chariot race  (Pind.  Nem. 1,  date  uncertain)  and  in  the  same  event  at Sikyon  (no. 228;  Pind.  Nem. 9,in  476  or 474). Aitna  soon  struck  coins:  a  single  surviving  tetradrachm, probably  from  the  time  of  its  foundation  ( 476),  has  on  the obv.  quadriga  with  Athena  as  charioteer  and  a  Nike  above,  as at  Syracuse;  rev.  Zeus  enthroned,  holding  thunderbolt  and an  eagle-tipped  sceptre.  A  single  surviving  drachm  has  obv. horseman;  rev.  type  similar  to  the  tetradrachm.  The  rev.of both  denominations  carries  the  legend   (Boehringer  ( 1968)  76\u00ad79;Kraay ( 1976)  212).  A  magni- ficent t etradrachm  with  obv.  head  of  a  Silenos,  legend: ;  rev.  seated  Zeus,  was  issued  either  by  the Aitnaians  a  few  years  before  461  or  by  them  as  an  inaugura- tion  issue  when  they  refounded  Aitna  (II).  This  second  issue  also  has  litrai  with  rev.  thunderbolt,  legend: () (Boehringer (1968)  80\u00ad98;Kraay ( 1976) 212\u00ad13;  Manganaro  ( 1996b)  308). Aitna  II The  Aitnaians  were  expelled  from  Aitna  (I)  in  461, retired  to  Inessa,  a  Sikel  site  80  stades  inland  from  Katane  on Mt.  Etna,  and  refounded  their  community  there,  proclaim- ing  Hieron  oikistes  and  preserving  the  name  of  Aitna (Strabo  6.2.3;Diod.  11.76.3).  The  location  of  Aitna  II  is unknown,  although  various  attempts  have  been  made  to identify  the  site  (Bombaci  and  Massa  ( 1990)  290\u00ad93).  At its foundation  this  new  community  was  presumably  a  polis,as indicated  by  the  proclamation  of  an  oecist  (Strabo  6.2.3;  cf. also  infra  on  coins),  but  its  later  history  was  tumultuous:  in 451,  Douketios  took  the  city  and  in  this  connection  Diod. 11.91.1  mentions  a  person  whom  he  describes  as  \u00b5   (sc. ).  Syracusan  hippeis  in  con- flict w ith  Dionysios  I  took  Aitna  in  405  (Diod. 13.113.3),  and the  site  formed  the  base  of  opposition  to  Dionysios  ( 14.7.7, 8.1,  9.5);  Dionysios  sent  presbeis  urging  the  exiles  who  had gathered  with  the  hippeis  at  Aitna  to  return  to  Syracuse,  but the  majority  remained  at  Aitna  (Diod. 14.9.6\u00ad8).  In  403  the settlement  (termed  phrourion  in  this  connection)  was  taken by  Dionysios  (Diod. 14.14.2).  In  396  Dionysios  I  persuaded the  \"Campanians  living  at  Katane\"  to  relocate  to  Aitna,  and here  it  is  again  described  as  a  phrourion  (Diod. 14.58.2), which  is  not  incompatible  with  its  being  a  polis  (cf.  Thuc. 8.62.3;  Nielsen  ( 2002)),  but  Dionysios  obviously  treated  it  as a  dependency.  Close  connections  with  Syracuse  may  have been  facilitated  by  the  foundation  history  of  Aitna.  On  the other  hand,  Syracusan  control  over  the  area  of  Aitna  (II) may  have  a  history  going  back  beyond  the  original  founda- tion:  according  to  Diod. 11.26.7,  Gelon  planned  to  build  a temple  of  Demeter  at  Aitna,  but  because  of  his  death  it  was never  completed  (Diod. 11.26.7).  However,  the  date  (the reign  of  Gelon)  reveals  that  the  \"Aitna\"  in  question  must have  been  Inessa  (  the  later  Aitna  II)  and  not  Aitna  I founded  by Hieron  only  in  476,  and  so  the  passage  reveals that  Gelon  held  a  dominion  in  the  territory  of  Katane/Aitna II  (cf.  Freeman  ( 1891\u00ad94)  ii. 524\u00ad25). If  Aitna  can  be  presumed  to  have  remained  a  polis  during all  these  events,  its  identity  as  a  Hellenic  polis  may  be  uncer- tain  after  the  settlement  of  Campanians  at  the  site:  in  396 Himilkon  sent  ambassadors  to  \"the  Campanians  in  posses- sion  of  Aitna\",  urging  the  city  to  cut  its  ties  with  Dionysios (Diod. 14.61.4),  and  Diod. 16.67.4  (r 345)  again  refers  to  \"the Campanians  living  at  Aitna\";  however,  in  339  Timoleon \"destroyed  the  Campanians  at  Aitna,  having  forced  them  to surrender  by siege\"  (Diod. 16.82.4),  and  Aitna  appears  in  the C 3s  list  of  Delphic  theorodokoi  in  Sicily  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  25, col. iv  96;  Manganaro  ( 1964a)  420,  432),  presumably  as  a fully  Hellenic  community.

Byz. 62.5  has ;  the  city- ethnic  is  (IG xiv  215.3  (C 3)). The  only  (implicit)  reference  to Akrai  as  a  polis  is  in  the treaty  of 263  between  Rome  and  Syracuse  (Diod. 23.4.1), which  lists  the  poleis  assigned  to Hieron  II  and  uses  polis  in the  political  sense.  The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city- ethnic  is  found  in  IG xiv  215;  it  is  also  found  as  the  epithet  of Zeus  Akraios,  if  the  conjecture  by  Wilamowitz  is  accepted (IG xiv  203). Lack  of  the  name  of  an  oecist  and  of  a  mint  are  factors which  make  the  polis  status  of  Akrai  uncertain  and  tend  to suggest  a  military  settlement  protecting  the  territory  of Syracuse  (no. 47;  Di  Vita  ( 1956),  ( 1987))  rather  than  a  polis. There  are  very  few  sources  for  the  Archaic  and  Classical  peri- ods,  and  no  mention  of  the  city  from  between  the  period  of its  foundation  (Thuc. 6.5.2)  and  the  encampment  of  Dion  in its  vicinity  (Plut.  Dio 27  (r 357)).  All  in  all,  the  status  of  Akrai seems  uncertain.  Thucydides  uses  the  toponym  without qualification,  implying,  perhaps,  a  phrourion  controlling Syracusan  dominion,  though  it  may  possibly  have  been  a dependent  polis  founded  as  a  fortress  (as  has  been  suggested for  Kasmenai  (no. 29)  by  Hansen  ( 1997a)  36). Akrai  was  founded  by  Syracuse  (no. 47)  in  664  (Thuc. 6.5.2)  c. 36  km  west  of  Syracuse  itself,  as  the  outcome  of Syracuse's  policy  of  subjugating  a  large  part  of  south-east Sicily  (Di  Vita  ( 1987)).  There  is  evidence  for  small  nucleated settlements  and  farmsteads  in  the  hinterland  (Curcio  ( 1979) 87\u00ad88;  Marotta  D'Agata  et al.( 1994)  196),  but  the  size  of Akraian  territory  is  uncertain,  and  it  was  in  any  case  part  of the  Syracusan  dominion.  A  C 4  relief  of  Demeter  and  Apollo sikelia  189 from  Serra  Palazzo,  a  few  kilometres  from  Akrai,  may  indi- cate  a  suburban  sanctuary  (Orsi  ( 1920)). Akrai  occupied  a  plateau  west  of  modern  Palazzolo Acreide  between  the  upper  reaches  of  the  Tellaro  and  Anapo valleys.  The  city  was  defended  by  steep  slopes  and  a  circuit wall  raised  on  the  edge  of  the  plateau.  Only  short  stretches are  extant,  built  as  a  solid  ashlar  wall  dated  to  C 4f  (Bernab\u00f2 Brea  ( 1956)  21\u00ad25,fig.  9).  IG xiv  217  (Hell.)  mentions  a  pyla Selinountia  (Pugliese  Carratelli  in  Bernab\u00f2  Brea  ( 1956)  2; Manganaro  ( 1965)  204\u00ad5  supplies  an  alternative  reading). The  urban  site  occupied  the  central  part  of  the  plateau,  cov- ering  about  35  ha  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea  ( 1956)).  Evidence  for  the early  urban  history  of  Akrai  is  limited,  early  remains  being sparse.  The  most  conspicuous  remains  are  the  C 3  theatre (Mitens  ( 1988)  84\u00ad87)  and  the  C 2  bouleuterion  (Gneisz ( 1990)  302).However,there  are  traces  of  early  town  planning which  may  go  back  to  the  time  of  foundation  (Voza  and Lanza  ( 1994)).  The  east-west  plateia  spans  the  whole  city from  the  Syracusan  gate  in  the  area  of  the  probable  agora, the  theatre  and  bouleuterion  to  the  Selinountine  gate. The  C 6s  temple  of  Aphrodite  on  a  hill  above  the  city  has  a  history  going  back  to C 7m  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea  ( 1986);  for  the  attribution:  IG xiv  206,  208).  There  is  epigraphic  evid- ence  for  cults  of  Hera (IG xiv  208),  Zeus  Akraios  (IG xiv 203: [ ],  emended  to [ ]  by Wilamowitz),  Artemis  (IG xiv  217)  and  Kore  (IG xiv  217;  cf. Hinz  ( 1998)  119).  See  further  Pugliese  Carratelli  ( 1956)  and Bernab\u00f2  Brea  ( 1986)  13. The  cemeteries  of  Akrai  are  located  on  the  adjoining plateau  south  of  the  city,  Contrada  della  Pineta  (in  use C 7\u00adC5)  and  on  the  Colle  Orbo,  located  above  the  city  out- side  the  west  gate  (C 7  and  C 6;  Bernab\u00f2  Brea  ( 1956)  114\u00ad17). 11.

The  original  name  was Minoa  ( ,  (Hdt. 5.46.2), (Diod. 4.79.1));  the new,  or  additional,  name  Herakleia  ( `,  Polyb. 1.18.2)  is  commonly  assumed  to  have  originated  with  the seizure  of  the  city  by  the  remnants  of  the  expedition  of  the Spartan  Dorieus  (Hdt. 5.46.2;  RE viii.  437).  The  double name,  Herakleia  Minoa,  is  rare  (Polyb. 1.25.9: `  );  Herakleia  is  common  (Polyb. 1.18.2;Diod.  19.71.7); but  Minoa  appears  as  well  (Heracl.  Lemb. 59;Diod.  16.9.4; Plut.  Dio 25.11).  The  city-ethnic  is  `  (Diod. 20.56.3  and  possibly  IG xii.638  (C 4l),  on  which  see  infra). Hdt. 5.46.2  calls  it  an  of  Selinous  (no. 44);  the oecist(s)  and  the  date  of  foundation  are  unknown,  but  the date  must  be  post- 628  (date  of  Selinous'  foundation).  It  is called  a  polis  only  in  later  sources:  in  the  urban  sense  at  Plut. Dio 25.6  (r  time  of  Dion)  (cf. \u00b5  at  Plut.  Dio 25.5), and  in  the  political  sense  at  Diod. 16.9.4  (r 357).  A  description of  its  constitution  was  included  among  the  158  Aristotelian politeiai  (Heracl.  Lemb. 59;  Arist.  no. 55;  Gigon,  which  uses polis  in  a  mythological  account  of  the  foundation  by  Minos of  Crete).  The  external  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is found  in  Diod. 20.56.3  (r 307).  IG xii.638  (C 4l)  is  a  decree  by Samos  (no. 864)  granting  proxeny  etc.  to   \u00b5 `  and  a  reasonable  case  can  be  made that  the  honorandus  originated  from  the  present  Herakleia (Kebric  ( 1975),  ( 1977)  3\u00ad4;  Shipley  ( 1987)  164). There  are  very  few  sources  for  the  Archaic  and  Classical periods.  Nothing  is  known  of  the  political  and  institutional life  apart  from  the  notice  of  mythic  stamp  that  Minos imposed  Cretan  laws  on  the  city  (Heracl.  Lemb. 59;  cf. Perlman  ( 1992)). Shortly  before  500,  Minoa  was  captured  by  those Lakedaimonians  who,  under  the  leadership  of  Euryleon, had  survived  the  ill-fated  expedition  of  Dorieus  (Hdt. 5.46.2).  The  city  seems  to  have  been  defeated  by  Akragas  in C 6l  or  C 5e,  Lind.  Chron.  (FGrHist 532)  fr. 30  Xenagoras (FGrHist 240)  fr. 17  recording  a  dedication  at  Lindos  by Akragas  of  a  palladion  taken   . Though  the  date of  this  episode  is  uncertain,  it  is  most  often  seen  as  the  after- math  of  the  occupation  of  western  Sicily  by  Euryleon  and the  Spartans  (Luraghi  ( 1994)  41,  233\u00ad34).  During  Theron's reign  ( 488\u00ad473)  Herakleia  seems  to  have  been  a  city  within 196 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo the  dominion  of  Akragas  (no. 9),  possibly  after  its  conquest by  Theron  (cf.  Diod. 4.79.4  with  Fontana  ( 1978)).  After  the fall  of  the  Deinomenids,  the  city  seems  to  have  been involved  in  the  fighting between the disenfranchised merce- naries,  who  occupied  the  city,  and  the  Syracusans,  who  with the  Akragantines  eliminated  the  mercenaries  (see  FGrHist 577  fr. 1).  The  city  must  have  come  into  Carthaginian  hands by  the  treaty  of 383  between  Carthage  and  Dionysios  I (Diod. 15.17.5);  when  Dion  sought  refuge  in  Herakleia  in  357, the  city  was  still  under  Carthaginian  dominion  (Plut.  Dio 25.5;Diod.  16.9.4),  ruled  by  an  (Plut.)  or  an (Diod.),  but  it  is  described  as  in  Akragantine  ter- ritory  (Diod.).  By  the  treaty  of 339  it  reverted  to  the  Greek area  (Diod. 16.82.3)  and  was  refounded  by  Timoleon (Talbert  ( 1974)  159\u00ad60).  In  314  it  became  Carthaginian  once again  (Diod. 19.71.7). Herakleia  was  founded  by  Selinous  (Hdt. 5.46.2),  and  the colony  may  have  served  to  secure  the  eastern  border  of Selinous'  territory  which  was  threatened  by  Akragantine expansion  during  the  reign  of  Phalaris  (De  Miro  ( 1962) 144\u00ad46).  The  foundation  date  is  uncertain,  but  the  perspec- tive  of  a  powerful  Selinous  securing  its  eastern  border towards  Akragas  as  well  as  archaeological  evidence  (infra) suggest  a  C 6m  date.  However,  the  city  was  presumably  with- in  the  Akragantine  dominion  already  by  C 6l  and  at  least from  C 5e  (supra);  Akragas  was  located  only  25  km  to  the east. The  size  and  exploitation  of  the  chora  of  Herakleia  is  little known.  An  area  of  c. 6  km \u00b2  has  been  surveyed,  and  a  C 6 farmstead  or  workshop  found  c. 350  m  north  of  the  city (Wilson  and  Leonard  ( 1980)). The  city  was  founded  on  a  low  coastal  promontory (modern  Capo  Bianco)  on  the  estuary  of  the  river  Halykos (modern  Platani).  On  the  north  side  the  plateau  slopes gently  down  to  the  Halykos  valley,  on  the  south  side  ero- sion  has  produced  vertical  cliffs,  and  part  of  the  habitation area  of  the  Greek  city  may  have  been  destroyed.  A 6  km- long  stretch  of  the  circuit  wall  is  preserved  on  the  north- east  and  west  sides  facing  the  river  valley  and  the hinterland;  it  is  unknown  whether  the  cliff  facing  the  sea was  fortified.  The  C 5  wall  was  strengthened,  with  square towers  built  in  small  blocks  of  sandstone,  but  superseded byaC 4l  gypsum  ashlar  wall  with  an  upper  structure  of sun-dried  brick  (Tusa  and  De  Miro  ( 1983)  177\u00ad78;  De  Miro ( 1994)  480  dates  the  earliest  phase  of  the  circuit  wall  to  C 6). At  the  time  of  Timoleon's  refoundation  a  new  defensive wall  was  erected  within  the  earlier  city,  reducing  its  size  by a  half  (De  Miro  ( 1958a)). There  is  evidence  of  C 6s  occupation,  but  the  early  history of  the  site  has  not  been  fully  investigated,  and  the  size  of  the area  occupied  by  the  early  city  is  still  unknown.  (The  city  did occupy  the  area  of  the  later  Hellenistic  town,  but  probably also,  at  least  in  part,  the  western  plateau  within  the  first phase  circuit  wall--in all c. 60\u00ad70  ha).  The  Timoleontic refoundation  was  laid  out  as  an  orthogonally  planned  city, with  east\u00adwest-oriented  stenopoi,  north\u00adsouth-oriented plateiai,  and  the  single  insulae  c. 32  m  wide,  like  other Timoleontic  refoundations  (De  Miro  ( 1958b),  ( 1980) 716\u00ad21).The  urban  facilities  included  a  C 4l  theatre  (De  Miro ( 1955)). The  Archaic  cemetery  with  fairly  numerous  tombs  from the  period  550\u00ad500  is  located  just  outside  the  circuit  wall north-east  of  the  city.  The  cemetery  was  bisected  by  a  road, and  there  are  indications  of  social  differentiation  (De  Miro ( 1965)  10\u00ad11;  Wilson  ( 1996)  92). 21.  Herakleia  ( 2)  Map 47.Unlocated  site  in  western  Sicily, in  the  region  of  Eryx.  Type:  C: .  The  toponym  is `,  (Hdt. 5.43)  and  `,  (Diod. 4.23.3). A  city-ethnic  is  not  attested. Following  the  advice  of  Antichares  of  Eleon  and  the  affir- mation  of  the  Delphic  oracle  that  he  would  succeed,  Dorieus of  Sparta,  who  was  of  royal  and  so  Heraklid  descent,  set  out to  found  a  colony  in  the  region  of  Eryx  (Hdt. 5.43),  which, according  to  Antichares,  belonged  to  the  descendants  of Herakles  (Hdt. 5.43;  cf.  Paus. 3.16.5).  However,  Dorieus' expeditionary  force  was  severely  defeated  by  an  alliance  of Phoenicians  and  Egestans  (Hdt. 5.46.1;  cf.  Diod. 4.23.3  and Paus. 3.16.5).  In  the  aftermath  of  the  disaster  Euryleon,  the sole  survivor  of  the  synktistai,  and  the  remnants  of  the  expe- dition  captured  Herakleia  Minoa  (no. 20)  and  ousted  the tyrant  Peithagoras  of  Selinous  (Hdt. 4.46.2).  Referring  to the  death  of  Dorieus  as  a  thing  of  the  past,  Herodotos  dates the  defeat  of  the  expedition  prior  to c. 481/80  ( 7.158),  or  to 491/90  as  argued  by  some  scholars  (Merante  ( 1970a));  the beginning  of  the  expedition  is  connected  with  the  destruc- tion  of  Sybaris  (no. 70)  by  Kroton  (no. 56)  in  c. 510  (Hdt. 5.45; cf.  Merante  ( 1970a),  ( 1970b)  131\u00ad33,  who  argues  for  an  earli- er  chronology).  According  to  Diod. 4.23.3,  Dorieus  did  in fact  succeed  in  taking  back  the  land  of  the  Herakleidai, and  founded  a  polis  named  Herakleia  ( `) which prospered for a period before being razed  to  the  ground  by  the  Carthaginians.  Thus,  it  cannot  be ruled  out  that  a  Spartan  settlement  did  exist  for  a  period  and was  then  destroyed  by  the  Phoenicians  (cf.  B\u00e9rard  ( 1957) 260\u00ad66;  Stauffenberg  ( 1960)  esp. 189\u00ad98;  De  Vido  ( 1989) sikelia  197 with  further  refs.;  Asheri  ( 1988)  for  an  analysis  of  the  rela- tionship  between  Greeks,  Phoenicians  and  Elymians). 22.

The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is found  on  C 4s  coins  (infra);  the  external  collective use  is found  at  Diod. 14.7.6  (r 404)  and  14.78.7  (r 396).  The  latter passage  records  a  peace  treaty  between  Herbessos  and Dionysios  I. Herbessos  is  described  as  a  Sikel  community  at  Diod. 14.7.6  (r 404)  and  78.7  (r 396),but  is  included  here  on  account of  its  C 4s  Greek-style  coinage  (infra).  In  addition,  Greek  C 6e epigraphic  material  from  Montagna  di  Marzo,  the  pre- sumed  site  of  Herbessos,  includes  votives  to  Herakles  (cf. IGDS 166\u00ad68). The  location  of  the  city  is  unknown,  though  it  is  possibly to  be  located  at  Montagna  di  Marzo  (Bejor  ( 1989b)  280); Diod. 14.7.6  (r 404)  suggests  that  it  was  fortified b y  C 5l.  The urban  remains  from  this  site  are  of  C 6m  Sikel  walls  with  C 4 reinforcements  in  ashlar  masonry,  from  the  Greek  period. There  are  some  traces  of  urban  planning,  but  whether  these are  Douketian  or  Timoleontic  is  uncertain.  However,  the majority  of  the  urban  remains,  as  well  as  the  cemeteries,  are Hellenistic  (Cutroni  Tusa  and  Moreschini  ( 1992)).

The  legends  are  unusual  and  difficult t o  interpret;  the  follow- ing  variants  are  found:  (a)  obv.  ,  rev. ;  (b)  obv. ,  rev. ;  (c) .  While  (c) can  be  interpreted  as  an  ordinary  legend  of  a  civic  coinage  of Kephaloidion,  (a)  and  (b)  seem  to  involve  a  foreign  group,  the Herakleiotai,  of  unknown origin.  Ek  Kephaloidiou  of  (a) probably  means  \"based  on  Kephaloidion\"  (Kraay  ( 1979)  29) and  suggests  that  the  Herakleiotai  had  been  admitted  to Kephaloidion  as  a  group;  the  double  legend  of  (b),  naming both  the  Kephaloidians  and  the  Herakleiotans,  suggests  that the  latter  had  been  admitted  to  citizenship  by  a  block  grant but  kept  their  individual  identity;  this  would  suggest  that Kephaloidion  was  a  polis  at  the  time  of  the  minting  of  these coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2  118;  Consolo  Langher  ( 1961);  Cutroni  Tusa and  Tullio  ( 1987)  210\u00ad11).  (Bernab\u00f2  Brea  ( 1975)  24\u00ad29  assigns the  issues  to a  period  of  autonomy,  independent  from Carthaginian  rule,  after  the  treaty  with  Himilkon  (infra);  cf. also  Jenkins  ( 1975)  92\u00ad99  for  a  downdating  of  some  of  the issues  to  the  period  of  Timoleon.) Kephaloidion  was  originally  a  settlement  located  on  the confines of  Himeraian  and  Sikel  territories.  In  396,Himilkon of  Carthage  concluded  a  treaty  of  friendship  with  Himera and  \"those  settled  at  the  phrourion  of  Kephaloidion\"  (     :Diod.  14.56.2). Whether  these  latter  were  Greeks  is  not  clear,  but  they  were presumably  not  Himeraians.  At  Diod. 14.78.7  (r 396) Kephaloidion  is  implicitly  described  as  Sikel,  but  the  Greek-style  coinage  discussed  above  suggests  Hellenisation; it  was  captured     by  Dionysios  I  in  396 (Diod. 14.78.7)  and  is  not  met  with  again  before  the  time  of  Agathokles  (Diod. 20.56.3  (r 307),  77.3  (r 306)).  The  archae- ological  evidence  at  the  site  is  mainly  Hellenistic,  but  the 208 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo massive  circuit  wall  in  polygonal  technique  may  go  back  to C 4;  the  layout  of  the  mediaeval  city  may  in  its  main  lines coincide  with  that  of  the  ancient  city  (Cutroni  Tusa  and Tullio  ( 1987)  211\u00ad14). 33.

Ps.-Skylax 95  mentions  the  island  and  its  harbour,        \u00b5,  while Strabo  13.1.46  mentions  two  harbours.  There  was  a  single polis  on  the  island  of  Tenedos  (Hdt. 1.151.2),  which  also  had territory  on  the  peraia  (Strabo  13.1.32);  Xen.  Hell. 5.1.7  uses about  the  island.  Strabo  13.1.44  shows  that  Tenedian territory  included  Achaiion,  while  13.1.46  indicates  that  it began  at  Sigeion  and  Achilleion,  and  included  Achaiion. Strabo  13.1.47,  a  corrupt  passage,  is  usually  restored  to  show that  Larisa  and  Kolonai  were  previously  parts  of  the Tenedian  peraia  (            , &lt;  &gt;  ).  However,  Cook  ( 1973)  197\u00ad98  proposes  restor- ing            , &lt;  &gt;    at this  point,  and  this  also  makes  good  sense.  Arist.  Rh. 1375b31 with  Anon.  in  Arist.  Artem  Rhet. 81.12  indicates  that  Tenedos claimed  control  over  Sigeion  some  time  in  C 4. Tenedos  was  an  Aiolic  settlement  founded  from  Lesbos (Hdt. 1.151.1\u00ad2;Strabo 13.1.46).Tenedos  was  a  member  of  the Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district  and is  recorded  from  452/1  (IG i\u00b3  261.i.6)  to  429/8  (IG i\u00b3 282.iii.30)  a  total  of  fifteen times,  twice  completely  restored, usually  paying  a  phoros  of 2  tal., 5,280  dr.

Contributions    are  recorded  in  447/6  (IG i\u00b3 265.ii.108\u00ad9).  Thuc. 7.57.5  describes  the  Tenedians  as .  The  Athenian  general  Paches  placed  a  group  of pro-Spartan  Mytilenians  in  temporary  custody  on  Tenedos in 427  (Thuc. 3.28.2;  cf. 35.1);  Tenedos  had  been  at  odds  with Lesbos  during  the  Revolt  of 428/7  and  had  not  joined  them (Thuc. 3.2.3).  Tenedos  was  also  a  member  of  the  Second Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.A.ii.79).  A  Tenedian  prox- enos  of  the  Boiotians  is  mentioned  in  IG vii  2418  ( 355\u00ad346). There  was  an  Aristotelian  Constitution  of  the  Tenedians (Arist.  frr. 610\u00ad11);  a  fragment  in  Steph.  Byz. 616.3ff  refers  to a  law  concerning  adulterers  established  by  a  king  who  was obliged  to  punish  his  own  son  with  death  by  beheading according  to  its  harsh  terms.  In  fact,  this  is  an  aetiological story  to  explain  the  coin  types  of  Tenedos  with  the  double axe  motif  and  has  little  historical  value.  C. 330  an  Argive  the- orodokos  resided  at  Tenedos  (SEG 23  189.ii.19). The  site  includes  evidence  of  grid  planning  of  the  ancient city,  cemeteries  dating  from  C 8  to C 4,  and  the  remains  of  a theatre  of  uncertain  date  at  Yeni  Kale  Tepe  (Mitchell  ( 1999) 142).

At  Thuc. 4.52.3  Antandros  is  called  a polis  twice,  first in the urban,  then  in  the  political  sense;  and it  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Thuc. 8.108.4.Xen. Hell. 1.1.26  has  politeia.  It  is  called  by Diod. 13.42.4 (r 411).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  exter- nally  by  Thuc. 8.108.4,Xen.Hell.  1.1.26  and  an  inscription  of C 2  (Michel  542),  and  internally  by  C 5s  coins  (infra).  The external  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  in  SEG 22 191  (C 4s). Its  territory  was  called  by  Arist.  Hist.  an. 519a16  and  later  sources.  It included  shipyards  at  Aspaneus and  a  sanctuary  of  Artemis  at  Astyra,  which  is  called  a  polis in  Ps.-Skylax  98,a kome  in  Strabo  13.1.51,  and  a  polichne  in Strabo  13.1.65.  It  belonged  to  the  Troad  (Hdt. 5.26),  and  its tribal  affiliation was A iolic. Antandros  was  founded  by  Aiolians  (Thuc. 8.108.4), although  later  sources  alleged  a  link  with  Andros,  on  a  spu- rious  etymological  basis  (Pomponius  Mela  1.18;  Servius  on Verg.  Aen. 3.6).  There  are  also  references  to the  indigenous population.  Hdt. 7.42.1  calls  it  ; Alkaios  (D.  L.  Page,  Lyrica  Graeca  Selecta  fr. 156  apud  Strabo 13.1.51)  refers  to  a  community  of  Leleges;  and  Demetrios  of Skepsis  apud  Strabo  13.1.51  to  a  community  of  Kilikes.  It  is also  said  to  have  been  previously  occupied  by  Thrakian Edonoi  and  Kimmerioi  (Arist.  fr. 483.1). The  city  was  captured  by  Otanes,  the  Persian  satrap  of  the Hellespontine  area,  c. 512  (Hdt. 5.26).  It  became  a  member  of the  Delian  League  after  the  Mytilene  Revolt  from  427,but was  betrayed  to  Mytilenian  refugees,  who  occupied  the  city before  it  was  recovered  in  summer  425  (Thuc. 4.52.3,  75.1\u00ad2). The  toponym  is  recorded  among  the  Aktaiai  poleis  in  the tribute  lists  of 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.125,  restored)  and  421  (IG i\u00b3 77.iv.15),  and  Antandros  was  reckoned  to be  one  of  the    (Thuc. 4.52.3).  In  411/10  it  ejected  a  Persian garrison  (Thuc. 8.108.4\u00ad5).  There  is  evidence  for  sympoliteia with  the  Syracusans,  who  were  given  politeia  by  the Antandrians  in  thanks  for  benefits r eceived  in  409  (Xen. Hell. 1.1.26).  It was  on  the  route  of  the  Delphic  theorodokoi around  200  (Plassart  ( 1921)  8;  Cook  ( 1988)  12).  In  C 2 Antandros  sent  foreign  judges  to  Peltai  in  Phrygia  (Michel 668). The  acropolis  is  mentioned  by  Thuc. 8.108.5,and  the  walls were  repaired  with  Syracusan  help  in  409  (Xen.  Hell. 1.1.26). Cults  of  Antandros  include  Apollo,  who  appears  as  a  con- tributor  in  a  list  of  stephanephoroi  of  C 1  (Michel  668),  and Artemis  Astyrene,  who  appears  on  the  coinage.

Hell. 3.1.21  (       ).  Xen.  Hell. 3.1.21  also  refers to  its  inhabitants  as  citizens  in  emphatic  terms:       ,   \u00b5         ,  . This  passage,  however,  also  implies  that  the  population  was mixed.  Xen.  Hell. 3.1.28  also  employs  the  term  patris  in  rela- tion  to  the  city.  The  collective  city-ethnic  is  used  internally on  coins  (infra)  and  externally  on  the  Athenian  tribute  lists (infra);  the  external  individual  use  is  attested  in  a  C 3  epitaph from  Athens  (Agora xvii  666). The  name  of  the  territory  was  (Strabo  13.1.33), and  the  city  lay     \u00b5   (Strabo 14.1.6).  Its  extent  must  have  been  large,  but  the  topography remains  extremely  obscure.  According  to  Strabo  13.1.45,it included  a  walled  settlement  called  (possibly  itself a  small  polis),  and  it  was  separated  from  the  territory  of Kebren  by  the  river  Skamandros  (Strabo  13.1.33).  The  site  of Palaiskepsis  was  said  to  be  above  Kebren  in  the  highest  parts of  Mt.  Ida  near  Polichna  (sic)  (Strabo  13.1.52).  Strabo  13.1.51 describes  the  early  but  undated  metoikesis  from  Palaiskepsis to  Skepsis  as  follows:     \u00b5    \u00b5         .  The  figure of 60  stades  was  emended  to  260  by  Leaf  ( 1923)  270\u00ad71,who was  guided  by  Strabo's  indications  that  Skepsis  lay  in  the river  basin  of  the  Skamandros,  while  Palaiskepsis  was  in  that  of  the  Aisepos.  Following  this,  Strabo  13.1.52  refers  to the arrival  of  Milesian  settlers  to  be  joined  in  a  sympoliteia  at Skepsis,  perhaps  after  the  sack  of  Miletos  in  494,    .C5  coins  have  the city-ethnic  () () which may refer to the  refoundation  of  Skepsis  at  this  time.  After  310  Skepsis was  synoecised  with  Alexandreia  by  Antigonos,  but  restored to  independence  by  Lysimachos  (Strabo  13.1.52). Skepsis  was  originally  an  Aiolic  city  (implied  by  use  of form  on  C 5  coins,  infra);  but  there  was  a  sec- ondary  foundation  by  Milesians  after  494  (Leaf  ( 1923) 272\u00ad73).  The  original  oecists,  according  to  Strabo  13.1.52\u00ad53, following  Demetrios  of  Skepsis,  were  Skamandrios  and Askanios. Skepsis  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to the  Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  in  453/2  (IG i\u00b3 260.viii.4,  partly  restored),  in  452/1  (IG i\u00b3  261.iv.27)  and  in 441/0  (IG i\u00b3  271.ii.31),  paying  a  phoros  of 1  tal.  It  was  assessed for  tribute  possibly  in  454/3  (Krateros  fr. 24,  Krech)  and  in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.65,completely  restored),  probably  in  410/9 (IG i\u00b3  100.iii.4,  partly  restored). Strabo  13.1.52  records  a  progression  in  its  constitution from  kingship  (descendants  of  Skamandrios  and  Askanios), through  oligarchy,  to  democracy  (after  the  sympoliteia  of Milesian  settlers).  Imhoof-Bl\u00fcmer  ( 1901)  45  suggests  that  a coin  with  the  legend  is  evidence  for  a dynast  of  that  name  in  C 2  or  C 1;  but  this  may  simply  be  an allusion  to  the  legend  of  the  Antenoridai,  current  at  the  city (Leaf  ( 1923)  275\u00ad80).  The  magistrates  included  a   (Strabo  13.1.52).  The  city  received  a  letter  from  Antigonos  in 311  (OGIS 5),and  the  demos  responded  by  passing  a  decree  in the  king's  honour.  The  Skepsians  resolved  to  set  up  a  sanctu- ary  and  altar  for  Antigonos  and  to  found  an  annual  festival, which  would  feature  a  thysia,an  agon,a stephanephoria  and a  panegyris.  Among  the  city  magistrates  the  text  mentions  a tamias,  who  was  responsible  for  expenditure  on  the  festival, and  a  grammateus,  who  was  to  supervise  the  erection  of  the stele  inscribed  with  the  decree  in  the  sanctuary  of  Athena (OGIS 6).  An  early  Hellenistic  citizenship  decree  testifies  to  the  organisation  of  the  citizens  into  phylai  (Judeich ( 1898a)).  Xen.  Hell. 3.1.15  implies  that  Skepsis  was  a  fortified site. Derkylidas  conducted  a  sacrifice t o  Athena  on  the  acrop- olis  in  399  (Xen.  Hell. 3.1.21;  cf.  OGIS 6.40\u00ad41),  perhaps  sug- gesting  a  cult  of  Athena  Polias.  There  was  also  a  communal cult  of  Dionysos  (coins,  inscription  of  C 4/C3;  SEG 26  1337 (regulations  for  priesthood  of  Dionysos  Bambouleios, probably  dating  to C 2)).  The  city  used  the  Ionic  calendar, and  the  month  Lenaion  is  attested  (SEG 26  1337).

Hell. 3.1.16  and in  an  early  Hellenistic  inscription  (I.Ilion 25;  cf.  also  Hellan. fr. 25b).  Its  name  has  been  restored  ( '[]) at IG  i\u00b3 71.iii.132  in  a  list  of  Aktaiai  poleis  which  uses  polis  in  the political  sense.  Strabo  13.1.27,  referring  to the  period  before 189,  calls  it  a  \u00b5.  The  collective use  of  the  ethnic  is attested  internally  by a  decree  of  Ilion  of 359  (Tod 148  I.Ilion 23)  and  by  C 4l  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2  546),  and externally  by Xen.  Hell. 3.1.16.  The  external  individual  use  of the  ethnic  is  found  in  IG ii\u00b2  505.8  ( 302/1). Strabo  refers  to  a  period  when  Ilion  was  a  kome:        \u00b5 \u00b5  ,            \u00b5   (Strabo  13.1.16).  The  name  of  the  territory  was  '  (Hdt. 7.42), '  (Hdt. 5.94.2),or  simply  ' (Hdt. 5.122.2). Ilion  was  one  of  the  Aiolic  settlements  of  the  Troas  (Xen. Hell. 3.1.16).  If  the  toponym  is  correctly  restored  in  IG i\u00b3  71 and 77,  it  was  one  of  the     in  the  Delian League  and  was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.124, 132, [],2  tal.)  and  in  422/1  (IG i\u00b3  77.iv.14  21,amount  not preserved,  toponym  completely  restored).  Ilion  awarded proxenia  to  Menelaos,  son  of  Arrhibaios  of  Athens,  in  C 4 (Tod 148  I.Ilion 23).A  kind  of  sympoliteia  with  Lampsakos (no. 748)  is  probably  attested  by  an  unique  silver  tridrachm: obv.  head  of  Athena  with  Corinthian  helmet,  r.;  rev.  winged horse,  r.,  under  the  horse: (),  above  it: () (Frisch (1975) XV,  ( 1978)  129\u00ad30  (c. 300)). In  the  early  Hellenistic  period  it  was  democratic,  as  is shown  by  a  lengthy  law  which  was  devised  against  tyrants and  oligarchies  (Michel  524  I.Ilion 25).  This  text  also implies  that  the  chief  magistrate  was  a  strategos,  an  office that  could  only  be  held  once;  there  was  also  a  tamias,  and  the magistracies  were collectively  known as  archai.A  citizenship decree  of  c. 300  testifies t o  the  organisation  of  the  citizens into  phylai  (I.Ilion 24.13).  The  city  buildings  included  a  pry- taneion  (I.Ilion 24.20,  25.25)  and  a  dikasterion  (I.Ilion 25.78, perhaps  a  lawcourt  rather  than  a  court  room). Aen.  Tact. 24.4\u00ad13  refers  repeatedly  to  ,thus indicat- ing  that  the  city  was  fortified in C 4f  (cf.  Xen.  Hell. 3.1.16), but  there  are  virtually  no  monumental  traces  of  the  pre-Hellenistic  city,  although  the  remains  suggest  that  the settlement  was  more  prosperous  in  C 7\u00adC6  than  in  C 5\u00adC4 (PECS).  Recent  excavations  show  almost  continuous  occu- pation  of  the  site  after  the  fall  of  Troy  VII. 2  in  the  late  Bronze Age.  Archaic  finds include bronze fibulae  of  c. 700  and  an Aiolic  capital  (Mitchell  ( 1999)  138).  Recent  excavations  have revealed  a  sanctuary  of  C 8\u00adC6,  but  no  further  building  in the  Classical  period  (Rose  ( 2000)  284).  The  city  wall,  attrib- uted  by  Strabo  13.1.26  to  Lysimachos,  in  fact  appears  to  have been  built  c. 275\u00ad250  (Rose  ( 1997)  93\u00ad101).Ilion  was  refound- ed  at  the  end  of  C 4,  probably  by  Lysimachos  (Strabo  13.1.26, troas  1009 the  interpretation  of  this  passage  is  very  controversial;  see Leaf  ( 1923)  142\u00ad43,  who  attributes  the  embellishment  to Alexandreia;  but  see  L.

HN 5.125  calls  Arisbe  an  oppidum,  which  was still  inhabited  in  his  day.  By  216  it  was  part  of  the  territory of Abydos  (Polyb. 5.111.5).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic is  attested  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3 281.iii.38). The  founder  of  Arisbe  was  Miletos  (Strabo  14.1.6).  Steph. Byz. 119.9  reports  a  foundation  story  from  Ephor.  fr. 164  that Arisbe  was  a  Mytilenian  foundation,  but  this  seems  to  be  a false  inference  from  the  existence  of  the  homonymous Arisba  on  Lesbos  (Strabo  13.1.21;  Hdt. 1.151.2).  It  is  not  men- tioned  by Herodotos,  Thucydides  or  Xenophon,  although their  narratives  concern  the  cities  of  this  region  (see  Tenger ( 1994)  147).

However,  the  col- lective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  by  C 4  coins (infra)  and  externally  by  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (infra). The  city  presumably  controlled  a  small  territory  in  the Skamandros  basin  between  Ilion  and  Skamandra. Gentinos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.

Hell. 3.1.15,21  describes  it  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense; at 3.1.22  the  political  sense  is  probably  a  connotation.  The collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  by  Xen. Hell. 3.1.22  and  internally  by  C 4  coins  (infra).  The  individual use  of  the  ethnic  is  recorded  c. 270  on  an  inscription  of  the Aitolians  (IG ix.1\u00b2  13.27). The  name  of  the  territory  was   ,  (sc. ;  Welles  ( 1934)  no. 10  ( 275):     \u00b5     ).  It  was  the  inland  region  to the  east  of  the  route  followed  by  Xerxes  to  Abydos  in  481 (Hdt. 7.43.2),  and  included  Marpessos,  home  of  the  sibyl Herophile,  whose  image  is  shown  on  coins  of  Gergis  (Paus. 10.12.4;Head,  HN \u00b2  543).  The  Gergithes,  described  by  Hdt. 5.122.2  as         ,were an  indigenous  non-Greek  people  occupying  the  interior  of the  Troad  north  of  the  river  Skamandros;  see  Leaf  ( 1923) 102\u00ad6.  This  passage  and  Hdt. 7.43.2  indicate  that  Gergis  was effectively  a  barbarian  polis,  in  contrast  to  its  neighbours  on the  coast  of  the  Troad.  The  polis  was  controlled  by  the  pro- Persian  \"satrap\"  Zenis  of  Dardanos  (or  \"the  Dardanian\") and  then  by his  widow,  Mania,  in  399,  and  eventually  by  her son-in-law,  Meidias  of  Skepsis  (Xen.  Hell. 3.1.15\u00ad22;see Winter  ( 1994)). Some  of  its  inhabitants  were  transplanted  by  metoecism to  a  new  settlement  called  Gergitha  near  the  springs  of  the river  Kaikos  by  Attalos  I  (Strabo  13.1.70).  After  188  its  territ- ory  was  attached  by  synoecism  to  Ilion  (Livy  38.39).

Strabo  observes  that  Kebrenia  was  parallel  to  and  south  of ancient  Dardania,  and  that  it  was  divided  from  the  territory of  Skepsis  by  the  river  Skamandros.  It  was  regarded  by Ephor.  fr. 22,as   .Steph.Byz.  371.3  calls a   . The  city  was  founded  from  Kyme  in  Aiolis  (Ephor.  fr. 10; Homeri vita  Herodotea  c. 20,  Allen).  Xen.

It  belonged to  the  Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.26)  to  447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.ii.9)  a  total  of  five times, twice  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 3  tal.  in  454/3  (IG i\u00b3 259.iv.26)  and  8,700  dr.  in  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.ii.33).  It  was assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.99). In 310  it  was  incorporated  into  the  new  city  of  Antigoneia, later  Alexandreia.  In  late  C 3  a  decree  probably  of  the Kebrenians  was  set  up  in  Assos  in  honour  of  a  troop  of  sol- diers  and  their  commander  for  coming  to  their  assistance (I.Assos 4;  cf.  L.  Robert  ( 1951)  33). Kebren  had  imposing  fortifications sited in  \u00b5    (Xen.  Hell. 3.1.17),  with  walls  (ibid. 18)  and gates  (ibid. 19).  The  existing  walls  are  dated  to  C 5l  or  earlier (Cook  ( 1973)  330).  They  measure  5  km  in  circumference  and enclose  an  area  of  c. 90  ha;  they  were  reported  to  survive  over 10  feet  high  and  are  8\u00ad10  feet  thick  (Leaf  ( 1923)  171\u00ad73,  citing Calvert;  Judeich  ( 1898b)  539;  Cook  ( 1973)  328\u00ad31).  On  the citadel  are  a  few  remains  of  a  separate  acropolis  wall  (Cook ( 1973)  334).  Numerous  ancient  building  remains  have  been noted  on  the  site.

L.  Robert  ( 1951)  17\u00ad36  argued  that  Kebren  was  refounded under  the  name  Antiocheia  in  the  early  Hellenistic  period and  underwent  synoecism  with  Birytis  between  280  and 270.

Schwertheim  ( 1988) (SEG 38  1251)  published  an  inscribed  fragment  purporting to  be  part  of  a  treaty  between  Athens  and  Hamaxitos.  Lewis ( 1993)  (SEG 43  877)  suggested  that  this  was  part  of  an Athenian  imperial  decree,  and  questioned  the  restoration which  assigned  the  text  to  Hamaxitos.

It  belonged  to  the  region  of  the  Troad  and  was  called     by Thuc. 1.131.1  (but  this  may  be  a reference  to the  homonymous  place  in  the  territory of Lampsakos).  The  territory  was  formerly  part  of  the Tenedian  Peraia  (Strabo  13.1.47). The  settlement  was  founded  by  Aiolians  (Strabo  13.1.62) and  was  reputed  to  be  the  home  of  the  Thrakian  king Kyknos,  killed  by  Achilles,  in  a  story  told  in  post-Homeric epic  (Leaf  ( 1923)  219).

The  Spartan  regent  Pausanias  took  refuge  here  and  made contact  with  the  Persian  king  after  leaving  Byzantion  in  478 (Thuc. 1.131.1,  unless  this  passage  refers  to  the  Kolonai  in  the interior  of  the  territory of  Lampsakos).

The  earliest  collective  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  in the  Athenian  tribute  lists  between  454/3  and 429/8  (infra) and  the  earliest  collective  internal  use  is  on  C 5f  coins  (infra).

Hdt. 7.95.2)  or  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.35). It  included  gold  mines  mentioned  by  Kallisthenes  ((FGrHist 124)  fr. 54.12);  Xen.  Hell. 4.8.37  implies  that  these  were  in  the plain  near  Kremaste.  Xerxes  mustered  his  troops  along              (Hdt. 7.45).The  territory  extended  to  Dardanos  on  the  south-west (Hdt. 7.43.2)  and  as  far  as  Astyra,  which  by  Strabo's  day  was incorporated  (Strabo  13.1.23).  Abydos  was  a  member  of  the Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district  and is  registered  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.ii.29,  restored)  to 418/17 (IG i\u00b3  287.ii.25)  a  total  of  eighteen  times,  twice  completely restored,  paying  a  phoros  of  sometimes  4  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  271.ii.29), sometimes 6  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.17)  and  sometimes  other amounts.  It  was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.62, restored).  It  defected  from  the  Delian  League  in  411  (Thuc. 8.62.1),  and  Xenophon  mentions  the  presence  of  a  Spartan harmost  at  Abydos  in  Hell. 3.1.9,  4.8.3,  5  and 32.In Hell. 2.1.8 he  refers  to foot-soldiers  of  Abydos,  and  in  4.8.33  to 200 hoplites, 50  of  whom  were  later  killed  ( 4.8.39). Abydos  was  under  the  control  of  a  pro-Persian  tyrant, Daphnis,  in  the  520s  (Hdt. 4.138.1),  and  it  was  one  of  the Hellespontine  cities  destroyed  by  fire b y  Dareios  after  his Skythian  expedition  (Strabo  13.1.22).Five men  of  Abydos  are recorded as proxenoi  of  Athens  in  IG ii\u00b2  49  (C 4e);  and Iphiades  of  Abydos  was  appointed  proxenos  by Knidos  in C 4f(I.Knidos  603). Arist.  Pol. 1305b33  classes  the  constitution  of  Abydos  as  an oligarchy,  in  which  the  magistrates  were  still  chosen  by  the hoplites  and  the  people.  As  such  it  was  unstable  and  liable  to upheaval: '  \u00b5       \u00b5\u00b5 \u00b5 ,          \u00b5,          ...  '          \u00b5.  This  oligarchy  may  be  dated  to  the  peri- od  after  Abydos'  defection  from  Athens  in  411.  C. 360,  after  a period  of  stasis,  the  oligarchy  was  replaced  by  a  new  tyranny under  Iphiades  (Arist.  Pol. 1306a26\u00ad31;  I.Knidos 603).  The same  stasis,  or  another  period  of  stasis,  is  referred  to at  Arist. Oec. 1349a3\u00ad8:a stasiasmos  led  to  the  land  being  left  unculti- vated,  and  to resident  foreigners  ( \u00b5) refusing to make  loans  until  they  had  been  paid  for  existing  debts.  A decree  was  passed  ( ) allowing anyone who wished  to  provide  loans  to  the  farmers,  who  were  to  repay their  creditors  from  the  first y ield  of  their  harvests. There  are  few  remains  of  the  city.  Arist.  Mir.  ausc. 832b17 mentions  a  theatre,  and  the  accounts  of  sieges  in  C 5l  and  C 4 imply  that  it  was  fortified ( Thuc. 8.62.3;Xen.

Referring  to  an  uncertain  period  between  C 4  and  C 1, Strabo  described  Dardanos  as  an  ancient  foundation,  whose inhabitants  were  often  transferred  to  Abydos  by  Hellenistic kings,  but  then  returned  to  the  ancient  foundation, \u00b5 ,   ' ,       \u00b5 \u00b5     ,        \u00b5  (Strabo  13.1.28). This  passage  may  imply  that  it  was  an  early,  perhaps  C 7 Greek  colonial  settlement,  but  the  colonists  are  unknown. Dardanos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  from 451/50  (IG i\u00b3  262.iv.10)  to  429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282B.i.3)  a  total  of  fif- teen  times,  twice  completely  restored,  paying  mostly  a phoros  of 1  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  270.ii.3).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.72,  restored).  It  may  have  been  controlled by  the  satrap  of  Aiolis,  ,in  399  (Xen.  Hell. 3.1.10).

IG ii\u00b2  78  (before 378)  is  possibly  a  honorary  decree  for  citizens  of  Dardanos (l. 8: [~]). Dardanos  struck  coins  of  electrum,  silver  and  bronze from  C 6/C5  to C 4.  Almost  all  the  coin  types  show  fighting cocks.  ( 1)  (?)Electrum  stater,  minted  in  Lydia,  of  C 6/C5:  obv. cock;  rev.  quadripartite  incuse  square.

Byz. 137.2), (IG i\u00b3  284.20),  h (IG i\u00b3  283.iii.16), (Krateros  fr. 23,  Krech). Assos  is  not  called  a  polis  by  Archaic  or  Classical  sources, but  Steph.  Byz. 136.7  retrospectively  (and  erroneously)  calls 1004 mitchell it  a .  This  passage,  which  does  not  identify his  source,  refers  to  Assos  as  a  polis  in  an  urban  sense, and  in  a  political  sense  as  the  second  city  of  Aiolis.  That Assos  was  a  polis  at  least  in  the  Classical  period  is  indicated by  its  membership  of  the  Delian  League  and  its  coinage (infra). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally by  the  tribute  lists  of  the  Delian  League  (infra)  and  internal- ly  by C 5s  coins  (infra).  Individually,  the  external  city-ethnic is  attested  in  OGIS 221  ( 274),  and  it  is  used  for  the  Stoic Kleanthes  (born  331)  in,  e.g.,  Plut.  De  exil. 599A  and  Diog. Laert. 7.168. The  territory of  Assos  may  have included  the  poleis  of Gargara  and  Lamponeion  (Leaf  ( 1923)  253\u00ad57),  the  former having  been  founded  by  Assians  (Strabo  13.1.58). According  to Hellan.  fr. 160,  Assos  was  founded  from Lesbos  by  Aiolians,  and  according  to  Myrsilos  ((FGrHist 477)  fr. 17)  by  Methymna  (both  apud  Strabo  13.1.58); Alexander  Polyhistor.  fr. 137  (FGrHist 118,fr.  96),  in  a  com- mentary  on  Alkman,  referred  to Assos  as  an   (Steph.  Byz. 136.12).  It retained  the  character of  an  Aiolic  city,  as  is  shown  by  the  survival  of  the  cult  in imperial  times  of  Zeus  Homoloios,  which  is  common  in Boiotia  (IGR iv  256;see RE  viii. 2263\u00ad64  and  xa. 244).A  prior Lelegian  population  is  referred  to  in  Hom.  Il. 10.429,  noted by Strabo 13.1.58. Assos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Ionian  district  and  is  registered  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3 259.iv.9)  to  427/6  or 426/5  (IG i\u00b3  284.20)  a  total  of  eight times,  twice  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.9).  It was  presumably  assessed  for  tribute  in  410/9 (Krateros  fr. 23,Krech  IG i\u00b3  100). Assos  was  ruled  by  the  tyrants  Euboulos,  c. 360,  and  his eunuch/slave  Hermias,  who  died  in  344  and  was  based  at Atarneus  in  Aiolis  (Strabo  13.1.57;  see  Leaf  ( 1923)  295\u00ad97).  In C 4m  the  tyrant  \u00b5  with  his  associates  was  an  equal partner  in  a  treaty  with  Erythrai  (I.Erythrai 9).  Hermias  was resident  at  Assos  from  348  to 345  (see  the  sources  in  Leaf ( 1923)  299). The  Archaic  city  temple  on  the  acropolis,  rebuilt  in  C 4, was  probably  dedicated  to  Athena  Polias;  see  coin  types  and I.Assos 14.iii:        (first c entu- ry ad).  It was  Doric,  with  six  by thirteen  columns,  pronaos in  antis,  and  an  enclosed  cella.  The  architraves  and  metopes were  decorated  with  scenes  from  the  Herakles  cycle (Westcoat  ( 1987);  St\u00fcpperich  ( 1996)). Fortifications built from polygonal masonry of  the Archaic(?)  period  were  succeeded  by  well-preserved  ashlar walls  of  C 4(?);  Lang  ( 1996)  223;  Schulz  ( 2000)  16.  These  con- tained  two  main  gateways  with  square  towers,  seven  smaller gates,  one  round  and  numerous  square  towers,  and  enclosed an  area  of  a  little  more  than  55  ha  (PECS).  The  acropolis  was separately  fortified.  The  city  was  besieged  by  the  Persian satraps  Autophradates  and  Maussolos  in  365  (Xen.  Ages. 2.26). A  cemetery  with  burials  dating  between  C 6  and  C 4  has been  excavated  on  either  side  of  a  paved  street  outside  the west  gate  (St\u00fcpperich  ( 1994)).  Domestic  housing  of  C 6\u00adC5 is  also  recorded.  Other  public  buildings,  including  an  agora with  stoas,  a  bouleuterion,  a  theatre  (destroyed  in  the  nine- teenth  century),  as  well  as  fountain  houses  and  drainage  sys- tems  date  mostly  to  the  Hellenistic  period  (PECS). Three  periods  can  be  distinguished  when  Assos  minted coins.  ( 1)  Silver,  c. 479\u00ad450:  obv.  griffin;  rev.  lion's  head.

The  name  of  the  territory  was   `  (Leaf  ( 1923) 157).  It probably  extended  west  and  south  to the  river troas  1013 Simoeis,  and  east  to  Ophryneion.  It  included  the  burial tumulus  of  Ajax  (whose  statue  was  returned  to  the Rhoiteians  by  Augustus  (Strabo  13.1.30),  and  an  unlocated colony  called  ,  which  was  renamed  \u00b5  in Strabo's day  (Strabo  13.1.42). Rhoiteion  was  founded  by  Dorians  from  Astypalaia,  who also  founded  the  undefended  colony  of  Polion,  in  C 7/C6, which  was  demolished  soon  afterwards  (Strabo  13.1.42). Rhoiteion  was  one  of  the     in  the  Delian League  and  was  assessed  for  tribute  of 8  tal.  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3 71.iii.124,  126,  toponym restored)  and  for  an  unknown amount  in  422/1  (IG i\u00b3  77.iv.14  and 16).  In  424  it  was  briefly seized  by  refugees  from  Mytilene  and  other  refugees  from Lesbos,  but  returned  on  payment  of 2,000  Phokaian  staters (Thuc. 4.52.2).     `  was  hon- oured  in  a  C 3f  proxeny  decree  of  Delos  (IG xi.4582).  It  was absorbed  by  Ilion  in  a  synoecism  after  189  (Livy  38.37). The  acropolis  is  reported  to  be  fortified on three sides with  two  towers  (undated);  the  fourth  side  was  precipitous. There  were  buildings  within  the  acropolis,  while  the  lower town  extends  to  the  south  (Cook  ( 1973)  77\u00ad90).

The  collective city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  C 6  by Syll. \u00b3i.2,and  exter- nally  in  C 5  by  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (infra)  and  IG i\u00b3  17 (C 5m/s),  which  is  a  decree  granting  privileges  to  the  city. Individually,  the  city-ethnic  is  applied  externally  in  I.Kios 1 (C 4)  and  by  later  sources  to  the  C 5  historian  from  the  city, Damastes  (  FGrHist 5;  cf.  Test. 1,  2,  4). Its  territory  is  termed  by  Hdt. 5.94.2.Sigeion and  Rhoiteion  included  the  former  territory of  Ilion,  until that  city  was  refounded  (Strabo  13.1.42).  In  the  early  C 6  con- trol  of  Sigeion  was  contested  between  Athenians  and Mytilenians;  the  latter's  base  was  the  neighbouring  polis  of Achilleion  (Hdt. 5.94.2).  The  oecist  may  have  been  the Athenian,  Physkon,  in  C 7l,  when  virtually  the  entire  rest  of the  Troad  was  controlled  by Lesbos  (Strabo  13.1.8). Sigeion  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  from  450/49 (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.25)  to  418/17  (IG i\u00b3  287.ii.9)  a  total  of  fifteen times,  once  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1,000  dr. (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.25)  down to 418/17,  when  it  paid  1  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 287.ii.9).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.93). In C 4,  Tenedos  claimed  control  over  Sigeion  (Arist.  Rh. 1375b31;  Anon.  in  Arist.  Artem  Rhet. 81.12).  Strabo  13.1.39  (cf. 13.1.31)  says  that  the  city  was  demolished  ( ) by the  people  of  Ilion  on  account  of  its  disobedience.  The  date must  fall  between  c. 334  and  Strabo's own  time. Sigeion  was  usually  ruled  by  an  autocrat  or  a  tyrant: Physkon,  Athenian  Olympic  victor,  in  late  C 7  (Strabo 13.1.38);  Hegesistratos,  son  of  Peisistratos,  in  520s,  and  per- haps  Hippias  in  510  (Hdt. 5.94.1);  Chares  son  of  Theochares between  c. 355  and 334  (Theopomp.  fr. 105  apud  Ath. 12.532B; Arr. 1.12.1;  schol.  Dem. 3.21).  A  public  decree  of  C 2  has  been recorded  (Daux  ( 1956);  cf.  BE  ( 1958)  410). A  prytaneion  is  mentioned  in  C 6  (Syll. \u00b32A).The  city  walls were  reputed  to  have  been  built  with  stones  from  Ilion  by Archianax  of  Mytilene  in  C 6  (Strabo  13.1.38).There  was  a  C 6 dedication  of  crater,  base  and  stand  by  Phanodikos  of  Prokonnesos  (Syll. \u00b32).  A  C 4  decree  of  Kios  gave  proxeny status  and  minor  privileges  to     (I.Kios 1). Silver  and  bronze  coins  were  minted  in  C 4,  probably when  Sigeion  was  controlled  by  Chares,  c. 355\u00ad334.

Gargara  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ephor.  fr. 47 and  is  implied  to  be  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  the inscription  for  Malousios  of  Gargara  of 306  (I.Ilion 1.4\u00ad5,  17, 22,  etc.).  The  collective  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on C 5s  coins  (infra)  and  externally  on  C 5  and  C 4  inscriptions (IG i\u00b3  270.i.34;  Michel 522.22).The  external  individual  use  of the  city-ethnic  is  found  in  a  Chian  C 4  list  of  proxenoi  (PEP Chios 50.12)  and  in  the  inscription  of  Ilion  for  Malousios (Michel  522.3,  etc.).  The  name  became  the  butt  of  jokes  in the  later  C 5.  Alkaios  comicus  fr. 19,  Kock,  refers  to ' ,  and  Ar.  Ach. 3  to \u00b5\u00b5  (Leaf ( 1923)  263). The  city  territory  was  known  as  (Strabo 13.1.58)  and  was  proverbial  for  its  fertility  (Verg.  G. 1.103;Sen. Phoen. 608;Macrob.  Sat. v.20.15\u00ad16;  cf.  Tenger  ( 1994)  150 n. 91). Gargara  was  a     (Strabo  13.1.5;  cf.  Steph. Byz. 128.22,  who  also  cites  Hecat.  fr. 224),  founded  from Assos  (Strabo  13.1.58),  although  the  indigenous  population was  Lelegian  (Strabo  13.1.58,  interpreting  Hom.  Il. 10.428). Gargara  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Ionian  district  and  is  recorded  from  452/1  (IG i\u00b3  261.v.22) to 428/7  (IG i\u00b3  283.iii.22)  a  total  of  eight  times,  twice  com- pletely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of  either  4,500  dr.  (IG i\u00b3 261.v.22)  or  4,660  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  270.i.34).It  was  assessed  for  trib- ute  in  410/9  (IG i\u00b3  100.ii.6).  In  C 4l  it  was  a  member  of  the confederation  of  Athena  Ilias  (Michel  522).  The  site  was relocated  from  Palaigargara  on  a  mountain  peak  to  a  coastal site  at  an  unspecified period,  either  before  C 5  (so  ATL  i. 477) or  in  the  Hellenistic  period  later  than  the  composition  of  the epigram  of  Aratos  (Anth.  Pal. 9.437;  so  Leaf  ( 1923)  262). Demetrios  of  Skepsis  apud  Strabo  13.1.58  reports  that colonists  were  brought  from  Miletoupolis  by  the  kings,  so that  the  population  became  semi-barbarous  rather  than Aiolic.  This  was  presumably  in  the  Hellenistic  period. The  mountain-top  site  was  defended  by  fortification walls  of  the  Archaic  period  (St\u00fcpperich  ( 1995);  cf.  Schulz ( 2000)  28),  and  included  a  walled  acropolis  area  with  foun- dations  of  a  temple.  Hom.  Il. 8.48  reports  a  cult  of  Zeus  at  the summit.  Architectural  remains  include  an  Aiolic  capital  and a  mid-C 6  relief  of  an  armed  warrior,  which  may  have  served as  a  column  (St\u00fcpperich  ( 1995),  correcting  and  adding  to Cook  ( 1973)  255\u00ad61).  It was  on  the  route  of  the  Delphic  theorodokoi  c. 200  (Plassart  ( 1921)  8;  Cook  ( 1988)  15).  A  citizen  of  Gargara  is  listed  in  a  C 4  list  of  proxenoi  from  Chios (RPh  ( 1937)  325\u00ad32  no. 6A.12). Gargara  minted  silver  and  bronze  coins.

The  city-ethnics  are  (IG i\u00b3 280.ii.12  ( 432/1))  or  (Xen.  Hell. 3.1.18;Strabo 13.1.51;  cf.  Cook  ( 1988)  14  n. 23). Neandreia  was  one  of  the  Aiolic  cities  of  the  Troas  (Xen. Hell. 3.1.16).In Ps.-Skylax  96  Neandreia  is  the  third  toponym listed  after  the  heading      ... .  It  is called  a  polis  in  the  urban  and  political  senses  combined  by Xen.  Hell. 3.1.16.  The  collective  city-ethnic  is  used  internally on  C 5\u00adC4  coins  (infra)  and  externally  on  the  Athenian  trib- ute  lists  (infra).  The  name  of  the  territory  was   (Strabo  10.3.20,following  Demetrios  of  Skepsis).  It  included the  Samonion  plain,  which  was  probably  to  the  east  of  the city  in  the  Skamandros  valley  (Cook  ( 1973)  315).  It over- looked  and  presumably  adjoined  Hamaxitos  on  the  west (Strabo  13.1.51). A  foundation  story  is  recorded  in  Dictys  Cretensis,  which may  originate  with  C 5  or  C 4  sources,  before  the  foundation of Alexandreia  Troas  (Schwertheim  ( 1994)  21\u00ad24). Neandreia  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  first b y toponym (IG i\u00b3  263.ii.34),  later  by  city-ethnic  (IG i\u00b3 280.ii.12),  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.10)  to  430/29  (IG i\u00b3 281.iii.37)  a  total  of  twelve  times,  twice  completely  restored, paying  a  phoros  of 2,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.10)  in  all  years.  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.81)  and  in  410/9 (IG i\u00b3  100.iii.4).  It  was  one  of  the  cities  incorporated  in Alexandreia  Troas  in  310. The  origin  of  the  civic  centre  (temple,  agora,  stoa)  dates to  the  Archaic  period,  including  a  C 6  temple,  perhaps  dedi- cated  to Apollo  (Wiegartz  ( 1994)),  an  agora  and  stoa,  possi- ble  remains  of  a  theatre  (Trunk  ( 1994)),  extensive  housing and  a  complex  internal  drainage  system.  The  western  sec- tion  of  the  housing  area  was  built  on  a  rectangular  organised grid  dating  to  C 4  (Maischatz  ( 1994)).  There  was  a  fortified area  at  the  west  end  of  the  site,  arguably  protected  by  the  ear- liest  fortifications of  C 6.  These  were  built  from  2\u00ad2.5  m- thick  rough  polygonal  masonry,  not  laid  in  horizontal  or even  courses;  they  had  five entrances.  New  walls  were  built in  late  C 5  or  early  C 4.They  were  3.2  km  long  and  2.9  m  thick, made  from  granite  ashlar  blocks.  There  were  eight  gates  and eleven  rectangular  towers,  two  with  interior  courtyards (Schulz  ( 1994),  ( 2000)).  These  walls  may  be  indirectly referred to  at Xen.  Hell. 3.1.16  (      ... ... ). The  city  minted  silver  and  bronze  issues  from  c. 430\u00ad310: denominations:  drachm,  hemidrachm,  obol,  hemiobol: obv.  head  of  Apollo,  or  helmet;  rev.  altar  and  laurel  tree,  or ram,  or  horse,  or  triskeles,  or  ear  of  corn;  legend: or (Head,  HN \u00b2547;  cf.

Located at  Vouno  c. 1  km  east  of  Solinarion  (Knauss  ( 1987)  42\u00ad68). Size of  territory: 1.  Type:  C.  The  toponym  is  \u00b5  , (Strabo  9.2.27;  Paus. 9.33.5).  Apart  from  Steph.  Byz. 68.19, there  is  no  attestation  of  a  city-ethnic. The  only  author  to  call  Alalkomenai  a  polis  is  Strabo,  who retrospectively  describes  the  site  as  a  small  polis  situated  in  a plain  ( 9.2.36).  According  to  Paus. 9.33.5,  the  settlement  was just  a  \u00b5.  But  it  may  deserve  inclusion  in  this  inventory of  poleis  because  it  seems  to  have  had  a  territory  of  its  own, and  especially  because  of  its  famous  sanctuary  of  Athena,  \u00b5  (IG ix\u00b2.1  170.5  (C 4l\u00adC3e))  dedicated  to  the cult  of \u00b5   (Hom.  Il. 4.8;  see  Schachter ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 111\u00ad14).  According  to  Steph.  Byz. 68.18\u00ad19,  the goddess  had  the  epithet  Polias,  and  her  cult  was  linked  with that  of  Zeus  Polieus  (Etym.  Magn. 56.8\u00ad10;Schachter ( 1981\u00ad94)  iii. 96).  Since  the  sanctuary  was  in  the  lowlands (Paus. 9.33.5),  the  epithets  Polias  and  Polieus  must  refer  not to  an  acropolis  cult  but  rather  to  cults  of  divinities  protect- ing  the  polis  (cf.  Cole  ( 1995)  301\u00ad3).  The  cult  of  Athena  at  the Alalkomenion  was  presumably  an  old  one  (Schachter ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 12),  which  would  indicate  that  at  least  in  the Archaic  period  Alalkomenai  was  probably  a  polis  (Hansen ( 1995a)  32\u00ad33)  with  the  cult  of  its  protecting  god  located  in an  extra-mural  sanctuary.  Later  Alalkomenai  was  incorpo- rated  into  Koroneia  (no. 210).  The  territory is  called \u00b5;  it  must  have  been  very  small,  but  at  least  it included  the  fortified mountain T ilphosion  (Ephor.  fr. 153; Diod. 19.53.7).The  Alalkomenion  was  located  c. 300  m  north of  Alalkomenai  (Knauss  ( 1987)  50). 200.

The  city-ethnic  is (F.Delphes iii.4148  (C 5f);  Xen.  Hell. 4.2.20). At Hes.  Op. 222, probably  denotes  Thespiai.  In sources  of  the  Classical  period  Thespiai  is  called  a  polis  in  the urban  sense  (Hdt. 8.50.2;Xen.  Hell. 6.3.1;Dem.  16.25)  and  in the  political  sense  (IG i\u00b3  72.6,  16  (C 5l);  Xen.  Hell. 5.4.46;  Hell. Oxy. 19.2\u00ad3;Isoc.  8.17;Dem.  16.25). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  a  proxeny  decree  of  C 3m  (SEG 32  496.2\u00ad3)  and  externally on  the  Serpent  Column  (ML  27.6: ~(479)).The indi- vidual  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  an Athenian  proxeny  decree  of  C 5m  for  four  named  Thespians (IG i\u00b3  23)  and  in  Delphic  inscriptions  where  a  Thespian appears  as  naopoios  at  Delphi  in  334  (CID ii  79A.15).  In  the feminine,  the  ktetikon is  sometimes  used  (IG ii\u00b2 8834  (C 4)).  Patra  (  patris)  has  been  restored  in  CEG ii  788 (c. 350). The  territory is  called     (Thuc. 4.76.3);     (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.42)  or  just   (Xen.  Hell. 6.4.4);  Anth.  Pal. iii.19.2  (r 480)  has  . During  the  First  Federation,  Thespiai  constituted  two  of  the eleven  Boiotian  districts  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3),  including  Siphai (no. 218)  (Thuc. 4.76.3),  Leuktra  (Xen.  Hell. 6.4.4),  Eutresis (no. 205)  and  Thisbai  (no. 223;  Hell.  Oxy. 19.3),  Chorsiai  (no. 202)  (SEG 24  361,  but  cf. 47  520),  Kreusis  (Ps.-Skylax  38,as restored  by  Roesch  ( 1980);  Livy  36.21.5;but Xen.  Hell. 6.4.3 shows  that  in  371  it  belonged  to  Thebes),  Askra  (Hes.  Op. 639\u00ad40  with 222;Arist.fr.580),Keressos  (Paus. 9.14.1\u00ad4;Plut. Cam. 19.4;  Mor. 866F),  Donakon  (Paus. 9.31.7)  and  perhaps Hippotai  (Plut.  Mor 775A;  Schachter  ( 1996a)  104).Including the  dependent  poleis  of  Chorsiai,  Thisbai,  Siphai  and Eutresis  (no. 205),  its  territory  covered  c. 425  km \u00b2.  Excluding these,  it  came  to  some  200  km \u00b2.  Thespiai  bordered  on Haliartos  (no. 206)  to  the  north,  on  Thebes  to  the  east  (Hdt. 5.79.2),  on  Plataiai  (no. 216)  to  the  south-east  (Hdt. 8.50.2), and  on  Thisbai  to  the  south-west  (Xen.  Hell. 6.4.3\u00ad4). Thespiai  was  allied  with  Thebes  in  506  and  earlier  (Hdt. 5.79.2).Seven  hundred  Thespians  were  killed  at  Thermopylai in 480  (Hdt. 7.202.1;  cf.  Anth.  Pal. iii.19),  and  the  Thespians fled t o  the  Peloponnese  when  the  Persians  attacked  Boiotia and  burned  down the  city  of  Thespiai  (Hdt. 8.50.2).  A  force of 1,800  light-armed  Thespians  fought  in  the  battle  of Plataiai  in  479  (Hdt. 9.30.1),  and  the  Thespians  are  duly recorded  on  the  Serpent  Column  commemorating  the  victo- ry  (ML 27.6).  Thespiai  was  resettled  and  the  Thespians admitted  extra  citizens  to  make  up  for  the  losses  during  the war  (Hdt. 8.75.5;  Schachter  ( 1996a)  115).  The  city  was  a  mem- ber  of  the  First  Federation  and  provided  two  Boiotarchs (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3\u00ad4).  The  Thespians  suffered  severe  losses  in 424  in  the  battle  of  Delion  (Thuc. 4.96.3,  133.1)  and  101  names are  recorded  in  the  public  funeral  monument  set  up  after  the battle  (IG vii  1888).  The  Thespians  fought  in  the  Boiotian army  in  the  battle  of  the  Nemea  in  394  (Xen.  Hell. 4.2.20;  cf. SEG 2186,47  519).Thespiai  was  garrisoned  by  the  Spartans  in 379  and 378,  under  the  supremacy  of  a  harmost  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.15,  41),  but  by  the  mid- 370s  Thebes  had  regained  control of  the  neighbouring  poleis,  probably  including  Thespiai (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.63).  By  372  the  Thespians  had  been  forced  by the  Thebans  to  join  the  Second  Federation  (Isoc. 14.9:    ),  providing  one  Boiotarch  (SEG 25  553.14  (C 4f:  for  the  date,  see  SEG 45  431  and  Vott\u00e9ro  ( 2001) 71)).  Before  the  autumn  of 371  (Xen.  Hell. 6.3.5,  6.4.10)  the city  was  sacked  by  the  Thebans  and  depopulated  (Diod. 15.46.6;  Isoc. 6.27;Dem.  16.4,  25,  28).  The  Thespians,  or  some of  them,  withdrew  to  nearby  Keressos  (Paus. 9.14.2),  but probably  only  after  the  sack  of  Thespiai  (Tuplin  ( 1986) 333\u00ad34;  Buck  ( 1994)  110  with  n. 46).  In  359,however,a Thespian  theorodokos  hosted  theoroi  sent  from  Epidauros (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.194.a.6),  and  Aischylos  of  Thespiai  was  a victor  in  the  Olympic  Games,  probably  in  348  (IAG 26; Olympionikai 444);  so  Demosthenes'  contention  ( 19.325) that  the  city  was  still  not  rebuilt  in  346  must  be  taken  with  a grain  of  salt.  The  Thespians  took  an  active  part  in  the destruction  of  Thebes  in  335  (Diod. 17.13.5),  and  in  C 3e  the city  was  resettled  (Plut.  Dem. 39.5;  IG vii  1747  and 1751,  mili- tary  catalogues  of  C 3e). The  constitution  of  Thespiai  was  oligarchic  and  based  on a  property qualification ( Hell.  Oxy. 19.3;Xen.  Hell. 5.4.46).A democratic  uprising  in  414  was  immediately  quelled  by  the Thebans  (Thuc. 6.95.2;Gehrke,  Stasis 172).  In  378  the  consti- tution  is  classified as a d ynasteia,  and  the  democratic  faction as  living  in  exile  in  Thebes  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.46).  The  principal body  of  government  was  a  boule,  to  which  only  propertied citizens  were  admitted  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.2,  3).  An  eponymous boiotia  457 archon  is  attested  c. 386  (SEG 24  361.3;  Sherk  ( 1990)  287).  The Aristotelian  collection  of  politeiai  included  a  Constitution  of Thespiai  (Heracl.  Lemb. 76  no. 59,  Gigon).  Thespian  cit- izens  were  appointed  proxenoi  by  Athens  (no. 361)  (IG i\u00b3  23) and  Delphi  (no. 177)  (F.Delphes iii.196  ( 318\u00ad306),416  (C 4l)). Apollo  Archegetas  seems  to  have  been  the  protecting  god of  Thespiai.  His  cult  was  associated  with  the  foundation  of the  polis,  and  was  performed  in  a  Doric  peristyle  temple  of C 5,  c. 2  km  south-west  of  Thespiai  (SEG 2237  (C 5f); Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 88\u00ad89,(1996a)  103).Other  major  cults attested  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  are  the  nine Muses,  whose  sanctuary  was  in  the  Valley  of  the  Muses  c. 6 km  west  of  Thespiai  (Hes.  Op. 654\u00ad59;  Paus. 9.30.1  (rC 4e); Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  ii. 151\u00ad58),  Herakles  (BCH 50  ( 1926) 390.4;  SEG 15  324  (C 5f);  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  ii. 34\u00ad35), Dionysos  (IG vii  1794  (C 5);  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 192\u00ad95), Zeus  Karaios  (SEG 32  505  (C 4l));  Zeus  Saotes  (Anth.  Pal. 6.344  ( 330/29);  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  iii. 150\u00ad53),  and  the Daimones  (Michel  1102  (c. 300);  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 149). Surveys  have  shown  that  \"the  early  city  consisted  of  at least  four  separate  nuclei,  spread  out  over  a  total  area  of about 100  ha\".  In  C 5  and  C 4  they  were  merged  together  into one  large  conurbation  (Snodgrass  ( 1987\u00ad89)  57).Remains  of the  Geometric  and  Archaic  periods,  however,  are  scarce,  and it  has  been  suggested  that  the  centre  of  Thespiai  before  480 was  at  the  temple  of  Apollo,  and  that  the  settlement  was moved  to  its  Classical  site  only  after  the  Persian  destruction in 480  (Schachter  ( 1996a)  103\u00ad4). The  walls  were  demolished  by  the  Thebans  in  423  (Thuc. 4.133.1),re-erected  with  Spartan  help  in  378  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.41), demolished  once  more  by  the  Thebans  (Dem. 6.30;Isoc. 14.19,  35),  probably  before  373/2  (the  date  of  Isoc.  Plat.)  and not  yet  rebuilt  in  343  (Dem. 19.112).  Three  huge  square  blocks of  the  Classical  city  wall  were  discovered  in  1987  (Bintliff  and Snodgrass  ( 1988)  67).  The  settlements  covered  an  area  of  at least 50  and  perhaps  more  than  100  ha  (Bintliff  ( 1997a)  243). Thespiai  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard  from c. 500  to 480  and  from  386  (or  earlier)  to  374  (or  later),  and bronze  coins  from  c. 338  to 315.(1)  Silver,  c. 500\u00ad480,  denomina- tions:  stater,  drachm,  hemidrachm,  obol;  obv.

( 23,  CGM i.104  (C 3s));  that  it  was  a  polis  in  the  political sense  as  well  is  apparent  from  the  fact  that      appears  c. 285\u00ad280  among  the aphedriateuontes  (IG vii  2723.4).  That  its  status  as  a  polis  in the  political  sense  stems  at  least  from  the  beginning  of  the Third  Federation  (i.e.  from  338)  is  indicated  by  the  eight  vic- tories  at  the  four  major  Panhellenic  games  won  c. 300  by  the pankratist  Nikon  of  Anthedon  (Steph.

Mor. 300F: (rC 5);  and  Steph.  Byz. 96.18\u00ad19 ,  \u00b5,  (rC 4). The  territory is  called  (Strabo 9.2.13) and its size  has  been  assessed  at  c. 85  km \u00b2  (Fossey  ( 1988)  250). 438 hansen Anthedon  bordered  on  Tanagra (no. 220)  to  the  south-east (Nicocrates  (FGrHist 376  fr. 1)  and  on  Thebes  (no. 221)  to  the south-west  (Heracl.  Cret. 23,  GGM i.104).  Herakleides  tells us  that  the  soil  was  poor  and  that  almost  all  the  inhabitants lived  as  fishermen (Heracl.  Cret. 23,  GGM i.104;  cf. Archestratos  fr. 15.1).  Although  there  is  no  explicit  evidence, it  is  usually  assumed  that  Anthedon  belonged  to  Thebes  (no. 221)  and  that  its  harbour  was  used  as  a  naval  base  by  the Thebans  when  in  the  360s  they  built  a  fleet (Schl\u00e4ger e t  al. ( 1968\u00ad69)  90),  but  see  Fossey  ( 1992)  117\u00ad20).  The  attestation of  an  aphedriateuon  from  Anthedon  testifies t o  membership of  the  Third  Federation  (IG vii  2723.4  (c. 280\u00ad270)). The  protecting  god  of  Anthedon  was  probably  Zeus Karaios  and  Anthas,  whose  cult,  however,  is  unattested before  C 2  (IG ii\u00b2  2360;  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  iii. 97  and  letter of  Dec. 1994). The  ancient  town  lay  beside  the  sea  around  a  tiny  harbour (Strabo  9.2.13;  Schl\u00e4ger  et al.( 1968\u00ad69)).A  separately  fortified hill  about  30  m  high  was  used  for  the  acropolis.  On  the  north side  of  the  hill  are  the  remains  of  a  Hellenistic  (Roesch  ( 1976)) fortification wall built in ashlar masonry w ith  interval  tow- ers.  The  city  walls  encompassed  both  the  hill  and  the  harbour and  enclosed  an  area  of 30  ha  (Wallace  ( 1979)  58;  Bintliff ( 1997a)  244).  Herakleides  mentions  an  agora  flanked w ith two  stoas.  The  settlement  can  be  traced  back  to  the  Neolithic period,  and  there  are  remains  of  the  Geometric,  Archaic  and Classical  periods  (Fossey  ( 1988)  255). 201. ", "Oropos": "Identifier: 215. , was  an Athenian  dependency  (Thuc. 2.23.3),  but  in  412/11  the  city was  conquered  by  the  Boiotians,  assisted  by  some  Oropians (Thuc. 8.60.1;Gehrke,Stasis  125),and  enjoyed  a  short  period of  independence  (Lys. 31.9)  until  402,when  the  losing  side  in a  civil  war  appealed  to  Thebes.  The  Thebans  captured  the city  and  forced  its  population  to  leave  their  settlement  on the  coast  and  move  7  stades  inland.  The  Oropians  were  first allowed  to  retain  their  political  institutions,  probably  as  a Theban  dependency,  but  after  a  few  years  Oropos  was annexed  to  the  Boiotian  Federation  and  all  Oropians  were made  citizens  of  Thebes  (Diod. 14.17.1\u00ad3;  Theopomp.  fr. 12). When  the  Boiotian  federation  was  dissolved  in  386  after  the King's  Peace,  Oropos  must  have  regained  its  independence, but  some  time  between  375  and 373  the  Oropians  preferred to  join  Athens  once  again  rather  than  be  forced  by  Thebes  to join  the  new  Boiotian  Federation  (Isoc. 14.20,  37;  Knoepfler ( 1986b)  90\u00ad93;  SEG 36  442).  Already  in  366  (Diod. 15.76.1), however,  Oropos  was  captured  by  the  Eretrian  tyrants (Aeschin. 3.85;Dem.  18.99).  Faced  with  the  threat  of  a  major Athenian  attack,  they  agreed  to  hand  over  Oropos  to  the Thebans  and  submit  to  international  arbitration.  The Thebans  garrisoned  the  city,  but  the  arbitration  came  to nothing,  and  Thebes  annexed  Oropos  once  again  (Xen.  Hell. 7.4.1;Diod.  15.76.1;  schol.  Dem. 18.99,  176,  Dilts; 21.64,  204, Dilts).  Two  proxeny  decrees  passed  by  the  Oropians  in  their ekklesia  (RO  75  A\u00adB)  in  probably  359/8  (Coulton  ( 1968)  182) strongly  suggest  that  Oropos,  though  depending  on  Thebes, was  still  a  polis,  and  not  just  a  municipality  (Hansen  ( 1995a) 39).  After  the  defeat  at  Chaironeia,  Oropos  was  transferred to  Athens,  perhaps  already  by  Philip  in  338  (Paus. 1.34.1; schol.  Dem. 18.99,  176,  Dilts;  Robert  ( 1960)  195),  perhaps only  in  335  after  Alexander's  destruction  of  Thebes (Knoepfler ( 1993)  295).  During  this  period  Oropos  was ruled  by  a  demarchos  (IG ii\u00b2  1672.272\u00ad3).Oropos  regained  its independence  in  322,had  it  confirmed in  319  (Diod. 18.56.6), but  became  a  member  of  the  Third  Boiotian  Federation  in the  years  312\u00ad304  (Diod. 19.78.3;  IG vii  2724a.5  (c. 280\u00ad270)). In C 4s  Oropos  awarded  proxenia  to a  member  of  the Makedonian  royal  family  and  to a  Makedonian  nobleman (I.Oropos 1\u00ad2). Remains  of  an  undated  fortification wall enclosing the acropolis  are  still  visible  along  the  west  side,  but  only  as  a  fall in  the  land  with  some  debris.  All  remains  of  ancient  structures have  disappeared  (Fossey  ( 1988)  30  and  letter  of  Jan. 1995). Oropos  was  famous  for  its  sanctuary  of  Amphiaraos  situ- ated  east  of  the  city.  The  Amphiareion  was  originally  an underground  oracle,  allegedly  consulted  by  Kroisos  of  Lydia (Hdt. 1.46.2)  and  by  Mys  of  Persia  (Hdt. 8.134),  in  C 4s  by Euxenippos  on  behalf  of  the  Athenian  polis  (Hyp. 3.14\u00ad17).It was  rebuilt  and  reorganised  in  C 5s  as  a  predominantly  iatro- mantic  sanctuary  (Ar.  fr. 21,  PCG)  administered  by  a  hiereus and  a  neokoros  (I.Oropos 276\u00ad77  (C 4f);  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94) i. 19\u00ad26;  Petrakos  ( 1968)  61\u00ad129).  The  visible  remains  are mostly  of  C 5l\u00adC4s,  and  include  a  temple,  an  altar,  separate baths  for  men  and  women,  a  small  theatre,  a  Doric  stoa  and a  larger  theatre  behind  the  stoa  (I.Oropos 290\u00ad93  (C 4s); Petrakos  ( 1974)  26\u00ad57;  Travlos  ( 1988)  301\u00ad18). In 329/8  the  Athenians  instituted  the  Great  Amphiaraia  as a  Panhellenic  quadrennial  festival  with  competitions  in  athletics  and  music  (I.Oropos 298).  A  contemporary  list  of victors  records  participants  from,  e.g.  Sinope  (no. 729), Kolophon  (no. 848),Argos  (no. 347)  and  Thebes  (no. 221)  in addition  to  numerous  Athenians  (no. 361)  (IG vii 414  I.Oropos 520;  cf.  Knoepfler ( 1993)). 215. ", "Siphai": "Identifier: 219. , (Siphaieus) Map  55.Lat.38.10,long.23.05.Size of  territory: 1.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is  ,  (Thuc. 4.76.2),  but  the  singular  form  is  also  attested  (Steph.  Byz. 573.1),  and  according  to  Paus. 9.32.4  the  toponym  was  . The  toponym  denotes  either  the  town  (Thuc. 4.76.3)  or  the territory  (Arist.  Part.  an. 696a5).  The  only  preserved  attesta- tion  of  the  city-ethnic  is  (IG vii  207  Michel 170 (C 3s)). Siphai  is  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  by  Thuc. 4.76.2\u00ad3,  89.2  (cf.  Hansen  ( 1995a)  21\u00ad23),  and  in  the  urban sense  implicitly  at  Ps.-Skylax  38,  where   \u00b5  is a  convincing  emendation  of  MSS    \u00b5.In Ps.-Skylax  \u00b5,  an  ellipsis  of   \u00b5 (Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  142,  145),  invariably goes  with  the  preceding  and  not  the  following  toponym (pace  M\u00fcller  in  GGM). The  territory is  called  (Arist.  Part.  an. 696a5; Schwandner  ( 1977)  519\u00ad20).  It  constituted  the  coastal  region of  the  territory  of  Thespiai  (no. 222)  (Thuc. 4.76.3),  and  its size  has  been  assessed  at  c. 25  km \u00b2  (Fossey  ( 1988)  134).  Steph. Byz. 573.1  calls  Siphai  an    .A C 4f inventory  of  Thespian  hestiatorion  equipment  includes some  in  Siphai  (SEG 24  361.25),  which  supports  the  assump- tion  that  Siphai  was  a  dependent  polis  in  Thespian  territory. From  the  abortive  attempt  in  424  to introduce  a  demo- cracy,  we  can  infer  that  Siphai  must  have  had  an  oligarchic constitution.  The  democratic  faction  was  supported  by Athens,  but  the  stasis  was  quelled  by  armed  assistance  from the  other  Boiotians  (Thuc. 4.76.2\u00ad3,  89.2,  101.3;  Hansen ( 1995a)  21\u00ad24). Siphai  was  walled  in  424  ( :  Thuc. 4.76.3).  The existing  circuit  in  ashlar  masonry  with  square  towers  (of which  seven  are  preserved)  encloses  both  the  acropolis  and the  settlement  below  to  the  north,  east  and  south.  A  wall  to the  south  separated  the  acropolis  from  the  lower  city.  To  the west  was  the  Corinthian  Gulf,  and  no  traces  of  a  wall  have been  found  here.  The  wall  is  of  C 4  and,  partly  for  historical reasons,  Schwandner  suggests  a  date  between  363  and 330, but  the  nearby  tower  at  Mavrovouni  (Ano-Siphai)  from c. 400  points  to  earlier  fortifications at S iphai  as  well (Schwandner  ( 1977)  548\u00ad51).  The  circuit  encloses  an  area  of c. 3  ha,  of  which  only  a  part  was  used  for  settlement.  The  har- bour  was  presumably  to  the  south  of  the  city.  The  settlement can  be  traced  back  to EH  i\u00adii,  and  there  are  remains  of  the Geometric,  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  (Fossey  ( 1988) 171). Siphai  had  no  mint,  but  stray  finds on the acropolis of Thespian  coins  (Schwandner  ( 1977)  547  n. 32)  may  suggest that  such  coins  were  legal  tender  in  Siphai. 219. ", "Tanagra": "Identifier: 221. , (Tanagraios) Map  55.  Lat. 38.20,long.  23.35. Size of  territory: 5.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is  , (ML 35,  36  Lazzarini  ( 1976)  998  (c. 458);  Thuc. 4.97.1), denoting  either  the  town  (Heracl.  Cret. 8,  GGM i.101)  or  the polity  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.49)  or  the  territory  (Thuc. 1.108.1).  The city-ethnic  is  (LSAG 93  and 95  no. 12  (C 6);  SEG 92.32  (C 4s);  Dem. 25.60)  but  in  Boiotian  inscriptions  from C 4  onwards  mostly  (IG vii  3055.25  (C 4m), 2723.2\u00ad3  (C 3e)),  attested  already  in  C 5f(SEG  29  1788.7;for the  date,  see  Vott\u00e9ro  ( 2001)  183),  and  sometimes  (IG vii  522.10  (C 3s)).  Roller  ( 1989a)  does  not record  the  city-ethnic. Tanagra  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  (Aristophanes Boeotus  (FGrHist 379)  fr. 2  bis P  Oxy. 2463.26;  cf.  Heracl. Cret. 8\u00ad10,  GGM i.101  (C 3s))  and  in  the  territorial  sense (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.49),and  is  listed  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense (Thuc. 4.91.1,  93.4;  Hell.  Oxy. 19.2\u00ad3). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  a  stamped  tile  of  C 5f(SEG  29  1788.7: \u00b5 ) and in abbreviated form on coins (infra),  and externally  on  a  late  C 6  shield  at  Olympia  commemorating  a victory  over  an  unknown  enemy  (LSAG 93  and 95  no. 12). For  the  individual  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic,  see  e.g. [] \u00b5 [],  naopoios  at  Delphi in 335  (CID ii  76.ii.19\u00ad20). The  territory is  called  (Thuc. 3.91.3\u00ad4)  or  (Thuc. 4.76.4)  or  (later)   (Strabo  9.2.11).  During  the  First  Federation  the  territory  of Tanagra  constituted  one  of  the  eleven  Boiotian  districts (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3);  it  comprised  Delion  (Thuc. 4.76.4),  Aulis (Nicocrates  (FGrHist 376)  fr. 1;Strabo 9.2.8),  Salganeus (Nicocrates  (FGrHist 376)  fr. 1),and  what  was  later  called  the Tetrakomia,  i.e.  Heleon,  Harma,  Mykalessos  (no. 212)  and Pharai  (no. 215)  (Strabo  9.2.14;  Fossey  ( 1988)  43\u00ad99  and 222\u00ad23).  Tanagra  was  bordered  on  the  east  by  Oropos  (no. 214)  (Heracl.  Cret. 7\u00ad8,  GGM i.101),  on  the  west  by  Skolos (no. 219),  belonging  to  Thebes  (Hdt. 9.15.2,  5.79.2;Xen.  Hell. 5.4.49)  and  on  the  north  by  Anthedon  (no. 200)  (Nicocrates (FGrHist 376)  fr. 1)  and  Glisas  (Hdt. 9.43.2),  belonging  to Thebes  (Strabo  9.2.31).  Inclusive of  the  small  dependent poleis,  its  size  has  been  assessed  at  c. 530  km \u00b2  (Fossey  ( 1988) 28). Tanagra  was  allied  with  Thebes  in  506  and  earlier  (Hdt. 5.79.2).  The  city  was  a  member  of  the  First  Federation  (Hell. Oxy. 19.3),  during  which  the  principal  body  of  government was  a  boule,  to  which  only  propertied  citizens  were  admitted (Hell.  Oxy. 19.2,  3).  It  was  a  member  of  the  Second Federation  (Isoc. 14.9),  providing  one  Boiotarch (SEG 25 553  32  476.14  (C 4f);  for  the  date,  see  SEG 45  431  and  Vott\u00e9ro ( 2001)  71),  and  of  the  Third  Federation  (IG vii  2724.7 (c. 280\u00ad270)).  Tanagran  citizens  were  appointed  proxenoi  by Delphi  (no. 177;  SGDI 2674  (c. 328))  and  Eretria  (no. 370)  (IG xii.9203  (C 4s)).  The  Aristotelian  collection  of  politeiai seems  to have included  a  Constitution  of  Tanagra  (Plut.  Mor. 299C;  Hansen  ( 1995a)  53),  which  reported  a  tradition  that the  territory  of  Tanagra  had  once  been  inhabited   \u00b5  (Moggi,  Sin. 82\u00ad84).  During  the  crisis  of 330\u00ad326, Tanagra  received  10,000  medimnoi  of  grain  from  Kyrene (no. 1028)  (RO  96.32). The  protecting  god  of  Tanagra  seems  to  have  been Hermes,  with  the  epithets  Kriophoros  and  Promachos,  each with  his  own  temple--that of  Promachos  near  the  theatre (Paus. 9.22.1\u00ad2  (rC 5m);  LSAG 92  and 94  no. 7  (C 7l\u00adC6e); Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  ii. 44\u00ad50;  iii. 50).  Other  major  divinities attested  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  are  Artemis Eileithyia  (IG vii  546  (C 5),  458  (C 4\u00adC3);  Paus. 9.22.1; Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 193),  Athena  Longatis  (SEG 31  497 (C 4l\u00adC3e)),  Demeter  Gephyraia  (Hdt. 5.57\u00ad61;  REG 12 ( 1899)  53\u00ad115;  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 162\u00ad63);  Dionysos  (IG vii  550  (C 5);  Paus. 9.20.4  (rC 5);  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 183\u00ad85),  Herakles  (SEG 34  367:  kantharoi  inscribed   and `  (C 6s);  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  ii. 12; Andriomenou  ( 1985)  113). According  to  Thuc. 1.108.2\u00ad3,  Tanagra  was  a  walled  city  in 457,  but  following  the  battle  of  Oinophyta  the  Tanagrans had  their  walls  demolished  by  the  Athenians  (cf.  Diod. 11.82.5).  The  existing  circuit  of 2.2  km  with  forty-three  tow- ers  was  of  mudbrick  on  a  mostly  isodomic  ashlar  sockle;  it can  be  dated  to  the  period  c. 425\u00ad375  and  may  have  been erected  after  the  King's  Peace  in  386  (Roller  ( 1974),  ( 1987)). Xenophon's mention  at  Hell. 5.4.49  of  ,however, must  refer  to  the  Theban  stockade  and  not  to  the  walls  of Tanagra  (Munn  ( 1987)  124\u00ad26).  The  city  walls  enclose  an area  of 30  ha  (Roller  ( 1987)  223).  Except,  perhaps,  for  a  tem- ple  of  Hermes  Promachos  near  the  theatre  (Paus. 9.22.2),  all architectural  remains  seem  to  be  later  than  the  C 4  circuit; and  the  orthogonal  town plan,  with  insulae  of 52 102  m, was  clearly  devised  to  fit the e xisting  walls.  Nothing  of Archaic  and  C 5  Tanagra  is  visible  today  (Roller  ( 1989b)  157); but  a  surface  survey  of  the  town  has  been  carried  out  by  a team  from  Leiden,  and  a  geo-prospection  team  has  recon- structed  the  C 4  street  and  insula  plan  across  the  city (Teiresias 32  ( 2002)  1).  A  depression  in  the  ground  is  all  that is  left  of  a  theatre  seen  by  early  travellers.  It  seems  to  be  an integral  part  of  the  urban  plan  of  C 4f(Roller ( 1989b) 152\u00ad54).  Herakleides  describes  Tanagra  as  a  town  inhabited boiotia  453 by farmers  ( 9,  GGM i.101,  9).  Outside  the  city  walls  a  ceme- tery  has  been  excavated  with  some  500  graves,  the  majority from  C 6l  and  C 5s  (Andriomenou  ( 1985)). Tanagra  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard from  c. 500  to 446,  and  from  before  410  to 374  (or  later) (Hansen  ( 1995a)  20\u00ad21),  and  bronze  coins  from  c. 338  to 315.

The  city-ethnic  is  (Hell. Oxy. 19.3;CID  ii  102.i.11  ( 324/3))  or,  once, (IGxii.5 542.25  (C 4m)),  but  in  some  Boiotian  inscriptions  it  is (IG vii  3068.1  Michel 635  (C 3)). Lebadeia  is  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  at  Hell.  Oxy 19.3  and  in  a  sacred  law  of  C 4m  (IG vii  3055).  The  formula [   ][][  ] [] is restored in IG  vii 3086  of  c. 400,  but  see  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  iii. 76  n. 1. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  a  sacred  law  (IG vii  3055  (C 4s);  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  iii. 86\u00ad88)  and  externally  in  Hell.  Oxy. 19.3.

Mem. 3.5.4;  Theophr.  Hist.  pl. 4.11.8)  or  (Arist. Hist.  an. 606a1).  Together  with  Koroneia  (no. 210)  and Haliartos  (no. 206),  Lebadeia  constituted  one  of  the  eleven Boiotian  districts  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3).  A  horos  of  C 4\u00adC3  found some 4  km  south-east  of  Lebadeia  marks  the  border between  Lebadeia  and  Koroneia  (SEG 23  297).  To  the  north- east  Lebadeia  bordered  on  the  territory of  Orchomenos  (no. 213)  (Arist.  Hist.  an. 606a1,  a  passage  which  shows  that  Lake Kopais  in  C 4  was  considerably  smaller  than  indicated  in Barr.;  cf.  also  Lauffer  ( 1986)  136).  The  adjoining  city  to  the north  was  Chaironeia  (no. 201)  (Plut.  Mor. 849A  (rC 4)).The size  of  the  territory  has  been  assessed  at  c. 95  km \u00b2  (Fossey ( 1988)  322,  342). Lebadeia  was  a  member  of  the  First  Federation  (Hell. Oxy. 19.3),  and  the  principal  body  of  government  was  a boule,  to  which  only  propertied  citizens  were  admitted  (Hell. Oxy. 19.2,  3).  The  city  was  sacked  by  Lysandros  in  395  (Plut. Lys. 28.2).  The  city  must  have  been  a  member  of  the  Second Federation  as  well,  since  the  panegyris  celebrating  the Boiotian  victory  at  Leuktra  took  place  in  Lebadeia  (infra), and  the  attestation  of  a  hieromnemon  in 324/3  testifies t o membership  of  the  Third  Federation  (CID ii  102.i.11). Theorodokoi  were  appointed  c. 400  to  host  theoroi  from Delphi  (no. 177)  (Syll. \u00b390.14\u00ad15),  and  in  359  to  host  theoroi from  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (restored  in  IG iv\u00b2.194.a.9). Lebadeia  was  famous  for  its  oracle  of  Trophonios,  with his  brother  Agamedes  the  mythical  architect  of  Apollo's temple  at  Delphi  (Hymn.  Hom.  Ap. 296).In  his  subterranean cave just  outside  Lebadeia,  Trophonios  was  consulted boiotia  445 allegedly  by  Kroisos  of  Lydia  (Hdt. 1.46.2)  and  Mys  of  Persia (Hdt. 8.134.1),  and  certainly  in  C 4m  by  King  Amyntas  of Macedon (IG vii  3055.7\u00ad8).  The  cult  is  attested  from  C 6  to the  end  of  Antiquity  (IG vii  3055:  a  sacred  law  of  C 4m  regu- lating  the  consultations;  Eur.  Ion 300\u00ad2,  404\u00ad9;  Paus. 9.39.2\u00ad14;  Schachter  ( 1991\u00ad94)  iii. 66\u00ad89). The  protecting  god  of  Lebadeia  was  probably  Zeus Basileus  and,  allegedly  following  an  oracle  of  Trophonios given  before  the  battle  of  Leuktra  in  371,  a  pan-Boiotian  fes- tival  was  set  up  at  Lebadeia  in  honour  of  Zeus  Basileus (Diod. 15.53.4).  The  festival  was  held  under  Theban  spon- sorship  to  celebrate  their  victory  and  included  gymnic  and hippic  competitions  (IG vii  552,  2532;  SEG 23  332  (all  C 4m); Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  iii. 109\u00ad18). The  city  of  Lebadeia  was  situated  on  the  eastern  bank  of the  river  Herkyna  (Paus. 9.39.2)  beneath  the  modern  city. The  size  of  the  city  is  still  unknown  (Bintliff  ( 1997a)  231), and  so  far  no  traces  of  an  ancient  defence  circuit  have  been found.  Excavations  have revealed  some  remains  of  C 4  mon- umental  buildings  including  a  stoa  and  a  temple  of  the Megale  Meter  (Fossey  ( 1988)  345;  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  ii. 127\u00ad30;Turner  ( 1994)).To  the  west  of  the  river  Herkyna  were the  famous  oracle  of  Trophonios  and  the  sanctuary  of  Zeus Basileios  with  a  Doric  temple,  of  which  there  are  still  some remains,  presumably  dating  from  C 3  (Fossey  ( 1988)  345; Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  iv. 112\u00ad13). Lebadeia  struck  silver  diobols  on  the  Aiginetan  standard from  c. 386  (or  earlier)  to  374  (or  later)  and  bronze  coins from  c. 338  to 315.(1)  Silver:  obv.

The  change  of  name  may  perhaps  be  connected  with  the refoundation  of  the  town in  c. 400  after  the  synoecism  with Thebes  (no. 221)  in  c. 431.  We  know  that  Eteonos/Skaphlai  was located  near  Skolos  (no. 219)  and  occupied  a  hill  (Hom.  Il. 2.497)  in  the  Parasopia  (Strabo  9.2.24),  but  the  precise  loca- tion  is  unknown  (Fossey  ( 1988)  130\u00ad31). Apart  from  Steph.  Byz.  ( 283.8),  Eteonos/Skaphai  is  never called  a  polis,  and  the  reasons  for  including  the  site  in  this inventory  are  (a)  that  a  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  Classical sources  (Hansen  ( 1995a)  28,  48)  and  (b)  that  a  sympoliteia with  Plataiai  in  C 5m  suggests  that  Eteonos/Skaphlai  had been  a  polis  before  it  joined  the  sympoliteia  and  may  perhaps still  have  been  a  dependent  polis  even  after  the  union  (Hell. Oxy. 19.3;  Hansen  ( 1995a)  16).  Skaphai  was  one  of  the  small unwalled  settlements  whose  population  was  moved  to Thebes  (Hell.  Oxy. 20.3)  in  connection  with  the  major  syn- oecism  at  the  outbreak  of  the  Peloponnesian  War  (Demand ( 1990)  83\u00ad85;  Moggi.  Sin. 197\u00ad204  prefers  a  date  c. 426\u00ad424). Apart  from  Steph.  Byz. 283.10,  there  is  no  attestation  of  a city-ethnic  derived  from  the  toponym  Eteonos,  but  the  city- ethnic ()  is  attested  in  three  Attic  sepulchral inscriptions  of  C 4:  IG ii\u00b2  11202: (C 4f);  SEG 15  161: , (C 4m,  Eleusis);  SEG 22  191: (C 4s,  Eleusis);  cf.  also  SEG 22  192  (second  and third  centuries  ad).

The full  form  of  the  city-ethnic  is  unknown  since  it  is  attested only  in  the  abbreviated  form  on  the  reverse  of  some coins  of  C 4e  (infra).  The  identification of  Pharai  with  mod- ern  Ag.  Pandeleimon  is  uncertain  (Fossey  ( 1988)  96;  Barr.). Pharai  is  not  called  a  polis  in  any  extant  source,  but  the existence  of  a  C 4  mint  strongly  suggests  that  it  must  have been  a  polis,  at  least  in  the  period  after  the  King's  Peace  of 386. According  to  Strabo  ( 9.2.14\u00ad15),  Pharai,  Heleon,  Harma and  Mykalessos  (no. 212)  formed  a  \u00b5  which  lay in  the  territory  of  Tanagra  (no. 220).

The  name  of  the  territory  is  unknown;  its  size has  been  assessed  at  c. 55  km \u00b2  (Fossey  ( 1988)  292). During  the  First  Federation,  Orchomenos  and  Hyettos constituted  two  of  the  Boiotian  districts  and  provided  two Boiotarchs  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3).  The  difference  in  size  between the  two  cities  indicates  that,  like  the  other  small  poleis around  Lake  Kopais,  Hyettos  provided  one  Boiotarch  every third  year  and  Orchomenos  all  the  others  (Etienne  and Knoepfler ( 1976)  229\u00ad33).  The  principal  body  of  govern- ment  was  a  boule  to  which  only  propertied  citizens  were admitted  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.2,  3).  Hyettos  was  a  member  of  the Third  Federation  (IG vii  1673.4  (c. 240)).  There  is  no  evi- dence  concerning  the  Second  Federation. The  acropolis  was  fortified b y  a  wall  of  Lesbian  masonry dating  from  c. 500  with  repairs  of  C 4  and  C 2.  The  circuit encloses  an  area  of  c. 6  ha.  There  are  no  traces  of  any  wall around  the  lower  city,  which  seems  to  have  lain  south  and east  of  the  acropolis  (Etienne  and  Knoepfler ( 1976)  45\u00ad65).A surface  survey  of  the  urban  centre  shows  that  it  covered  c. 26 ha  (Bintliff  ( 1999)  15).  There  are  no  traces  of  habitation antedating  the  Archaic  period  (Fossey  ( 1988)  294\u00ad95). Hyettos  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard from  c. 500  to c. 480.

Oxy. 20.3;  Demand  ( 1990) 83\u00ad85;  Moggi,  Sin. 197\u00ad204).  By  395,  however,  Erythrai  had been  repopulated,  but  was  still  lying  within  the  territory  of Thebes  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3). The  acropolis  was  fortified b y  an  undated  defence  circuit of  rubble  with  no  pretence  to style  enclosing  an  area  of 1,600 m \u00b2  (Fossey  ( 1988)  117\u00ad18).  A  wall  of  the  lower  town  \"is  only visible  as  a  line  in  the  fall  of  the  land\"(letter  from  Fossey,  Jan. 1995).  The  walls  are  probably  later  than  431,  when  Erythrai  is described  as  unfortified ( Hell.  Oxy. 20.3).  Apart  from  a  few LH iii  sherds,  the  settlement  cannot  be  traced  further  back than  the  Classical  period  (Fossey  ( 1988)  118). 204.

Again,  [ ][~] has been restored  on  a  C 6l  helmet  dedicated  to  Olympian  Zeus  (SEG 42  381),  and  the  oldest  coins  ( 500\u00ad480)  are  marked  with  a  , whereas  the  coins  of  the  next  series  (from  c. 456\u00ad446)  have the  legend  (Head,  HN \u00b2345). Koroneia  is  perhaps  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by Hecat.  fr. 117  (  Steph.  Byz. 377.12,  where  Hekataios  is  quot- ed  for  the  toponym  but  not  necessarily  for  the  site- classification).  Koroneia  is  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense in  Thucydides'  description  of  the  battle  of  Delion  ( 4.91.1, 93.4)  and  in  the  Oxyrhynchus  historian's  description  of  the Boiotian  constitution  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  abbreviated  form  on  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  a  C 6 dedication  in  Thebes  (Lazzarini  ( 1976)  916)  as  well  as  in  literary  sources  (Hdt. 5.79.2;  Thuc. 4.93.4).  The  individual use  is  attested  internally  in  a  list  of  victors  at  the  Pamboiotia (SEG 26  551  (C 3s))  and  externally  in  a  sepulchral  inscription from  Thespiai:    (IG vii 2114  Choix 49  (Hellenistic)). The  territory was  called  (Thuc. 1.113.2;  Arist. Mir.  ausc. 842b3)  or  (Strabo  9.2.19,  28).  The territory  comprised  Hermaion  (a  valley),  Metachoion  (a fortress  between  Koroneia  and  Orchomenos  (no. 213), Ephor.  fr. 94a),  the  sanctuary  of  Athena  Itonia  (Strabo 9.2.29;  schol.  Ap.  Rhod. 1.551a)  and  Alalkomenai  (no. 199) (Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 113).  Its  size  has  been  assessed  at  c. 95 km \u00b2  (Fossey  ( 1988)  322).  Together  with  Haliartos  (no. 206) and  Lebadeia  (no. 211),  Koroneia  constituted  one  of  the eleven  Boiotian  districts  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3).  The  principal body  of  government  was  a  boule,  to  which  only  propertied citizens  were  admitted  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.2,  3). Koroneia  was  allied  with  Thebes  in  506  and  earlier  (Hdt. 5.79.2).  The  city  was  a  member  of  the  First  Federation  (Hell. Oxy. 19.3\u00ad4),  the  Second  Federation  (Diod. 16.35.3)  and  the Third  Federation  (CID ii  74.50).  A  citizen  of  Koroneia  was appointed  proxenos  by  Delphi  (no. 177)  (F.Delphes iii.3102 (C 4l)).  In  359  a  theorodokos  was  appointed  to  host  theoroi from  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.194.a.7). The  protecting  god  of  Koroneia  was  Athena  Itonia,  whose sanctuary  seems  to  have  been  located  just  to  the  north  of  the acropolis  (Alc.  fr. 325;Bacchyl.  fr. 15;  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 444 hansen 117\u00ad27),  where  excavations  have  uncovered  the  foundations of  three  buildings  that  can  be  traced  back  to  C 6  (Fossey ( 1988)  326).  The  cult  is  attested  on  a  C 6  lekane  (Brit.  Mus. B 80)  depicting  Athena,  her  priestess  and  a  serpentine  con- sort,  later  identified w ith  the  chthonic  Zeus.  Her  festival included  hippic  competitions  (Pind.  Parth. 2.46\u00ad49).  The pan-Boiotian  festival  postdates  the  Classical  period. Another  important  deity  at  Koroneia  was  Herakles  Charops (Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  ii. 3\u00ad10),  whose  sanctuary  was  close  to and  possibly  shared  with  Zeus  Laphystios  (SEG 23  297.6\u00ad7; Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  iii. 104\u00ad6).  In  inscriptions  of  C 4\u00adC3  is attested  a  cult  of  Demeter  Thesmophoros  (IG vii  2876; Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 155). In 353/2  Koroneia  was  conquered  by  Onomarchos (Ephor.  fr. 94a;  Diod. 16.35.3)  and  became  a  Phokian  strong- hold  (Dem. 19.148;Diod.  16.58.1)  until  346,  when  Philip  had the  city  handed  over  to  the  Thebans  (Dem. 5.22,  6.13),  who exposed  it  to  an  andrapodismos  (Dem. 19.112,325);  but  short- ly  afterwards  Koroneia  must  have  been  resettled,  since  in 337/6  one  of  the  Boiotian  tamiai  in  Delphi  was  a  Koroneian citizen  (CID ii  74.50). Koroneia  was  a  walled  city  when  conquered  by  the Phokians  in  353  (Ephor.  fr. 94a;  Diod. 16.58.1).  There  are remains  of  an  undated  polygonal  circuit  around  the  acrop- olis,  enclosing  an  area  of 38  ha  (Fossey  ( 1988)  325\u00ad26,letter of Jan. 1995);  another  circuit  of  unknown  date  enclosing  the lower  town  could  still  be  seen  in  the  nineteenth  century (Frazer  ( 1898)  v. 70).The  settlement  is  supposed  to  have  cov- ered  c. 94  ha  (Bintliff  ( 1997a)  244);  it  can  be  traced  back  to  the Neolithic  period,  and  there  are  remains  of  the  Geometric, Archaic  and  Classical  periods  (Fossey  ( 1988)  326).The  site  of a  possible  theatre  and  above  it  remains  of  a  Doric  temple were  noted  by  early  travellers  (Fossey  ( 1988)  325). Koroneia  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard c. 500\u00ad480,  c. 456\u00ad446  and  in  C 5l\u00adC4f,  and  bronze  coins c. 338\u00ad315.(1)  Silver,  c. 500\u00ad480,denominations:  drachm,  obol, hemiobol,  tetartemorion;  obv.

Bacch. 751),  denoting  the  polity  (Hdt. 6.108.6)  or  the  town (Hdt. 9.15.3)  or  the  territory  (Thuc. 3.24.2).There  is  no  attes- tation  of  the  toponym  in  epigraphical  sources,  and  the  only attestation  of  a  city-ethnic  is  in  Steph.  Byz. 653.9. Apart  from  Pausanias'  description  of  Hysiai  as  the  ruins of  what  had  once  been  a  Boiotian  polis  ( 9.2.1),the  only  refer- ence  in  ancient  literature  to  Hysiai  as  a  polis  is  in  Harp. 15: `  ,   ,  quoting  Hypereides'  speech For  Xenophilos  (fr. 156,  Sauppe)  for  the  toponym  and Euripides'  Antiope  (fr. 180,  Nauck)  for  the  site-classification, which,  however,  is  applied  to  the  Heroic  Age  and  cannot  be used  as  evidence  for  the  status  of  Hysiai  in  the  Archaic  and Classical  periods.  The  two  main  reasons  for  including  Hysiai in  this  inventory  are  (a)  that  it  had  a  territory  of  its  own  and (b)  that  it  was  placed  right  between  Plataiai  (no. 216)  and  the three  small  cities  which  are  named  by  the  Oxyrhynchus  his- torian  as  \u00b5\u00b5  with  Plataiai  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3): viz.  Erythrai  (no. 203),Skolos  (no. 219)  and  Eteonos/Skaphai (no. 204).  This  location  strongly  indicates  that  Hysiai  must have  been  one  of  the  small  members  of  the  sympoliteia  not mentioned  explicitly  by the  Oxyrhynchus  historian  but referred  to in  the  phrase      ,  and  thus Hysiai  was  presumably  a  polis,  perhaps  a  dependent  polis after  it  joined  the  sympoliteia. Hysiai  had  been  annexed  by  Athens,  probably  in  519,  and was  still  part  of  Attika  in  506  (Hdt. 5.74.2,6.108.6);  but  in  479 Hysiai  was  lying  in  Plataian  territory  (Hdt. 9.101.1),yet  at  the same  time  had  a  territory  of  its  own  which,  however,  must have  been  very  small  (Hdt. 9.25.3,  cf. 6.108.6)  bordering  on Plataiai  to  the  west  (Hdt. 9.15.3,  25.3),  Thebes  to  the  north (Hdt. 6.108.6),  Erythrai  to  the  east  (Hdt. 9.15.3)  and Eleutherai  to the  south  (Paus. 9.1.6).  Later  in  C 5  Hysiai seems  to  have  been  a  member  of  the  sympoliteia  led  by Plataiai  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3)  and  must  accordingly  have  been  a part  of  Platai\u00efs  (cf.  Paus. 9.2.1). A  cult  of  Demeter  is  attested  in  inscriptions  (IG vii 1670\u00ad71  (both  C 5e))  and  in  the  sources  for  the  battle  of Plataiai,  in  which  the  sanctuary  is  described  as  that  of Demeter  Eleusinia  (Hdt. 9.57.2,  62.2,  65.2,  69.1;Plut.  Arist. 11.6;  Paus. 9.4.3;  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 152\u00ad54).  Pritchett ( 1979)  associated  the  sanctuary  with  some  remains  of  C 5e found  in  the  plain  near  modern  Pantanassa,  but  a  location on  the  hills  just  north  of  modern  Kriekouki  was  suggested by Wallace  ( 1985)  97\u00ad99.  Of  the  settlement  itself,  remains  of a  circuit  wall  (undated)  could  still  be  seen  at  Kriekouki  in the  early  twentieth  century  (Fossey  ( 1988)  113),  and  there  are pottery  and  small  finds of  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods (ibid. 114). 209.

Apart from  Steph.  Byz. 580.8,  there  is  no  attestation  of  an  ethnic. The  only  classification of  Skolos  as  a  polis  is  in  Steph.  Byz. 580.7.

Oxy. 19.3;  Hansen  ( 1995a)  16). We  have  no  information  about  the  name  of  the  territory, which  must  have been  very small.  Down to 479  Skolos  was  in Theban  territory  (Hdt. 9.15.2,  65.1)  and  probably  situated north  of  the  river  Asopos,  which  was  the  southern  border  of the  territory  of  Thebes  (Hdt. 6.108.6;  cf.  most  recently  Munn ( 1987)  121\u00ad24).After  the  Persian  Wars  Skolos  became  part  of Plataian  territory  and  a  member  of  the  sympoliteia  which  for some  time  constituted  two  of  the  eleven  Boiotian  districts (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3).  But  by  431  Skolos  must  have  been  annexed by  Thebes  once  again,  since  it  was  one  of  the  small  unwalled settlements  whose  population  was  moved  to  Thebes  (Hell. Oxy. 20.3)  in  connection  with  the  major  synoecism  at  the outbreak  of  the  Peloponnesian  War  (Demand  ( 1990)  82\u00ad85; Moggi,  Sin. 197\u00ad204).By  395  Skolos  had  been  repopulated.  It still  belonged  to Thebes  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3),  but  since  both Strabo  9.2.23  and,  more  importantly,  Paus. 9.4.4  (cf.  Wallace ( 1979)  89)  place  Skolos  south  of  the  river  Asopos,  the refounded  village  was  probably  located  south  of  the  Asopos in  land  that  had  been  Theban  territory  since  the  destruction of  Plataiai  in  426. 452 hansen 220.

The  toponym  denotes  either  the  town  (IG iv\u00b2.194.a.8)  or  the  polity  (Dem. 19.325)  or  the  territory (Thuc. 1.113.2).  The  city-ethnic  is  '\u00b5  (Hdt. 9.16.1; CID ii  74.i.36),  but  in  Boiotian  inscriptions  almost  always '\u00b5  (LSAG 93  and 95  no. 11  (C 6m))  and  only  occa- sionally '\u00b5  (both  forms  are  attested  in  IG vii 3172.17,  51\u00ad52  ( 223)). Orchomenos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  (Dem. 16.25  and  implicitly  in  Ps.-Skylax  59),  in  the  political  sense (Thuc. 4.91.1,  93.4;  Hell.  Oxy. 19.2\u00ad3)  and  in  the  territorial sense  (Pind.  fr. 333.a.8,  Maehler). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  an  abbreviated  form  on  coins  (infra)  and  externally  on  a 446 hansen C 6m  helmet  at  Olympia  commemorating  a  victory  over Koroneia  (no. 210)  (LSAG 93  and 95  no. 11).  For  the  individ- ual  and  external  use,  see   `\u00b5 '\u00b5 (IG ii\u00b2  10036  ( 410\u00ad390)).  See  also  in  the  C 5  dedication  from Delphi:  [ ']  ...

(When  denoting  the  city,  the gender  of  the  toponym  is  invariably  masculine--the e xcep- tion  is  Apol.  Rhod.  Arg. 4.257--thus  '\u00b5 proba- bly  denotes  the  territory of  Orchomenos  with  either  or implied.) To  the  north,  Orchomenos  bordered  on  Phokis  and included  Aspledon  (Paus. 9.38.9),  Kyrtone  and  Korseia (Paus. 9.39.1;  cf.  Etienne  and  Knoepfler ( 1976)  196)  and Tegyra (Plut.  Pelop. 16.1\u00ad3).  To  the  south  Orchomenos  bor- dered  on  the  territory of  Lebadeia  (no. 211)  (Arist.  Hist.  an. 605b31;  Paus. 9.39.1).  Down to c. 400  the  territory of Orchomenos  seems  to have included  Chaironeia  (no. 201) (Hdt. 8.34.1;  Thuc. 4.76.3;  Theopomp.  fr. 407),  and  after  457 Chaironeia  and  Orchomenos  served  as  a  refuge  for  oligarchs from  the  other  Boiotian  poleis  (Hellan.  fr. 81).  But Chaironeia  became  free  of  Orchomenos  at  some  time  after 424  (Thuc. 4.76.3,  93.4)  but  before  395  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3).  The size  of  the  territory  has  been  assessed  at  c. 105  km \u00b2  (Fossey ( 1988)  342);  including  Kyrtone  and  Korseia  it  was  c. 150  km. Together  with  Hyettos  (no. 207),  Orchomenos  constituted two  of  the  eleven  Boiotian  districts  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3). In  the  Catalogue  of  Ships  Orchomenos  is  called   and  is  not  a  part  of  Boiotia  (Hom.  Il. 2.511;  cf.  Thuc. 4.76.3). According  to  this  tradition,  Orchomenos  and  the  Minyans had  once  ruled  Boiotia  and  received  tribute  from  the Boiotian  cities  (Isoc. 14.10;Diod.15.79.5).On  the  Bronze  Age palace  and  Mycenaean  remains  in  Orchomenos,  see  Hiller ( 1989). Orchomenos  was  a  member  of  the  First  Federation,  and, together  with  Hyettos,  supplied  two  of  the  eleven  Boiotarchs (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3);  but  in  395  at  the  outbreak  of  the  Corinthian War  the  Orchomenians  joined  Sparta  and  defected  from  the Federation  (Xen.  Hell. 3.5.6).  The  city  was  garrisoned  by  the Spartans  from  395  to 375  or  even  later  (Xen.  Hell. 4.3.15, 5.1.29;Diod.  15.37.1),  and  the  war  between  Thebes  and Orchomenos  went  on  until  371  (Xen.  Hell. 6.4.10).  In  370, however,  Orchomenos  was  forced  to  rejoin  the  Boiotian Federation  (Diod. 15.57.1),apparently  without  any  represen- tation  in  the  federal  government  (only  seven  Boiotarchs  in 365:  SEG 34  355).  An  abortive  coup  d'\u00e9tat  planned  by  the Orchomenian  knights  in  collusion  with  some  Theban  exiles resulted  in  a  Theban  attack  on  Orchomenos  in  364.  The  city was  conquered,  destroyed  and  exposed  to  an  andrapodismos by  which  all  men  were  killed  while  women  and  children were  sold  into  slavery  (Diod. 15.79.3\u00ad6;Dem.  16.4,  16.25, 20.109).  But  the  site  was  not  abandoned:  and  in  359  an Orchomenian  theorodokos  was  appointed  to  host  a  theoros from  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.194.a.8).  So  in  364 Orchomenos  must  have  been  given  to  settlers  who  were loyal  to Thebes.  In 354  Orchomenos  was  conquered  by Onomarchos  (Diod. 16.33.4;  Buckler  ( 1989)  56)  and  occu- pied  by  the  Phokians  until  their  capitulation  in  the  summer of 346  (Dem. 19.148;  Aeschin. 2.141;Diod.  16.58.1).  During the  Phokian  occupation  the  city  was  resettled  by  some Orchomenians,  probably  those  who  had  escaped  the andrapodismos  of 364  (Aeschin. 2.141;Dem.  16.25;  schol. Dem. 6.13,  21,  Dilts).  After  the  peace  with  the  Phokians, Philip  surrendered  Orchomenos  to  the  Thebans  (Dem. 5.21\u00ad22),  and  the  city  seems  to  have  suffered  yet  another andrapodismos  (Dem. 19.112,  141,  325).  When  the  Thebans had  been  defeated  at  Chaironeia,  however,  Orchomenos  was refounded,  this  time  with  Philip's  support,  and  the  city  was given  back  to  the  surviving  Orchomenians  (Paus. 4.27.10, 9.37.8);  it  joined  the  Federation  again,  and  in  337/6  one  of  the Boiotian  hieromnemones  at  Delphi  was  an  Orchomenian (CID ii  74.i.36,  ii.27).  After  the  destruction  of  Thebes  in  335, Orchomenos  became  once  again  a  walled  city  (Arr.  Anab. 1.9.10). Orchomenos  was  a  member  of the  Kalaurian Amphiktyony  (Strabo  8.6.14;  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  ii. 213\u00ad14; Tausend  ( 1992)  12\u00ad13).  In  452  Orchomenos  may  have  been  a member  of  the  Delian  League  (IG i\u00b3  260.ix.9,  as  restored  by D.  Lewis;  see  CAH  v. 50). The  constitution  of  Orchomenos  was  oligarchic  (Thuc. 4.76.3;Diod.15.79.3),and  we  hear  about  some  Orchomenian exiles  who  in  424  planned  to  set  up  democracies  in  Siphai (no. 218)  and  Chaironeia  (Thuc. 4.76.3;  cf.  Hansen  ( 1995a) 22).  The  principal  body  of  government  was  a  boule,  to  which only  propertied  citizens  were  admitted  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.2,  3). The  Aristotelian  collection  of  politeiai  included  a Constitution  of  the  Orchomenians  (Arist.  frr. 578\u00ad82). Pausanias'  reference  at  9.34.10  to  two  Orchomenian  phylai,if trustworthy,  must  refer  to his  own  day  (Jones,  POAG 78\u00ad79). Orchomenian  citizens  were  appointed  proxenoi  by  Delphi (no. 177)  (F.Delphes iii.4394  (C 4s,  but  heavily  restored)). The  protecting  god  of  Orchomenos  was  Zeus  with  vari- ous  epithets,  of  which  Karaios  (SEG 32  478  (C 4f))  and  Soter (Tod 197  ( 330/29))  are  attested  in  Classical  sources boiotia  447 (Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  iii. 120\u00ad24).  Other  major  divinities attested  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  are  (a)  the Charites  (Pind.  Ol. 14.3\u00ad4;Ephor.  fr. 152),  whose  sanctuary according  to  Paus. 9.38.1  was  the  oldest  in  Orchomenos (Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 140\u00ad41);(b)  Dionysos,  whose  sanctu- ary  housed  a  cult  image  by  Myron  (Paus. 9.30.1  (rC 5m)); musical  contests  are  attested  c. 400  (Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 180  n. 2),  and  a  biennial  rite  in  which  the  priest  of  Dionysos pursued  women  in  ritual  flight (and if  he  caught  one  might kill  her)  must  antedate  the  Classical  period  (Plut.  Mor. 299F; Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 179\u00ad81).  An  extra-urban  sanctuary  of the  Classical  period  c. 3.5  km  north  of  Orchomenos  has  been assigned  to  Dionysos  (Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 181).Asopichos of  Orchomenos  is  recorded  as  victor  in  the  Olympic  Games of 488  (Pind.  Ol. 14;  Olympionikai 182). The  only  explicit  reference  in  written  sources  to  walls  is \u00b5  at  Diod. 16.58.1,  which  shows  that Orchomenos  was  fortified during the Phokian occupation, 353\u00ad346.  Substantial  remains  of  a  polygonal  and  irregular trapezoidal  wall  enclose  the  acropolis  and  the  western  part of  the  town;  it  is  crowned  by  a  keep  of  ashlar  masonry.  The existing  walls  enclose  an  area  of  less  than  40  ha,  but  the  lower city  must  have  extended  further  to  the  south,  and  the  settle- ment  may  have  covered  altogether  c. 90  ha  (Bintliff  ( 1997a) 243).  The  date  of  the  wall  is  disputed.  Fossey  ( 1988)  353  sug- gests  the  Archaic  period  for  the  polygonal  masonry  and  the Classical  for  the  ashlar;  Scranton  ( 1941)  prefers  C 4m,where- as  Lauffer  ( 1974)  297\u00ad99  prefers  to identify  the  remains  with the  walls  erected  in  the  330s  after  the  sack  of  Thebes  in  335 (Arr.  Anab. 1.9.10).  For  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  the degree  of  urbanisation  is  virtually  unknown,  partly  because the  Classical  remains  were  destroyed  by  the  later  Byzantine occupation  and  partly  because  the  relevant  material  from Bulle's  excavations  was  never  published  (Lauffer  ( 1974)  311). Remains  have been  found  of  Archaic  temples,  one  of  them possibly  the  shrine  of  the  Charites  or  of  Dionysos  (Fossey ( 1988)  354),  and  a  theatre  of  C 4s  (Spyropoulos  in  AR 20 ( 1973\u00ad74)  20),  apparently  dedicated  to  the  Charites  (BCH 98 ( 1974)  224;  Isler  ( 1994)  268).  The  settlement  can  be  traced back  to  the  Neolithic  period,  and  there  are  remains  of  the Geometric,  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  (Fossey  ( 1988) 353\u00ad59). Orchomenos  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  stan- dard  from  c. 500  to 480  and  from  c. 400  (or  earlier,  supra 432) to 374  (or  later),  and  bronze  coins  c. 338\u00ad315.(1)  Silver, c. 500\u00ad480,  denominations:  obol,  tritartemorion,  hemiobol; obv.  incuse;  rev.  sprouting  corn-grain.

The  toponym  is  ', (Hdt. 6.101.1;Dem.  16.11;  SEG 19  363  (C 4s);  SEG 3  117.14 ( 303/2)),  or,  once, (Steph.  Byz. 601.3)  denoting  either  the town  (Thuc. 8.60.1)  or  the  territory  (Hyp. 3.16).  The  city- ethnic  is  '  (Thuc. 2.23.3;  I.Oropos 1\u00ad2  IG vii 4250\u00ad51  RO 75  A\u00adB  ( 338\u00ad335);  cf.  Rhodes,  DGS 116). All  attestations  of  Oropos  as  a  polis  are  Hellenistic. Oropos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Heracl.  Cret. 7 (GGM i.100  (C 3s))  and  in  the  political  sense  by  Diod. 14.17.3 (rC 4),  and  in  some  citizenship  decrees  of 322\u00ad312  (I.Oropos 4.7\u00ad8,  5.8\u00ad9,  6.9\u00ad10  IG vii  4256\u00ad57  and  SEG 15.264  (all C 4l)). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  two  proxeny  decrees  of  C 4m  (I.Oropos 1\u00ad2)  and  external- ly  in  many  literary  sources  (Thuc. 2.23.3;Isoc.  14.20).  The individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  a sepulchral  inscription  of  C 2  (SEG 15  303)  and  externally  in an  Attic  naval  catalogue  of  C 5l  (IG i\u00b3  1032.170)  and  in  a  list  of aphedriateuontes  of 312\u00ad304:[ ]   \u00b5\u00b5 '  (IG vii  2724a.5  (c. 280\u00ad270)). The  name  of  the  territory  is  '  (Thuc. 4.99.1)  or '  (Hyp. 3.16),  (Steph.  Byz. 711.2)  or  (Steph.  Byz. 601.3).  It  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  being  contiguous  with Boiotia  (SEG 37  100.142  (c. 330))  and  sometimes  as  being  part of  Boiotia  (Paus. 1.34.1).  Thucydides'  account  of  the  after- math  of  the  battle  of  Delion  shows  that  Oropos  was  a  border district  between  Attika  and  Boiotia  (Thuc. 4.99.1).  The  size of  the  territory  has  been  assessed  at  c. 110  km \u00b2  (Fossey  ( 1988) 28).  A  survey  has  been  conducted  in  the  territory (Cosmopoulos  ( 2001)). According  to  the  Boiotian  historian  Nikokrates  (FGrHist 376)  fr. 1,  Oropos  was  originally  a  colony  of  Eretria  (no. 370), and  this  piece  of  information  is  supported  by a  study  of  the local  dialect,  which  was  neither  Boiotian  nor  Attic  but  a form  of  Ionic  very  close  to  that  spoken  by  the  Eretrians (Wilamowitz-M\u00f6llendorff  ( 1886)  97\u00ad103).  Oropos  fell  to Athens  probably  after  507/6  (since  the  settlement  did  not become  an  Attic  deme),  perhaps  before  490  (Hdt. 6.101.1), 448 hansen but  perhaps  only  after  the  Persian  destruction  of  Eretria (Knoepfler ( 1985)  52).

The  toponym  is  ,  (RO  88.34\u00ad35  (C 4m);  IG iv\u00b2.1629  (C 2);  Hdt. 9.25.2),  but some  authors  use  the  singular: ,  (Hom.  Il 2.504; Thuc. 2.2.1  et  alibi).  The  toponym  denotes  either  the  town (Thuc. 2.2.1)  or  the  polity  (Thuc. 2.2.3)  or  the  territory (Xen. Hell. 5.4.48).  The  city-ethnic  is  (ML 27.6  ( 479); SEG 92.44  (C 4s);  IG vii  1664.2\u00ad3  (C 3);  Hdt. 8.44.1;  Thuc. boiotia  449 2.3.1;Lys.  23.2),  and  the  ktetikon is  used  as  an ethnic  only  in  the  feminine  (IG ii\u00b2  10096  (C 4m));  for  one possible  exception,  see  Aeschin. 3.162. Plataiai  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Hdt. 8.50.2;  Thuc. 2.5.4,  3.68.3;Aen.Tact.  2.3)  and  in  the  political sense  (Thuc. 2.2.2,  3.57.2;Isoc.  8.17,  14.1;Dem.16.25,  59.98); cf.  polites  at  Thuc. 2.2.2,  3.65.3.At  RO  88.34  (C 4),  polis  is  used in  the  urban  and  political  senses  simultaneously.  The  term is  used  by  Hdt. 7.233.2. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  abbreviated  form  on  coins  of  C 4e  (infra;  cf.  also  IG vii 1664.2\u00ad3  (C 3))  and  externally  on  the  Serpent  Column  (ML 27.6  ( 479)).  For  the  individual  and  external  use,  see,  e.g. '   in  a  Troizenian  citizen- ship  decree  of 369  (Syll. \u00b3162.2\u00ad3  ( 369)).  Patris  is  used  about the  community  at  Isoc. 14.13. The  name  of  the  territory  is     (Thuc. 2.71.4);    (Thuc. 3.58.5); (Thuc. 4.72.1);     (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.48).  In  506  the river  Asopos  was  made  the  border  between  Plataiai  and Thebes  (Hdt. 6.108.6;  Paus. 9.4.4).  To  the  west  Plataiai  bor- dered  on  Thespiai  (no. 222)  (Hdt  8.50.2)  and  to  the  east  on Hysiai  (no. 208)  (Hdt. 6.108.6),  which  was  then  a  part  of Attika  (Hdt. 5.74.2).  The  size  of  the  territory  has  been assessed  at  c. 170  km \u00b2  (Fossey  ( 1988)  100).  It  is  debated whether  Plataiai  too  was  a  part  of  Attika  from  519  onwards (for:  Badian  ( 1993)  117;  against:  Hammond  ( 1992)  145).  But at  least  from  479  Plataiai  was  a  part  of  Boiotia.  Platai\u00efs  came to  constitute  two  of  the  eleven  Boiotian  districts  and  includ- ed  the  small  towns  in  the  Parasopia  which  by  then  had entered  into  a  sympoliteia  with  Plataiai;  viz.  Skolos  (no. 219), Erythrai  (no. 203),  Eteonos/Skaphai  (no. 204)  and, undoubtedly,  Hysiai  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3).  In  429  King Archidamos  summoned  the  Plataians  to  show  him  the  bor- ders  of  Plataian  territory (Thuc. 2.72.3).  In  427/6  the  territo- ry  was  annexed  by  Thebes  (Thuc. 3.68.2\u00ad3,  5.17.2). Plataiai  is  described  as  a  small  town  (Thuc. 2.77.2),  and according  to  Poseidippos  (fr. 29,C3e)  it  deserved  to  be  called a  polis  only  during  the  celebration  of  the  Eleutheria  (infra). Six  hundred  Plataian  hoplites  fought  at  Plataiai  in  479  (Hdt. 9.28.6).  When  the  Thebans  made  their  nocturnal  attack  on Plataiai  in  431,  the  urban  population  must  have  totalled  at least  some  2,000  persons  (Thuc. 2.3.2;  Hansen  ( 1997)  27\u00ad28), and  there  were  400  to  defend  the  city  when  the  siege  began in 429  (Thuc. 2.78.3). In 519  (Thuc. 3.68.5;  Hornblower  ( 1991)  464\u00ad65)  Plataiai entered  into  an  alliance  with  Athens  (Thuc. 2.73.3,  3.68.5; Hammond  ( 1992)  144)  whereby  the  Plataians  were  granted Athenian  citizenship  collectively  (Thuc. 3.55.3,  63.2;  Amit ( 1973)  75\u00ad78;  Hornblower  ( 1991)  449);  the  grant  probably implied  that  a  Plataian  who  moved  to  Athens  was  inscribed as  a  citizen  without  an  individual  decree  passed  by  the  peo- ple.  The  Plataians  fought  side  by  side  with  the  Athenians  at Marathon  (Hdt. 6.108.1),  and  those  who  died  in  battle  were buried  with  the  Athenian  (manumitted)  slaves  (Paus. 1.32.3; Hammond  ( 1992)  147\u00ad50).  In  480  the  Persians  occupied Plataiai,  and  destroyed  the  city  by  fire (Hdt. 8.50.2). Plataians  fought  in  the  battle  of  Plataiai  in  479  (Hdt. 9.28.6), and  after  the  battle  Pausanias  had  all  the  victors  take  an  oath that  guaranteed  the  independence  of  the  Plataian  polis (Thuc. 2.71.2).  At  some  time  between  the  Persian  and  the Peloponnesian  Wars,  when  the  First  Federation  was  organ- ised  as  described  by  the  Oxyrhynchus  historian,  Plataiai  had some  kind  of  sympoliteia  with  the  small  towns  in  the Parasopia,  controlled  two  of  the  eleven  districts  of  Boiotia, and  provided  two  Boiotarchs  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3;  Kirsten  ( 1950) 2302\u00ad3).  It  is  apparent,  however,  from  Thucydides'  account (Thuc. 2.2.4,  3.65.2;  Buck  ( 1979)  153\u00ad54)  that  Plataiai  had  left the  Federation  when  in  the  spring  of 431  the  city  was attacked  by  the  Thebans  (Thuc. 2.2\u00ad6),  assisted  by  some Plataian  collaborators  (Thuc. 2.2.2\u00ad3)  of  oligarchic  convic- tions  (Thuc. 3.65.2;Gehrke,  Stasis 132). During  this  period  Plataiai  was  a  democracy  in  which major  decisions  were made  by the  people  in  assembly (Thuc. 2.72.2;  see  Amit  ( 1973)  66\u00ad71).  In  the  years  429\u00ad427 Plataiai  was  besieged  by  the  Lakedaimonians  and  the  mem- bers  of  the  Peloponnesian  League  (Thuc. 2.71\u00ad78,  3.20\u00ad24, 3.52\u00ad68).  After  its  capture  in  427,  the  men  were  killed,  while the  women  were  exposed  to  andrapodismos  (Thuc. 3.68.2; Dem. 59.103).  In  426  the  city  was  razed  to  the  ground  (Thuc. 3.68.3)  and  settled  by  some  Megarians  plus  a  few  Plataians who  were  loyal  to Sparta  (Thuc. 3.68.3).Some  Plataian  evac- uees  of 431  (Thuc. 2.6.4)  and  some  who  in  428  escaped  the siege  (Thuc. 3.24.2)  were  all  granted  Athenian  citizenship (Dem. 59.103\u00ad4;Isoc.  12.94;  Osborne  ( 1982)  D  1)  and inscribed  in  the  Attic  tribes  and  demes  (Lys. 23.2\u00ad3).  After the  destruction  of  Skione  (no. 609)  in  421,  the  Athenians gave  the  place  to  the  Plataians  (Thuc. 5.32.1),  but  many remained  in  Athens  (Lys. 23.5\u00ad7).  The  Plataians  were restored  to  their  native  city  only  after  the  King's  Peace  of 386 (Paus  9.1.4),  and  perhaps  in  connection  with  Sparta's  occu- pation  of  the  Kadmeia  in  382  (Isoc. 14,  hypoth.).  They remained  loyal  to  the  Lakedaimonians  after  the  liberation  of Thebes  in  379  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.14),  and  when  the  Thebans  put pressure  on  the  Plataians  to  join  the  Second  Federation,  they refused  (Isoc. 14.8\u00ad9).  As  a  result,  Plataiai  was  conquered 450 hansen and  destroyed  once  again  by  the  Thebans  (Xen.  Hell. 6.3.1, 3.5;Isoc.  14.1,  5,  7,  19,  35,  46),  probably  in  373  (Paus. 9.1.5\u00ad8; Tuplin  ( 1986)  321  n. 2)  rather  than  in  374  (Diod. 15.46.6).This time  the  Plataians  were  allowed  to  go  into  exile  (Paus. 9.1.7). They  found  refuge  in  Athens  once  again,  and  had  their  previous  grant  of  citizenship  renewed  (Diod. 15.46.6;  cf. Isoc. 14.51\u00ad52).The  town  was  still  deserted  and  unfortified in 343  (Dem. 19.21,  112,  325),  but  the  Plataians  were  repatriated by  Philip  II  (Paus. 4.27.10,  9.1.8),  undoubtedly  in  conse- quence  of  the  peace  of 338.  They  took  an  active  part  in  the destruction  of  Thebes  in  335  (Arr.  Anab. 1.8.8;Diod.  17.13.5), whereupon  the  members  of  the  Corinthian  League  decided to  rebuild  and  refortify  Plataiai  (Arr.  Anab. 1.9.10).Yet  it  may have taken  another  four  years  before  the  town and  its  walls were  re-erected  in  331  (Plut.  Alex. 34.2,  Arist. 11.9).  Plataiai provided  one  of  the  naopoioi  of 336/5  and  must  accordingly have  joined  the  Boiotian  Federation  already  before  the destruction  of  Thebes  (CID ii  32.32).  Plataiai  is  attested  in 331  as  providing  one  of  the  hieromnemones  (CID ii  86.13) and  in  C 3e  as  providing  one  of  the  aphedriateuontes;  it  must accordingly  have  been  a  member  of  the  Third  Federation (IG vii  2724.5\u00ad6  (c. 280\u00ad270)).  Plataian  citizens  were appointed  proxenoi  by  Aigina  (no. 358)  (Hdt. 9.85.3), Lakedaimon  (no. 345)  (Thuc. 3.52.5),  and  Chios  (no. 840) (PEP  Chios 50  (C 4m)). The  protecting  god  of  Plataiai  was  Hera  (Plut.  Arist. 18.1 (r 479)),  whose  sanctuary  before  the  destruction  of  Plataiai in 427  was  outside  the  city  (Hdt. 9.52.1),  whereas  the  temple for  Hera  built  by  the  Thebans  in  427/6  was  probably  inside the  walls  alongside  a  new  katagogeion  measuring  200  200 feet  (Thuc. 3.68.3).  The  goddess  was  worshipped  by  the Plataians  at  a  festival  called  the  \"Little\"  Daidala.  At  irregular intervals  were  held  the  Greater  Daidala,  in  which  several Boiotian  poleis  participated--in the end perhaps all Boiotian  poleis.  The  key  features  were  a  procession  carrying a  log  dressed  like  a  woman  and  a  sacrifice in which the ani- mals  were  burned  up  completely,  together  with  the  wooden altar  on  which  they  were  placed  (Paus. 9.2.7\u00ad3.9;Schachter ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 242\u00ad50).  The  hostel  built  by  the  Thebans  indi- cates  that  the  Daidala  were  an  inter-polis  festival  already  in C 5s,  and  C 6  terracotta  figurines have been interpreted as evidence  of  the  festival  in  the  Archaic  period  (Schachter ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 244).What  we  know  about  the  festival,  however, belongs  in  the  Hellenistic  period  (Knoepfler ( 2001a)).  After the  victory  in  479  Pausanias  made  a  sacrifice t o  Zeus Eleutherios  in  the  agora  of  Plataiai  (Thuc. 2.71.2\u00ad4),  and thereafter  the  Plataians  carried  out  annual  rituals  in  honour of  the  fallen  (Thuc. 3.58.4;Isoc.  14.61);  but  a  regular  cult  of Zeus  Eleutherios  and  the  associated  festival  of  Eleutheria were  not  instituted  until  C 3  (Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  iii. 124\u00ad43).  The  most  famous  temple  in  Plataiai  was  that  of Athena  Araia,  with  a  cult  image  by  Pheidias  and  paintings  by Polygnotos  and  Onasias  (Paus. 9.4.1\u00ad2;Plut.  Arist 20.3). Plataiai  was  a  fortified city when attacked b y  Thebes  in  431 (Thuc. 2.4.4,  75.4),  but  in  426  the  walls  were  demolished (Thuc. 3.68.3),  and  were  not  re-erected  until  after  the  King's Peace of 386,  now  with  Spartan  help  (Paus. 9.1.6).  This  cir- cuit,  however,  was  destroyed  once  again  by  the  Thebans  in 373  (Isoc. 14.19,  35;Dem.  6.30),  and  new  walls  were  built  only after  the  sack  of  Thebes  in  335  (Arr.  Anab. 1.9.10).Remains  of all  three  phases  are  still  to  be  seen:  ( 1)  Plataiai  had  no  proper acropolis,  but  the  oldest  part  of  the  settlement  to  the  north- west,  an  area  of 10  ha,  was  enclosed  by  a  wall  in  Lesbian masonry--probably the one that was demolished in  426.(2) A  new  and  much  larger  wall  in  polygonal  masonry  with interval  towers  enclosed  an  area  of 80  ha.  ( 3)  Refounded  in 335,  the  city  was  protected  by  a  wall  of  coursed  ashlar  blocks enclosing  an  area  of 70  ha  (Fossey  ( 1988)  102\u00ad7).  The  settle- ment  can  be  traced  back  to  the  Neolithic  period  and  there are  remains  of  the  Geometric,  Archaic  and  Classical  periods (Fossey  ( 1988)  109).  Traces  of  a  (still  undated)  orthogonal town  plan  have  been  found  in  recent  excavations  (AR ( 1999\u00ad2000)  57). Plataiai  struck  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard  from  c. 386 (or  earlier)  to  374  (or  later).  Denominations:  hemidrachm, diobol,  obol;  obv.  Boiotian  shield;  rev.  head  of  Hera.

The  toponym  is  ,  (Hom. Il. 2.502)  or  more  frequently  in  the  plural  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3;  F.Delphes iii.3103.3  ( 300\u00ad280)),  denoting  the  polity (Hell.

The  earliest  attestation  of  Thisbai  as  a  polis  is  in  a  treaty with  Chorsiai  of  C 2e  (SEG 3342.4  Migeotte  ( 1984)  no. 11), and  the  only  attestation  in  a  literary  source  is  Paus. 9.32.2. The  occurrence  in  C 4l  of  a  Thisban  among  the  aphedria- teuontes,  however,  shows  that  Thisbai  was  a  polis  at  least from  the  beginning  of  the  Third  Federation  (IG vii  2724b.6 (c. 280\u00ad270)),  and  the  reference  at  Hell.  Oxy. 19.3  to  what  was probably  a  sympoliteia  between  Thespiai  (no. 222),  Eutresis (no. 205)  and  Thisbai  suggests  that  during  the  First Federation  Thisbai  was  a  dependent  polis  dominated  by Thespiai  (Roesch  ( 1965)  37;  Siewert  ( 1977)  463;  Hansen ( 1995a)  16);  cf.        (SEG 31  358.5  (C 5f)).  The  size  of  its  territory  has  been  assessed  at just  over  100  km \u00b2  (Fossey  ( 1988)  176).  A  funeral  epigram  of c. 500  indicates  that  the  population  of  Thisbai  consisted  of citizens  (astoi)  and  foreigners  (xenoi)  (CEG 112). The  only  cults  at  Thisbai  attested  in  sources  of  the  Archaic and  Classical  periods  are  of  Athena  (IG vii  2230  (C 6\u00adC5); Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 133)  and,  perhaps,  Demeter  Achaia (BCH 50  ( 1926)  418  n. 4  (C 3s);  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 170;for the  date,  see  Vott\u00e9ro  ( 2001)  256). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in Thisbai's  copy  of  a  treaty  with  Chorsiai  (SEG 3342  Migeotte ( 1984)  no. 11  (C 2e)),  but  externally  only  in  a  Roman  inscrip- tion  (IG vii  2870.13  ( ad  155)).  For  the  individual  and  external use,  see  e.g.  '\u00b5   in  a  list  of aphedriateuontes  (IG vii  2724b.4  (c. 280\u00ad270)).  The  territory was  called  (Xen.  Hell. 6.4.3). Thisbai  is  attested  as  a  member  of  the  First  Federation (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3)  and  of  the  Third  Federation  (IG vii  2724b.4 (c. 280\u00ad270)). A  circuit  of  c. 2.5  km  with  interval  square  towers  enclosed the  city,  which  was  situated  with  a  rocky  hill  to  the  north,  the foot  of  Mt.  Helikon  to the  south,  and  in  the  narrow  corridor between  the  two.  Most  of  the  wall  is  of  pseudo-isodomic 458 hansen trapezoidal  or  ashlar  work,  but  one  round  tower  on  the northern  hill  (the  acropolis)  is  in  Lesbian  masonry  (Maier ( 1958)).  The  circuit  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 48.5  ha  (Bintliff ( 1997a)  244).  Maier  ( 1958)  24\u00ad25  suggests  a  date  between c. 325  and 175,  but  the  tower  indicates  a  date  between  375  and 325  (Buckler  ( 1980)  283  n. 19)  and  Camp  ( 2000)  43  suggests  a date  of 375\u00ad60.  No  remains  of  buildings  have  been  ident- ified.  The  settlement  can  be  traced  back  to  the  early  Helladic period,  and  there  are  remains  of  the  Geometric,  Archaic  and Classical  periods  (Fossey  ( 1988)  180). boiotia  459", "Akraiphia": "Identifier: 199. , (Akraiphieus)  Map  55.

The  city-ethnic  is (Ducat  ( 1971)  no. 260  SEG 31  393  (C 5f))  or  (in literary  sources  only)  (Theopomp.  (FGrHist 115)  fr. 362); ,  (Ephor.  fr. 229). Akraiphia  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Hdt. 8.135.1)  and  in  the  political  sense  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  a  dedication  from  Ptoion  (LSAG 93  and 95  no. 13;  SEG 22 430  (both  C 6l))  and  externally  on  a  boundary  stone  of C 4f\u00adC3m  (IG vii  2792;  cf.Vott\u00e9ro  ( 2001)  115).The  individual use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  a  dedication:    [] (LSAG  93  and 95  no. 15  (c. 500))  and externally  in  a  list  of  aphedriateuontes  (IG vii  2724a.2 (c. 280\u00ad270)). An  inscription  of  C 4f\u00adC3m  cut  in  the  rock  near  Vristika marked  the  border  between  Akraiphia  and  Kopai  (no. 209) as  determined  by  the  Boiotians  (IG vii  2792;  SEG 36  411; Lauffer  ( 1986)  136;  Vott\u00e9ro  ( 2001)  115),  and,  similarly,  a  C 6 horos  (Vott\u00e9ro  ( 2001)  117)  probably  records  the  border between  the  two  poleis  (SEG 30  440,  42  407):  [h  ] [ ] [].The size of  the  territory  has been  assessed  at  c. 35  km \u00b2  (Fossey  ( 1988)  264,  198). The  eponymous  official of  Akraiphia  was  an  archon (LSAG 93  and 95  no. 13  (C 6l)).  In  C 4e  Akraiphia  was  united with  Chaironeia  (no. 201)  and  Kopai,  and  constituted  one  of the  eleven  Boiotian  districts  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3).  The  principal body  of  government  was  a  boule  to which  only  propertied citizens  were  admitted  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.2,3).There  is  no  explic- it  evidence  for  membership  of  the  Second  Federation whereas  the  attestation  of  an  aphedriateuon  from  Akraiphia testifies t o  membership  of  the  Third  Federation  (IG vii 2724.a.2  (c. 280\u00ad270)).  An  eponymous  archon  is  attested  in C 6s  (LSAG 93,  95  no. 13). The  protecting  god  of  Akraiphia  was  perhaps  Zeus  of some  sort  (IG vii  2733  (C 5);  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  iii. 93\u00ad95); cf.  the  C 6l\u00adC5e  dedication  to  Zeus  Oporeus  (SEG 46  528). On  Mt.  Ptoion  (Paus. 9.23.5\u00ad7;  Pind.  frr. 51b,52f),c.4  km  east of  Akraiphia,  was  an  oracular  shrine  (Hdt. 8.135;  Pind.  fr. 52g.A),  since  C 7m  consecrated  to  Apollo  Ptoieus  (Ducat ( 1971)  89  no. 50b  (c. 640);  IG vii  27\u00ad29  (c. 640\u00ad620),  4155 (C 4l))  in  association  with  a  goddess  and  served  by  a  male Akraiphian  prophet  (IG vii  4155).  The  oracle  was  especially famous  in  C 6s  (Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 52\u00ad73).Dedications  of this  period  abound  (Ducat  ( 1971);  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  iii. 295),including  two  by  the  Alkmaionids  and  Peisistratids  (IG i\u00b3  1469\u00ad70).  At  the  sanctuary  are  remains  of  a  peribolos,an oracular  cave  and  a  temple  of  C 4l  built  on  top  of  an  older one  (Lauffer  ( 1959)  1528\u00ad40).  The  sanctuary  was  controlled by  Akraiphia  in  the  Archaic  period  (Ducat  ( 1971)  448\u00ad50)  as well  as  in  the  Hellenistic  age  (IG vii  4139.20\u00ad21  (C 2l);  Roesch ( 1982)  225ff);  but  when  the  oracle  was  consulted  by  Mys  in 479,  it  was  under  Theban  control  (Hdt. 8.135.1;  cf.  Strabo 9.2.34).  The  Thebans  may  have  dispossessed  the Akraiphians  of  the  oracle  in  C 6s  (Gullath  ( 1989)  166),  but  a preferable  explanation  is  that  \"the  oracle  may  have remained  within  the  direction  of  Akraiphia,  although  for- mally  the  sanctuary  and  the  territory  of  Akraiphia  were under  Theban  control\"  (Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 69). boiotia  437 Halfway  (as  the  crow  flies) between Akraiphia and the sanctuary  of  Apollo  Ptoieus  was  a  sanctuary  of  the  Hero Ptoios,  the  descendant  of  Athamas,  here  worshipped  in association  with  some  goddess.  A  lower  terrace  has  altars and  a  stoa  of  the  Archaic  period,  the  upper  terrace  a  temple of  C 4l  built  over  a  C 7  edifice.  Between  the  two  levels  is  an avenue  of  monumental  tripod  bases,  dedicated  by  the  polis of  Akraiphia  c. 525\u00ad450  (IG vii  2734\u00ad35;  SEG 22  430; Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  iii. 11\u00ad21). The  acropolis  was  fortified w ith  a  double-faced  wall:  an outer  face  of  hard  limestone  in  trapezoidal  coursed  mason- ry,  perhaps  of  C 4,  and  an  inner  face  of  poros  stone  in  ashlar coursed  masonry,  built  in  C 3  and  probably  destroyed  in  196. A  diateichisma  in  polygonal  work is  either  contemporary with  or  older  than  the  limestone  wall.  There  are  substantial remains  of  a  pentagonal  tower  of  the  Hellenistic  period.  The circuit  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 17  ha  (Fossey  ( 1988)  266\u00ad68; Garlan  ( 1974)  98\u00ad112  and  information  from  John  Camp). The  size  of  the  lower  town  is  unknown  (Bintliff  ( 1997a) 231)  nor  do  we  know  whether  there  was  a  defence  circuit enclosing  the  entire  town.  Buildings  and  streets  have  been uncovered  at  the  western  end  of  the  town,  and  outside  the town  are  four  cemeteries  with  remains  from  the  late Geometric,  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  (Fossey  ( 1988) 268).  So  far,  more  than  2,000  graves  have  been  found  (AR ( 1999\u00ad2000)  56).  The  settlement  can  be  traced  back  to  C 8 (Fossey  ( 1988)  269). Akraiphia  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard from  c. 500  to 480,from 456  to 446,  and  from  386  (or  earlier) to 374  (or  later).

Hell. 5.2.25)  or  in  later  sources  sometimes (Strabo  9.2.26).  Before  506  Theba\u00efs  extended  south of  the  Asopos,  but  in  506  the  river  was  made  the  border between  Thebes  and  Plataiai  (no. 216)  (Hdt. 6.108.6;  Paus. 9.4.4),  and  the  territory  of  Thebes  may  then  have  comprised both  Haliartos  (no. 206)  (inference  from  Hdt. 5.79.2)  and  pre- sumably  Akraiphia  (no. 198)  with  Apollo's  sanctuary  at Ptoion  (Hdt. 8.135.1;  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 69;  cf.  also  Strabo 9.2.34;Paus.  9.23.5).  To  the  east,  Theban  territory  may  have reached  the  coast  and  included  Delion  (Hdt. 6.118.2; Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 46).  After  the  battle  of  Plataiai,  Thebes was  probably  deprived  of  most  of  its  former  territory includ- ing  the  Tetrakomia  (Hdt. 9.43.2;  Fossey  ( 1988)  222\u00ad23,proba- bly  relating  to  the  period  c. 450\u00ad430;  cf.  Hansen  ( 1995a)  37 with  n. 137)  and  Delion  (Thuc. 4.76.4).But  at  the  beginning  of the  Peloponnesian  War  the  Theba\u00efs  must  have  comprised  all the  small  towns  that  joined  the  synoecism  and  had  their  populations  moved  to  Thebes  (Hell.  Oxy. 20.3).  The  size  of  its territory c. 435  has  been  assessed  at  c. 650  km \u00b2  (Bakhuizen ( 1994)  314).In  427/6  the  territory  of  Plataiai  was  incorporated into  Thebes  (Thuc. 3.68.2\u00ad3,5.17.2).In  395  the  Theba\u00efs  consti- tuted  two  of  the  eleven  Boiotian  districts  and  controlled  the two  Plataian  districts  as  well  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3)  plus  Oropos (no. 214)  (Diod. 14.17.1\u00ad3)  and  Aulis  (Xen.  Hell. 3.5.5).  Thebes suffered  its  next  major  set-back  during  the  Spartan  occupa- tion  in  382\u00ad379  (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.25\u00ad36,  4.1\u00ad12),  but  when  the Boiotian  Federation  had  been  re-established  in  378\u00ad374, Thebes  extended  its  territory  to  include  Plataiai  (from  373: Xen.  Hell. 6.3.1;  Paus. 9.1.5\u00ad8),  Thespiai  (after  377:Xen.  Hell. 5.4.46\u00ad48,  but  before  the  autumn  of 371:Xen.  Hell. 6.3.5;Isoc. 8.17),  Kreusis  (Xen.  Hell. 6.4.3)  and  Oropos  (from  366:Xen. Hell. 7.4.1).  We  have  no  information  about  Anthedon  (no. 200)  (Gullath  ( 1989)  164),  and  we  do  not  know  whether Orchomenos  (no. 213)  was  annexed  by  Thebes  after  its destruction  in  364  (Diod. 15.79.3\u00ad6).During  the  Third  Sacred War,  Koroneia  (no. 210)  and  Orchomenos  were  held  by  the Phokians,  but  in  346  Philip  handed  them  back  to  the  Thebans (Dem. 5.21\u00ad22).  Theba\u00efs  must  now  have  been  bordered  by Thisbai,  Haliartos,  Akraiphia,  Tanagra  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.49)  and Athens  (    :  Aeschin. 3.133;  Din. 1.38)  and most  have  covered  c. 800  km \u00b2.In 338  Thebes  lost  Plataiai, Orchomenos  (Paus. 4.27.10),  Thespiai  and  Oropos  (Paus. 1.34.1),  and  after  the  destruction  of  Thebes  in  335,  what remained  of  its  territory  was  given  to  the  neighbouring  cities (Hyp. 6.17;Diod.  18.11.3\u00ad4;Paus.  1.25.4;  Gullath  ( 1982)  77\u00ad82). After  the  victory  at  Plataiai  in  479,Thebes  was  besieged  by the  Greek  army  until  it  surrendered  the  leaders  of  the  454 hansen pro-Persian  faction  (Hdt. 9.86\u00ad88).  Shortly  after  the  out- break  of  the  Peloponnesian  War  many  small  unfortified Boiotian  towns  were  synoecised  with  Thebes,  which  thereby doubled  its  population.  The  towns  merged  with  Thebes included  Erythrai  (no. 203),  Eteonos/Skaphai  (no. 204), Skolos  (no. 219),  (Au)lis,  Schoinos  and  Potniai  (no. 217) (Hell.  Oxy. 20.3;  Demand  ( 1990)  83\u00ad85;  Moggi,  Sin. 197\u00ad204 prefers  a  date  c. 426\u00ad424).From  382  to 379  Thebes  had  to  suf- fer  a  Spartan  occupation  (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.25\u00ad36,  4.1\u00ad12);  and by  the  peace  of 338  a  Makedonian  garrison  was  placed  on  the Kadmeia  (Diod. 16.87.3). In 335  Thebes  was  conquered  by  Alexander  and  razed  to the  ground  (Din. 1.24;Arr.  Anab. 1.7\u00ad9;Diod.  17.7\u00ad14;Plut. Alex. 11.6\u00ad12;  Gullath  ( 1982)  60\u00ad85).  More  than  6,000  men were  killed,  and  the  remaining  population,  some  30,000 men,  women  and  children,  were  exposed  to  andrapodismos and  sold  into  slavery  (Din. 1.24;Arr.  Anab. 1.9.9;Diod. 17.13.3,  14.1;Plut.  Alex. 11.12). Thebes  was  the  leading  member  of  the  First  Federation (Thuc. 4.91.1;  Hell.  Oxy. 19.3);  it  re-established  the  Federation immediately  after  the  liberation  of  the  city  in  379  (Plut.  Pelop. 13.1)  and  dominated  all  the  other  member  states  (Isoc. 14.8\u00ad10;  Aeschin. 3.142);  and  in  spite  of  the  defeat  in  338, Thebes  was  still  a  member  of  the  Third  Federation  between 338  and  the  destruction  of  the  city  in  335  (Arr.  Anab. 1.7.11;CID ii  74.i.72  ( 337/6)). Membership  of  the  Boiotian  Federation  did  not  prevent Thebes  from  joining  one  of  the  major  leagues  or  from  enter- ing  into  alliance  with  other  poleis:  during  the  370s  Thebes was  a  member  of  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  Confederacy (IG ii\u00b2  40,  43.24\u00ad25,  79;  IG ii\u00b2  1607.155)  and  in  339  Athens concluded  an  alliance  with  Thebes,  not  with  the  Boiotian Federation  (Aeschin. 3.142;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 345). Theban  laws  were  traditionally  ascribed  to  Philolaos  of Corinth  (Arist.  Pol. 1274a31\u00ad32),  who  probably  lived  in  C 7s. The  Aristotelian  collection  of  politeiai  included  a Constitution  of  Thebes  (Arist.  frr. 506\u00ad7).  Down to the Spartan  occupation  of  Kadmeia  in  382\u00ad379  Thebes  was  an oligarchy,  in  C 6l\u00adC5e  of  the  narrow  type  (dynasteia:  Thuc. 3.62.3),  later  a  more  moderate  oligarchy  (ibid.;  Arist.  Pol. 1278a25)  ruled  by  a  boule  based  on  a  property qualification (Hell.  Oxy. 19.2).  A  bronze  phiale  of  C 6f  is  dedicated  by  ,  perhaps  members  of  the  nobility (Lazzarini  ( 1976)  no. 920,  cf.  p. 156),  perhaps  a  body  of  offi- cials  (LSAG 92  and 94  no. 7;  cf.  Schachter  ( 1989)  79),  or, rather,  a  military  elite  (Schachter,  forthcoming). The  Athenian  victory  at  Oinophyta  in  457  (Thuc. 1.108.3; Pl.  Menex. 242B)  and  stasis  in  Thebes  (Thuc. 3.62.5,  4.92.6) were  followed  by  a  brief  period  of  democracy  (Arist.  Pol. 1302b28\u00ad9).  The  Athenians  were expelled,  autonomia  recov- ered,  exiles  recalled  and  oligarchy  restored  after  the Athenian  defeat  at  Koroneia  in  447/6  (Thuc. 1.113.2\u00ad4, 3.62.3).  The  principal  body  of  government  was  a  boule,to which  only  propertied  citizens  were  admitted  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.2,  3).  In  C 4e  the  leading  oligarchs  were  divided  into  a  pro- Athenian  and  a  pro-Lakedaimonian  faction  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.1, 20.1),  and  after  a  protracted  stasis  the  pro-Lakedaimonians came  to  power  in  382  with  the  Spartan  occupation  of  Thebes (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.25\u00ad36).  Between  382  and 379  the  constitution was  again  a  dynasteia  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.46).  From  379  onwards Thebes  was  a  democracy  (Diod. 15.79.3;  Polyb. 6.43;  Buckler ( 1980)  20).  In  collusion  with  a  faction  in  Thebes,  some Theban  exiles  made  an  abortive  attempt  in  364  to reintro- duce  an  aristocratic  constitution  (Diod. 15.79.3\u00ad5). Thebes  had  a  boule  (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.29),which  prepared  the matters  to  be  put  to  the  assembly  (Diod. 17.9.1).An  oracular response  refers  to  a  meeting  of  the  popular  assembly  in  506 (Hdt. 5.79.1).  It  is  unknown  what  powers  it  had  during  the oligarchy  down to 379,  but  from  then  on  major  decisions were  made  by  the  people  in  assembly  (Aeschin. 2.105;Dem. 18.213;Ar.  Anab. 1.7.2).  An  eponymous  archon  is  attested  in C 4s  (SEG 28  466  (c. 338))  and  polemarchs  from  382  (Xen. Hell. 5.2.25;  Schaefer  ( 1956)  1108\u00ad11).  Thebes  awarded  proxe- nia  to  citizens  from  Opous  (no. 386)  (schol.  Pind.  Ol. 9.123c (C 5f)),  from  Athens  (no. 361)  (Demosthenes:  Aeschin. 2.141; Thrason:  Aeschin. 3.138),  and  from  unknown  poleis  (IG vii 2409  (C 4m\u00adC3m);  cf.  Vott\u00e9ro  ( 2001)  159;  SEG 28  465  (C 4s)). Theban  citizens  were  appointed  proxenoi  by  Athens  (no. 361)  (Pindar,  Isoc. 15.166),  Delphi  (no. 177)  (F.Delphes iii.1 356  ( 327));  and  Karthaia  (no. 492)  (IG xii.5542.27  (C 4m)). The  protective  divinities  of  Thebes  were  probably Demeter  Thesmophoros  and  Dionysos  Kadmeios  (Pind. Isthm. 7.1\u00ad5;Eur.  Bacch. 1\u00ad12;Xen.  Hell. 5.2.29;  Paus. 9.15.5\u00ad6; Brackertz  ( 1976)  73\u00ad78;  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 168,  187),  but Athena  Onka  (Aesch.  Sept. 164\u00ad65)  and  Athena  Pronoia (ArchDelt 3  ( 1917)  36.2)  are  also  attested  as  the  protectors  of Thebes  (Soph.  OT 18\u00ad19;  SEG 32  493  (C 4l);  Schachter ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 129\u00ad32).  Other  major  divinities  attested  in  the Archaic  and  Classical  periods  are  Herakles  Promachos, whose  sanctuary  was  outside  the  walls  (Pind.  Nem. 4.22\u00ad24; Isoc. 5.32;Xen.Hell.6.4.7;  Paus. 9.11.4;  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  ii. 14\u00ad30);  Aphrodite,  the  divine  patron  of  the  Theban  pole- marchs,  whose  sanctuary  was  on  the  Kadmeia  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.4\u00ad7;  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 38\u00ad41);  Apollo  Ismenios, whose  sanctuary  was  on  the  Ismenion  hill  (IG vii  2455  (C 6); SEG 22  417  (C 6);  Pind.  Pyth. 11.1\u00ad11;  Paus. 9.10.2;Schachter boiotia  455 ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 77\u00ad85).  The  major  extra-urban  cults  were  Zeus Hypatos  (Paus. 9.19.3),  in  whose  sanctuary  on  Mt.  Hypaton some  remains  of  the  Classical  period  have  been  found (Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  iii. 102);  and  the  Kabiroi:  a  mother goddess,  her  consort  and  two  attending  Kabiroi,  usually  rep- resented  as  Hermes  and  Pan.  It  was  a  mystery  cult  reserved for  the  initiated  and  situated  at  the  Kabirion,  a  natural  cavi- ty c. 5.5  km  west  of  Thebes.  Monumental  architecture  at  the sanctuary  dates  from  the  Hellenistic  and  Roman  periods. The  cult  is  attested  from  the  Geometric  to  the  Roman  impe- rial  period  (IG vii  2457  (C 6\u00adC5),  cf.  SEG 36  458;Schachter ( 1986\u00ad94)  ii. 66\u00ad110,(2003)).Theorodokoi  were  appointed  in 359  to  host  theoroi  from  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.1 94.a.4);  in  360/59  Thebes  was  granted  promanteia  by  the Delphians  (no. 177)  (F.Delphes. iii.4375).  The  Theban Ismenias  was  hieromnemon  in 341  (CID ii  43.229). Citizens  of  Thebes  are  frequently  attested  as  victors  at  the major  Panhellenic  festivals,  e.g.  at  the  Isthmian  Games (Pind.  Isthm. 1,  3\u00ad4,  7  (in 474,  458  and 454)),  at  the  Nemean Games  (schol.  Pind.  Isthm. 223.10,  Drachmann  ( 470s)),  at the  Olympic  Games  (Paus. 5.8.7  ( 680);  see  Olympionikai 33, 69,  136,  206,  352,  427,  441),  at  the  Pythian  Games  (Pind.  Pyth. 11  ( 474);  Paus. 10.7.7  (r 378),  7.8  (r 346)),  and  at  the Amphiareia  (IG vii  414.4,  24,  I.Oropos 520  ( 329/8)).  The city  dedicated  a  treasury  at  Delphi  to  commemorate  the  vic- tory  at  Leuktra  (Bommelaer  ( 1991)  129\u00ad30). Thebes  is  called  a  fortified city in c. 540  (Thgn. 1.1209)  and again  in  479  (Hdt. 9.41.2,  9.86\u00ad88),  but  it  is  uncertain whether  the  references  are  to  the  acropolis  wall  or  to  a  wall enclosing  the  lower  city  as  well,  referred  to  at  Xen.  Hell. 5.4.53.  In  C 4  the  city  had  two  circuits  (Arr.  Anab. 1.7.9\u00ad10, 8.5\u00ad6):  an  acropolis  wall  around  the  Kadmeia  with  the  seven famous  gates  (Pind.  Pyth. 11.12;  Paus. 9.8.4)  enclosed  an  area of  c. 32  ha,  and  a  wall  around  the  lower  city  enclosed  an  area of 350  ha  (Bintliff  ( 1997a)  243).  Only  a  few  traces  are  left (Symeonoglou  ( 1985)  119).  The  acropolis  wall  seems  to  have followed  the  line  of  the  late  Helladic  cyclopean  wall,  and  the surviving  traces  of  polygonal  and  isodomic  masonry  may  be no  more  than  Archaic  and  Classical  repairs  of  the  late Helladic  wall  (cf.  Hes.  Scut. 105).  The  short  south  side  of  the acropolis  wall  seems  to  have  been  a  part  of  the  city  wall  as well  (Arr.  Anab. 1.7.9\u00ad10).  The  great  city  wall  was  of  mud- brick  superimposed  on  a  foundation  of  isodomic  masonry and  covered  with  tiles.  The  masonry  suggests  a  C 5  date.  The synoecism  of 431  must  be  the  terminus  ante  quem,  and  the most  likely  terminus  post  quem  seems  to  be  the  liberation  of Boiotia  from  Athenian  domination  in  446  (Symeonoglou ( 1985)  118\u00ad22).The  city  wall  was  demolished  in  335  (Aeschin. 3.157),  but  the  acropolis  wall  was  probably  left  to  protect  the Makedonian  garrison  on  the  Kadmeia  (Hyp. 6.17;Arr.  Anab. 1.9.9). In  the  Archaic  period  much  of  the  Kadmeia  was  inhabit- ed  (Fossey  ( 1988)  204),but  some  Thebans,  including  Pindar, lived  in  the  lower  city  (Paus. 9.25.3),  which  became  densely populated  after  the  erection  of  the  greater  circuit  in  C 5m and  the  synoecism  of  c. 431  (Hell.  Oxy. 20.3).  In  the  Classical period  Thebes  had  at  least  twenty-three  sanctuaries,  twelve on  the  Kadmeia  and  eleven  in  the  lower  city  (Symeonoglou ( 1985)  123\u00ad37).  South-east  of  the  Kadmeia  are  remains  of  the temple  of  Apollo  Ismenias,  built  in  C 8s,  rebuilt  c. 700  and again  in  C 4  (Symeonoglou  ( 1985)  site  8  pp. 236\u00ad8),and  in  the lower  town were found  the  foundations  of  a  temple  of  the Classical  period  (Symeonoglou  ( 1985)  site  229  p. 299).  The Theban  boule  (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.29),  as  well  as  the  federal  coun- cil  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.4)  and  the  Boiotarchs  (Aeschin. 3.145),  had their  meeting  place  on  the  Kadmeia.  In  lower  Thebes  was  the polemarcheion  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.6),  a  hippodrome  (Paus  9.23.2; Symeonoglou  ( 1985)  140  and  cat.  no. 106),  a  C 5  stadion  and gymnasion  (Paus. 9.23.1;  Symeonoglou  ( 1985)  140  cat.  nos. 65,  169);  an  earlier  stadion  and  gymnasion  (of  C 6?)  was  situ- ated  outside  the  walls  (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.25;  Symeonoglou  ( 1985) 108\u00ad9).  The  agora  in  the  lower  city  was  flanked w ith  several stoas  (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.29;Diod.  12.70.5).  Thebes  had  a  theatre (Paus. 9.16.6),  which  in  C 4  was  used  for  meetings  of  the assembly  (Plut.  Mor. 799E\u00adF);  traces  have  been  found  in  the northern  part  of  the  lower  city  (Symeonoglou  ( 1985) 189\u00ad90).  The  city  got  most  of  its  water  through  an  impres- sive  system  of  subterranean  aqueducts  already  famous  in antiquity  (Heracl.  Cret. 13,  GGM i.102)  and  still  partly  pre- served  (Symeonoglou  ( 1985)  141\u00ad44). Thebes  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard  from c. 500  to 335.  Denominations:  stater,  drachm,  hemidrachm, obol,  hemiobol,  tetartemorion,  in  C 4  also  tritemorion;  obv. mostly  Boiotian  shield;  rev.  down  to  479:  mill-sail;  thereafter Herakles  or  Dionysos  or  amphora  with  symbols  relating  to Herakles  or  Dionysos.  Legend:  first  ,later various abbrevi- ations  of  the  city-ethnic  or  occasionally  the  full  form: .  An  abbreviated  personal  name,  denoting  the issuing  magistrate,  appears  on  the  C 4  amphora-type  coins, and  forty-five separate magistrates can be identified (Hepworth  ( 1986)  35).

In  Boiotia  the  city-ethnic  is  either (SEG 25  554  (C 5);  Etienne  and  Knoepfler ( 1976) 221\u00ad25)  or  (IG vii  2724.4\u00ad5  (c. 280\u00ad270));  outside Boiotia  it  is  always  (Thuc. 4.93.4).  For  the  late appearance  of  the  form  ,  see  most  recently Knoepfler ( 1992)  480\u00ad81. Haliartos  is  listed  as  one  of  the  Boiotian  poleis  in Thucydides'  description  of  the  battle  of  Delion  ( 4.91.1,  93.4). It is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Heracl.  Cret. 25  (GGM i.104  (C 3))  and  in  the  political  sense  by  the  Oxyrhynchus  his- torian  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3).The  term  [ ]  (citizenship)  in a  proxeny  and  citizenship  decree  of  C 4l  (SEG 28  453.8) strongly  supports  Knoepfler's r estoration  [ ] in lines 3\u00ad4  of  the  decree  (BCH 102  ( 1978)  381, pace  Fossey  in  Boeotia Antiqua 4  ( 1994)  49\u00ad51). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  the  reverse  of  a  coin  of  C 4f( :Head,  HN \u00b2 345;  see  Etienne  and  Knoepfler ( 1976)  222  n. 771)  and  exter- nally  in  a  C 5  dedication  found  near  Onchestos  (SEG 25  554). boiotia  441 For  the  individual  and  external  use,  see  [ ]  (CID ii 94.5),  a  hieromnemon  of 327. The  territory was  called  (Xen.  Hell. 3.5.17)  or (Strabo  9.2.33;  Paus. 9.33.4).  Together  with Lebadeia  (no. 211)  and  Koroneia  (no. 210),  Haliartos  consti- tuted  one  of  the  eleven  Boiotian  districts  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3). The  size  of  the  territory  has  been  assessed  at  c. 80  km \u00b2  (Fossey ( 1988)  300).  It  comprised  Onchestos  (Strabo  9.2.33;  SEG 25 554;  Etienne  and  Knoepfler ( 1976)  223;  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  ii. 206),  Tilphossa  and  Okalea,  as  well  as  Medeon  (Strabo 9.2.26).  A  line  of  fortifications,  now  dated  to  371  (Fossey ( 1992)  112\u00ad14),  indicates  the  border  of  the  city  towards Koroneia  (Fossey  ( 1988)  320).  The  Cambridge/Bradford  sur- vey  of  Boiotia  has  revealed  that  there  is  a  band  of  almost empty  territory  running  east\u00adwest  just  north  of  Askra,  prob- ably  the  border  zone  between  the  territory  of  Haliartos  and that  of  Thespiai  (no. 222)  (Snodgrass  ( 1990)  129).  The Thebans'  remark  at  Hdt. 5.79.2  that  the  Koroneians  and Thespians  are  their  neighbours  indicates  that  Haliartos  in 507/6  was  a  dependent  polis  and  situated  in  what  was  then  the territory  of  either  Koroneia  or  Thebes. Haliartos  was  a  member  of  the  First  Federation  (Hell. Oxy. 19.3),and  the  principal  body  of  government  was  a  boule to  which  only  propertied  citizens  were  admitted  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.2,  3).  Haliartos  was  a  member  of  the  Third  Federation;  it provided  one  of  the  hieromnemones  in 327  (CID ii  94.5)  and one  of  the  aphedriateuontes  in  c. 280\u00ad270  (IG vii  2724b.2). We  have  no  evidence  relating  to  the  Second  Federation.  In C 4l  Haliartos  seems  to  have  awarded  proxenia  and  politeia  to a  citizen  from  an  unknown  polis  (SEG 28  453,  restored). On  the  acropolis  have  been  found  the  remains  of  an Archaic  sanctuary  with  a  stoa  (Coulton  ( 1976)  240)  and  a temple  of  Athena  (C 7\u00adC6),  and  the  protecting  god  of Haliartos  was  probably  Athena  Itonia  (SEG 32  456.8\u00ad9,cf.44 408  (C 3l);  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 116).  Cults  of  Dionysos, Alkmene  and  the  hero  Aleas  have been  inferred  from  Plut. Lys. 28  (Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 9\u00ad10,  11\u00ad12,  176). A  small  circuit  of  cyclopean  masonry  (Mycenaean?)  with Lesbian  (Archaic?)  and  trapezoidal  (Classical?)  repairs encloses  the  acropolis.  An ashlar  circuit,  probably  of  C 4, encloses  the  lower  city  and  covers  an  area  of  c. 42  ha  (Fossey ( 1988)  301\u00ad5;  Bintliff  ( 1997a)  244).  Haliartos  was  fortified when  attacked  by  Lysandros  in  395/4  (Xen.  Hell. 3.5.17\u00ad19; Diod. 14.81.2;  Paus. 3.5.3\u00ad5).  All  three  passages  refer  to  a  cir- cuit  wall  enclosing  the  whole  city  and  not  just  the  acropolis. Haliartos  seems  to  have  been  an  early  Iron  Age  settlement located  in  and  round  the  acropolis,  and  from  there  it  spread down  the  slope  to  the  south.  The  settlement  can  be  traced back  to  the  Neolithic  period  (Fossey  ( 1988)  305\u00ad6).  The urban  centre  reached  its  maximum  size  in  C 4  (Bintliff  and Snodgrass  ( 1988)  61\u00ad65).  An  important  Classical  cemetery outside  Haliartos  is  reported  in  AR  ( 1999\u00ad2000)  56. Haliartos  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard from  c. 456  to 446  and  from  c. 400  (or  earlier)  to  374  (or  later), and  bronze  coins  from  c. 338  to 315.(1)  Silver, 456\u00ad446: denominations:  stater,  triobol,  obol,  tetartemorion;  obv.

The  Archaic coins  inscribed  with  an  epichoric  H  and  traditionally assigned  to  Haliartos  are  now  believed  to  have  been  struck by  Hyettos  (no. 207;  Etienne  and  Knoepfler ( 1976)  218\u00ad26). Conversely,  Etienne  and  Knoepfler ( 1976)  221  n. 768  suggest that  the  C 5e  issues  usually  ascribed  to  Akraiphia  (no. 198) may  have  been  minted  at  (H)aliartos). 207.Hyettos  (Hyettios) Map  55.

The  earliest  explicit  reference  to  Hyettos  as  a  polis  is  in  a military  catalogue  of  c. 250  (SEG 26  498.3\u00ad4).

Type:  A.  The  toponym  is ,  (Hom.  Il. 2.498;  Thuc. 7.29.2\u00ad3),  denoting either  the  town  (Thuc. 7.29.3\u00ad4)  or  the  polity  (Thuc. 7.30.3) or  the  territory (Hom.  Il. 2.498).  The  city-ethnic  is (Thuc. 7.30.3).  Neither  the  toponym  nor  the city-ethnic  is  attested  in  epigraphical  sources. Mykalessos  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  and  in  the political  sense  by  Thuc. 7.29\u00ad30.According  to  Strabo  it  was  a kome  ( 9.2.11,  14),  whereas  Paus. 9.19.4,  retrospectively, describes  Mykalessos  as  the  ruins  of  a  polis. The  collective  form  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internal- ly  in  abbreviated  form  on  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in Thuc. 7.30.3,  paraphrased  by  Pausanias  at  1.23.3. In  the  Hellenistic  and  Roman  periods  Mykalessos  was located  in  the  territory  of  Tanagra  (no. 220)  (Strabo  9.2.11, 14;  Paus. 9.19.8),and  that  seems  to  have  been  the  case  already in  C 5e  (Fossey  ( 1988)  83\u00ad84,  222\u00ad23;  Hansen  ( 1995a)  36\u00ad37). Within  the  Tanagraian  territory,  however,  Mykalessos  had its  own  territory,  called  ,  which  seems  to  have stretched  as  far  as  the  Euboian  Gulf  (Paus. 9.19.5;  Bakhuizen ( 1970)  20\u00ad21,  148\u00ad49),  and  so  its  area  must  be  assessed  as  at least 50  and  perhaps  more  than  100  km \u00b2. In 413  the  city  was  sacked  by  Thrakian  mercenaries,  and  a large  part  of  the  population  was  killed  (Thuc. 7.29\u00ad30). Mykalessos  was  walled,  but  the  circuit  was  not  very  high, and  parts  of  it  had  collapsed  (Thuc. 7.29.3).  The  wall  reported  by  Lolling  ( 1989)  508  may  have  been  the  remains  of a  circuit  (Fossey  ( 1988)  80\u00ad81).  Thucydides  describes Mykalessos  as  a  small  polis,  and  apart  from  houses  the  only buildings  mentioned  are  some  sanctuaries  and  a  school (Thuc. 7.29.4\u00ad5).  At  the  site  are  remains  of  an  undated  cir- cuit  wall  in  polygonal  masonry  and  considerable  architec- tural  fragments.  The  settlement  can  be  traced  back  to  EH  ii and  there  are  remains  of  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods (Fossey  ( 1988)  80\u00ad83).  The  large  cemetery  testifies t o  a  peak of  population  in  C 6s  (Ure  ( 1940);  Sparkes  ( 1967)  128\u00ad30). Mykalessos  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard from  c. 500  to 480  and  from  386  (or  earlier)  to  374  (or  later).

Lat. 38.30,long. 22.55.  Size  of  territory: 2.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is ,  (Thuc. 1.113.1;  F.Delphes iii.396  SEG 32  529 (c. 313\u00ad300)),  but  in  some  Boiotian  inscriptions  [] (IG vii  3170.10  (C 3))  or  (SEG 38  380.1  (C 1)).  The toponym  denotes  either  the  town  (Thuc. 1.113.1)  or  the  polity  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3)  or  the  territory  (Lycurg. 1.16). The  city-ethnic  is  (SEG 15  282.4  ( 263\u00ad255)). Chaironeia  is  called  a  polis  presumably  in  the  urban  sense (Hecat.  fr. 116;  cf.  Hansen  ( 1995a)  55  n. 44)  and  in  the  politi- cal  sense  (Thuc. 4.76.3,  89.2;  cf.  Hansen  ( 1995a)  21\u00ad24; Theopomp.  fr. 407;  Hell.  Oxy. 19.3).  The  term  \u00b5  is used  by  Aristophanes  Boeotus  (FGrHist 379)  fr. 3  (C 4)). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally as on  coins  of  C 4e  (Head  ( 1881)  44)  and  exter- nally  by Polyb. 27.1.4.  For  the  individual  use  of  the  city- ethnic,  see  e.g.    (SEG 15  282.4,  grammateus  ( 263\u00ad255)). The  territory is  called  (Lycurg. 1.16:   \u00b5),  and  it  was  the  westernmost  region  of Boiotia,  bordered  by  Phokis  to  the  west  (Thuc. 4.76.3;  cf. Hecat.  fr. 116)  and  by  Orchomenos  (no. 213)  to  the  north (Plut.  Cim. 2.1).  In  C 5f  its  territory  was  a  part  of  the  territory of  Orchomenos  (inference  from  Hdt. 8.34.1).  The  size  of  the territory  has  been  assessed  at  c. 55  km \u00b2  (Fossey  ( 1988)  342). In C 5  Chaironeia  was  a  dependent  polis  under Orchomenos  (  '\u00b5:  Theopomp.  fr. 407, probably  referring  to 446;  '\u00b5 :  Thuc. 4.76.3,  referring  to 424),  and  was  perhaps  without  any  repre- sentation  in  the  federal  government.  In 395,however, Chaironeia  was  united  with  Akraiphia  (no. 198)  and  Kopai (no. 209),  and  constituted  one  of  the  eleven  Boiotian  districts (Hell.  Oxy. 19.3).It  is  not  known  when  Chaironeia  changed  its status  from  an  Orchomenian  dependency  to one  of  the  six poleis  that  provided  one  Boiotarch every  third  year.  The  prin- cipal  body  of  government  was  a  boule,  to  which  only  proper- tied  citizens  were admitted  (Hell.  Oxy. 19.2,3).Chaironeia  was a  member  of  the  Second  Federation  ( ,Diod. 16.39.8)  and  of  the  Third  Federation  as  well  (IG vii  2724c.6 ( 245\u00ad240)).  After  457  Chaironeia  and  Orchomenos  served  as a  refuge  for  oligarchs  from  the  other  Boiotian  poleis  (Hellan. fr. 81);  but  in  446  Chaironeia  was  conquered  by the  Athenians and  exposed  to  andrapodismos  (Thuc. 1.113.1;  Theopomp.  fr. 407).From  the  abortive  attempt  in  424  to  introduce  a  democ- racy,  we  can  infer  that  Chaironeia  must  have  had  an  oli- garchic  constitution.  The  democratic  faction  was  supported by  Athens  and  by some  Orchomenians,  but  the  stasis  was quelled  by  armed  assistance  from  the  other  Boiotians  (Thuc. 4.76.2\u00ad3,  89.2;  Hansen  ( 1995a)  21\u00ad24). Chaironeia  must  have  been  fortified in  424  (Thuc. 4.89.2) and  again  in  354  when  the  town  was  besieged  by Onomarchos  (Diod. 16.33.4;  cf.  Buckler  ( 1989)  56).  On  the acropolis  there  are  remains  of  ( 1)  a  circuit  of  cyclopean masonry,  probably  of  the  Archaic  period;  ( 2)  Lesbian blocks,  presumably  Archaic;  ( 3)  a  C 4  ashlar  circuit.  Small extensions  at  the  north-east  corner  of  the  cyclopean  wall and  at  the  north-west  corner  of  the  ashlar  wall  suggest  that the  lower  city  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  was walled  and  lay  north  of  the  acropolis.  The  acropolis  walls enclose  an  area  of  c. 15  ha.  The  size  of  the  lower  city  is unknown  (Fossey  ( 1988)  376\u00ad79);  Bintliff  's  guesstimate  is c. 23  ha  (( 1997a)  244).  The  settlement  can  be  traced  back  to the  early  Helladic  period  (Fossey  ( 1988)  380).  Of  public architecture  the  only  known  building  is  a  small  rock-cut theatre.  A rectilinear  koilon  with  eight  steps,  probably  of  the Classical  period,  was  replaced  in  the  early  Hellenistic  period by  a  curvilinear  koilon  of  which  fifteen steps are preserved (Dilke  45  ( 1950)  35\u00ad37;  Isler  ( 1994)  146). boiotia  439 The  protecting  god  of  Chaironeia  may  have  been  Zeus (Paus. 9.41.6;  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  iii. 99).  Other  major divinities  presumably  worshipped  in  the  Archaic  and Classical  periods  are  Apollo  Thourios  (Plut.  Sulla 17.7,inter- preted  retrospectively  by Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 43\u00ad44)  with an  extra-urban  sanctuary  at  Thourion  (Camp  et al.( 1992) 454\u00ad55),  Dionysos  (Plut.  Cim. 2.2;  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 173\u00ad74)  and  Herakles  (Plut.  Dem. 19.2;  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94) ii. 2). Chaironeia  struck  hemidrachms  on  the  Aiginetan  stan- dard  and  bronze  coins  between  386  (or  earlier)  and  374  (or later).  ( 1)  Silver:  obv.  Boiotian  shield;  rev.  club.

Type:  A.  The  toponym  ,  (Dem. 19.141  codd.  AY;  Harp. 77;  Ps.-Skylax 38)  is  attested in  literary  sources,  and  from  the  city-ethnic  (SEG 3342;  Migeotte  ( 1984)  no. 11  (C 2e))  we  can  infer  that  in  the Boiotian  dialect  the  toponym  must  have  been  , which  is  the  spelling  offered  by  Steph.  Byz.  at  696.1,  and  per- haps  attested  in  the  Delphic  list  of  theorodokoi  of  c. 230\u00ad210 (SEG 36  500).  It  has  been  suggested  that  the   referred  to by Demosthenes  must  be  in north-west Boiotia  near  East  Lokris  (Etienne  and  Knoepfler ( 1976) 32\u00ad41),  but  Demosthenes'  mention  of  Orchomenos  (no. 213),  Koroneia  (no. 210)  and  Tilphoseion  side  by  side  with ,  as  well  as  the  notes  in  Harp.  and  Ps.-Skylax, strongly  support  the  traditional  location  of  the  site  in  south- ern  Boiotia. Ps.-Skylax 38  lists  Chorsiai  as  the  first t oponym  after  the heading  ,  where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense, and  the  settlement  is  presumably  called  a  polis  by Theopomp.  fr. 167  Harp. 77,  quoting  Dem. 19.141  for  the toponym  and  Theopompos  for  the  site-classification. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally in  a  treaty  with  Thisbai  (SEG 3342  (C 2e))  and  internally  in  a proxeny  decree  (SEG 22  410  (C 2f)).There  is  no  attestation  of the  individual  use. The  name  of  the  territory  is  unknown;  its  size  has  been assessed  at  c. 40  km \u00b2  (Fossey  ( 1988)  186).  A  C 4finventory of hestiatorion  equipment,  presumably  found  in  Chorsiai, indicates  that  Chorsiai  in  C 4e  was  a  dependent  polis  lying inside  the  territory  of  Thespiai  (no. 222)  (SEG 24  361,  30  441 ( 386\u00ad380),  but  cf. 47  520).  The  inscription  testifies t o  a Heraion  and  a  cult  of  Hera  in  Chorsiai  (Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94) i. 238).  For  a  possible  cult  of  Zeus  Soter,  see  SEG 36  417 (C 6\u00adC4  but  heavily  restored:  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  iii. 99\u00ad100). In 346  Chorsiai  was  destroyed  by  the  Thebans,  had  its walls  demolished  and,  like  Orchomenos  and  Koroneia,  the city  was  perhaps  exposed  to  an  andrapodismos  (Dem. 19.141).The  epigraphical  and  archaeological  evidence  shows that  the  city  was  soon  resettled. The  only  reference  in  written  sources  to  walls  is \u00b5  at  Diod. 16.58.1,  describing  the  Phokians'  occu- pation  of  Chorsiai  during  the  Sacred  War  down to 346. Remains  of  a  coursed  trapezoidal  wall  enclosed  both  the acropolis  and  the  lower  town  on  the  east,  north  and  west sides,  whereas  the  south  side  was  protected  by  cliffs.  This  cir- cuit  seems  to  date  from  the  years  after  the  battle  of  Leuktra;  it was  probably  destroyed  by  the  Thebans  in  346  (Dem. 19.141), but  re-erected  later  on  in  C 4  in  isodomic  ashlar  work.  The walls  enclose  residential  quarters  of  c. 1  ha  (B\u00fcsing  and B\u00fcsing-Kolbe  ( 1972)  79\u00ad87;  Fossey  ( 1986).  According  to Bintliff  ( 1997a)  244,the  habitation  area  amounted  to  between 1.7  and 4.5  ha.  The  settlement  can  be  traced  back  to  the  early Helladic  period,  and  there  are  remains  of  the  Geometric, Archaic  and  Classical  periods  (Fossey  ( 1988)  193). 203.Erythrai  Map. 54.

Hansen  ( 1995a)  32,  48). The  only  other  attestation  of  the  ethnic  is  as  an  epithet  to Glaukos,  the  heroic  founder  of  Anthedon:  (Aesch.  frr. 450\u00ad53,  Mette;  cf.  Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94) i. 228). We  have  no  information  about  the  name  of  the  territory. Potniai  was  one  of  the  small  unwalled  settlements  whose population  was  moved  to  Thebes  (Hell.

The  absence  of  physical remains  of  the  Hellenistic  period  (Fossey  ( 1988)  209)  may indicate  that,  unlike  the  other  small  towns  synoecised  with Thebes  in  431,  Potniai  was  not  resettled.  Potniai  was  famous for  its  sanctuary  of  Demeter  and  Kore  (Paus. 9.8.1),  which was  an  ancient  one  (Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 159\u00ad60).  The  set- tlement  can  be  traced  back  to  the  Protogeometric  period (Fossey  ( 1988)  209),  but  po-ti-ni-ja  on  a  Theban  Linear  B tablet  suggests  that  Potniai  was  inhabited  in  the  Mycenaean period  too  (Schachter  ( 1981\u00ad94)  i. 159). 218.

Well  known,  e.g.  as  a  member of  the  Delian  League,  this  polis  (destroyed  and  refounded  by the  Bithynian  king  Zipoites  near  the  former  site)  took  the name  Nikomedeia  in  early  C 3.  Therefore,  all  Astak(en)oi attested  in  Hellenistic  inscriptions  must  be  seen  as  citizens of  the  Akarnanian  polis,  e.g.  the  paroikos  Nikon  Astakenos  at Rhamnous  (SEG 43  53  (C 3  after  229)).  Only  the   (SEG 4  105  (Rome,  first c entury  ad))  may  refer poetically  to  Nikomedeia,  cf.  e.g.  Nonnus,  Dion. 14.327, 16.166  or  Anth.  Pal. 7.627.3. Astakos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skylax 34,  who  also  classifies A stakos  as  a  limen.  Thuc. 2.30.1  has . The  collective  use  of  the  equivalent  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  externally  in  an  Athenian  inscription  (IG ii\u00b2  266) and  internally  on  a  stamped  tile  (IG ix\u00b2.1443  (C 3\u00adC2)).  The individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in,  e.g., SEG 43  53  (Rhamnous,  C 3),  see  n. 7.  The  bay  near  Astakos  is named    by Strabo 10.2.21. Steph.  Byz. 137.6  calls  Astakos     , but,  according  to Kirsten  (( 1940)  298),  it  may  have  been  a colony  of  Corinth  (no. 227),  like  Anaktorion  (no. 114), Ambrakia  (no. 113)  and  Leukas  (no. 126;  cf.  Wacker  ( 1996a) 99  with  n. 6;  Schoch  ( 1997)  42;  contra  Klaffenbach  ( 1957a)  x). According  to  the  theorodokoi  lists,  Astakos  was  part  of Akarnania  (IG iv\u00b2.195.8  14  ( 356/5)).After  the  expulsion  of the  tyrant  Euarchos  in  431  (Thuc. 2.30.1),  repeated  after  his return  in 429,  Astakos  became  an  Athenian  ally  and,  proba- bly,  a  member  of  the  Akarnanian  Confederacy  (cf.  Gomme ad  Thuc. 2.102.1).  The  membership  is  attested  only  later  (IG ix\u00b2.1  208,  209  (C 2)).  Theorodokoi  to  host  theoroi  are  attested in  Epidauros  (no. 348;  IG iv\u00b2.195.14,  63  ( 356/5))  and  in Nemea  (SEG 36  331.A.52\u00ad53  ( 331/30\u00ad313)). Ruins  of  a  sanctuary  of  Zeus  Kara(i)os  have  been  found 200  m  west  of  the  western  gate;  they  can  be  identified b y  an inscription  of  C 2  (IG ix\u00b2.1434).  The  remains  of  the  ancient walls,  visible  today  as  foundations  of  a  mediaeval  wall,  are poorly  preserved  (Wacker  ( 1996a)  101).  The  masonry  sug- gests  different  phases  (Murray  ( 1982)  69\u00ad70),  the  first being probably  C 5  (Oberhummer  ( 1887)  212;  Philippson  and Kirsten  ( 1958)  395). Astakos  struck  silver  coins  perhaps  only  in  C 4s,  on  the Corinthian  standard  and  with  Corinthian  types:  obv.

The  city-ethnic  is  (IAEpi 42.61,  65  (C 3);  Diod. 19.67.4  (r 314))  or  (IG ix\u00b2.1 3A.23  ( 263?)). Derion  is  probably  to  be  connected  with  the  ruins  at Skourtou  in  central  Akarnania  (Rhomaios  ( 1918)  113\u00ad14;  cf. the  discussion  by  Pritchett  ( 1992)  81\u00ad85);  it  is  not  attested  as a  polis  in  our  sources.  If  the  identification w ith  the  ruins  of Skourtou  is  correct,  Derion  had  an  urban  centre  and  may have  been  a  polis  already  in  C 5\u00adC4,  not  just  one  of  the   attested  in  IG ix\u00b2.1583.40  (Olympia, 216). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally by Diod. 19.67.4  (r 314).  The  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic is  attested  externally  in  an  inscription  from  the  Asklepieion at  Epidauros  (IAEpi 42.61,  65  (C 4l\u00adC3e))  and  in  the  treaty  of 263(?)  between  the  Aitolians  and  Akarnanians  (IG ix\u00b2.1 3A.23). According  to  the  Nemean  theorodokoi  list,  Derion  was part  of  Akarnania  (SEG 36  331.A.15 41  ( 331/30\u00ad313)).  At least  in  314  it  was  a  member  of  the  Akarnanian  Confederacy (Diod. 19.67.4;  IG ix\u00b2.13A.23;  cf.  also  the  theorodokoi  lists cited  below).  In C 4l\u00adC3e  Aristarchidas  of  Derion  was appointed  proxenos  by  Epidauros  (no. 348)  for  having  host- ed  theoroi  from  there  (IAEpi 42.61,65).Other  theorodokoi  are attested  in  the  Nemean  List  (SEG 36  331.A.41\u00ad43 ( 331/30\u00ad313)). The  remains  of  the  site  at  Skourtou  have  recently  been described  by  Pritchett  ( 1992)  81\u00ad85,  who  refers  to the acropolis,  a  possible  temple  site  (citing  Woodhouse)  and  the walls,  and  mentions  \"pieces  of  glazed  pottery\"  of  C 5  (ibid. 85).  However,  there  is  a  problem  concerning  the  walls: Diodorus  speaks  of  &lt; &gt;  \u00b5   and of \u00b5    and  mentions  in that  context  ( 19.67.3\u00ad5).  But  &lt; &gt;  is  a  conjecture (by  Reiske  and  Dindorf);  the  MSS  have  ,  and Diodorus  writes  in  general  terms. 358 gehrke  and  wirbelauer 118.

The  toponym  is  ', (I.Magnesia 35.37  Rigsby  ( 1996)  212\u00ad14  no. 85  (c. 207))  or '  (Ps.-Skylax  34).  The  city-ethnic  is  ' (Bacchyl.  fr. 29;Eur.  Cyc. 277;  Arist.  Ithac.  Pol.fr. 511)  or (I.Magnesia 36.4,  27;  this  form  of  the  ethnic  is  also found  on  coins  (infra)  but  is  otherwise  confined t o  poetry and  to Odysseus,  e.g.  Eur.  Cycl. 103). Ithaka  is  attested  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skylax 34  and  in  the  political  sense  by  Eur.  Cyc. 276  (but  in  a  mythical context).  The  earliest  epigraphical  attestation  of  the  political sense  is  in  an  Ithakan  decree  from  Magnesia  (I.Magnesia 36.4, 27  (c. 207)).  Polis  status  in  C 6  may  be  inferred  from  the  cult  of the  goddess  Athena  Polias  (IG ix\u00b2.1  1614  (C 6),  contra  Cole ( 1995)  301\u00ad4.  Ithaka  is  included  among  the  Aristotelian politeiai  (Arist.  frr. 509\u00ad14). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally in  the  Aristotelian  '  (no. 68,  Gigon) and  internally  on  the  coins  (see  infra). The  name  of  the  island  is  '  (Hom.  Il. 2.632;  Od. 1.18).It  is  identical  with  that  of  the  city  and  the  territory  (Ps.- Skylax 34).  The  place  \u00b5  called  '   (Plut.  Mor. 301D)  or      '    (Steph.  Byz. 75.14)  is  commonly  identified w ith  the site  at  the  A\u00ebtos  mountain  (Partsch  ( 1890)  57\u00ad58;  Strauch ( 1996b)),  but  it  seems  to  be  a  mythological  fiction (Wirbelauer  ( 1998)  248\u00ad51).  Other  toponyms  on  Ithaka attested  in  ancient  sources  derive  from  the  Odyssey.The island  is  situated  near  Kephallenia  (Strabo  10.2.11\u00ad12;Steph. Byz. 328.12;  cf.  Strabo  8.2.2). From  the  fact  that  Kephallenian  cities  were  members  of  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League,  Dreher  ( 1995b) 191,  199,  infers  Ithakan  membership  of  the  League  too. The  only  psaphisma  of  Ithaka  known  to  us  is  the  inscrip- tion  from  Magnesia  on  the  Maeander  (I.Magnesia 36.29 (c. 207)). There  was  a  sanctuary  of  Athena  Polias  and  Hera  Teleia (IG ix\u00b2.1  1614  (C 6);  cf.  I.Magnesia 36.30)  and  a  cave  sanctu- ary  at  the  Polis  bay  (Benton  ( 1934\u00ad35),  ( 1938\u00ad39);  Steinhart and  Wirbelauer  ( 2002)  334\u00ad35,  Mycenaean  to  Roman  times) with  dedications,  particularly  to  the  Nymphs  and  to Herakles  and  Odysseus.  The  veneration  of  Athena  and Odysseus  is  also  attested  on  some  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2428 (C 4\u00adC3)).  A  sanctuary  and  temple  of  Apollo  were  situated in  the  saddle  east  of  the  A\u00ebtos  mountain  (Symeonoglou, Prakt  ( 1986)  236\u00ad37,  pl. 104a;  cf.  SEG 38  432  (C 6\u00adC3)  and  IG ix\u00b2.1  1685).The  existence  of  a  stadion  is  to be  concluded  from the  mention  of  the  games  called  Odysseia  in  I.Magnesia 36.16. The  settlement  in  the  saddle  east  of  A\u00ebtos,  presumably  the urban  centre  of  Ithaka,  had  a  fortified acropolis on the sum- mit  of  the  mountain  and  polygonal  city  walls  (C 5\u00adC4; sketch  map:  Heurtley  and  Lorimer  ( 1932\u00ad33)  pl. 1;renewed: Symeonoglou,  Prakt  ( 1985)  202;  cf.  especially  Kilian  ( 1975)) and  several  buildings  (Symeonoglou,  Prakt  ( 1984ff);  Ergon ( 1984ff);  Steinhart  and  Wirbelauer  ( 2002)  331;  Randsborg ( 2002)  1.109,  2.282\u00ad83).  The  city  walls  enclose  an  area  of  c. 12 ha.  A  harbour  ( \u00b5) is recorded by Ps.-Skylax  34.There are  other  remains  of  polygonal  walls  scattered  on  various sites  in  the  northern  part  of  the  island. The  eponym  of  Ithaka  was  Ithakos  (Hom.  Od. 17.207), brother  of  Neritos  and  son  of  Pterelaos  (Akousilaos (FGrHist 2)  fr. 43),  cf.  Wirbelauer  ( 1998)  280\u00ad83. The  patron  deity  of  Ithaka  was  Athena  Polias  (IG ix\u00b2.1 1614  (C 6);  cf.  SEG 27  180;  LSAG \u00b2231  no. 3).  There  was  a  festi- val  called  Odysseia  at  least  in  the  Hellenistic  period (I.Magnesia 36.16). 360 gehrke  and  wirbelauer Ithaka  struck  bronze  coins  from  C 4  to C 2.

The  toponym  is  [ ] (Korinna  col. ii.36,  Campbell), ,  (IG i\u00b3  364.1, 7  ML 61  ( 433/2);  IG iv\u00b2.195.28  ( 356/5))  or  (IG ii\u00b2 5224.2  CEG 469  (C 4f);  Hdt. 7.145.2;  Thuc. 3.70.3).  The name  of  the  island  is  the  same  as  that  of  the  polis  (Ps.-Skylax 29).  The  city-ethnic  is  (F.Delphes iii.4 454  LSAG \u00b2  233  and 234  no. 15  (c. 500\u00ad475);  cf.  SEG 31  546, 547), (IG ii\u00b2  97  ( 375);  on  coins,  cf.  Head,  HN \u00b2 327  (C 4))  or  (Agora xvii  517  (C 5\u00adC4)),which  is the  only  form  attested  in  literary  sources  (Hdt. 7.15.3;  Thuc. 3.70.1). Korkyra  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Thuc. 3.72.3,  74.2;Xen.  Hell. 6.2.17,  24;  Ps.-Skylax 29)  and  in  the political  sense  (Thuc. 1.55.1,  3.70.1;Dem.  24.202).  The  terri- torial  sense  is  a  connotation  at  Thuc. 1.37.3.  The  citizen  of Korkyra  is  called  polites  by Thuc. 3.70.2  and  Xen.  Hell. 6.2.22, and  the  polis  was  included  among  the  Aristotelian  politeiai (fr. 517.1). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally in  different  inscriptions  (e.g.  IG ii\u00b2  97  ( 375))  and  in  Classical authors  (e.g.  Hdt. 7.154.3;  Thuc. 1.32.2),  and  internally  on coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2327  (C 4)).  The  individual  use  of  the  city- ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  Delphi  (CID ii  5.I.2  ( 359/8)) and  Athens  (IG ii\u00b2  9010  (C 4s)).  It  is  called  patris  in  IG ii\u00b2 5224,  an  inscription  which  is  dated  to  c. 375  on  formal grounds;  however,  the  grave  associated  with  the  stele  seems to  date  to  the  third  quarter  of  C 5;  the  stele  was  presumably erected  in  375  when  Korkyra  joined  the  Second  Athenian Naval  Confederacy  (cf.  IG ii\u00b2  96);  see  Knigge  ( 1972)  and ( 1988)  99\u00ad100. The  name  of  the  territory  is  (Thuc. 1.30.1)  or (Strabo  7.75). (Strabo  7  fr. 6)  as  the name  of  the  peraia  around  Buthroton  is  supposed  by B\u00fcrchner  ( 1922)  1401,  1417  (cf.  Thuc. 3.85.2;  Strauch  ( 1997) 227).  The  island  of  Ptychia  mentioned  by  Thuc. 4.46.3 has  been  identified w ith  the  modern  island  of  Vido (B\u00fcrchner  ( 1922)  1411\u00ad12  no. 9;  Dontas  ( 1965)  139\u00ad40  n. 3). The  mountain  '  had  a  /\u00b5  held  by  the oligarchs  in  427\u00ad425  with 600  men  (Thuc. 3.85.4,4.2.3,46.2). On  the  north  coast  of  the  island  lay  a  town  named  Kassiope with  a  port  and  a  temple  of  Zeus  Kasios  (Adler  ( 1919)  2267; B\u00fcrchner  ( 1919),  ( 1922)  1413  no. 13;  Schwabl  ( 1972)  320\u00ad21, see  also  SEG 23  395). The  position  of  Korkyra  was  excellent  for  the  traffic between  Greece  and  Italy  (Thuc. 1.36.2,  44.3;Xen.  Hell. 6.2.9;  cf.  Partsch  ( 1887)  57;  Kiechle  ( 1979);  Thiry  ( 2001) 139\u00ad40). For  the  foundation  of  Korkyra  we have two  different  tra- ditions.  Strabo  6.2.4  says  that  it  was  founded  in  the  same year  as  Syracuse  (no. 47),  i.e.  traditionally  in  733;  Euseb. Chron.  (translated  by  Jerome),  however,  gives  the  year  706, which  better  fits the archaeological e vidence  (cf. Coldstream  ( 1977)  185;  Kalligas  ( 1984);  De  Fidio  ( 1995) 90\u00ad94;  Lang  ( 1996)  301).  The  metropolis  was  Corinth  (no. 227)  (Hdt. 3.49.1;  Thuc. 1.25.3,  38.1;  cf.  Corinth viii.3 23  SEG 28  380  (C 4)),  but  we  hear  also  of  Eretrians  (no. 370)  from  Euboia  as  colonists  before  the  Corinthians  (Plut. Mor. 293AB;  for  a  discussion,  see  Kalligas  ( 1984);  De  Fidio ( 1995)  64\u00ad65;  Parker  ( 1997)  55\u00ad57).  The  oecist  was  the Bacchiad  (Timaios  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 80;  schol.  Ap.  Rhod. 4.1212\u00ad14,  1216)  Chersikrates  from  Corinth  (Strabo  6.2.4). Perhaps  the  inscription  (Klaffenbach  ( 1940)  164\u00ad65  no. 3)  is  related  to  a  cult  for Chersikrates  as  heros  ktistes.  The  mythical  eponym  is Korkyra,  daughter  of  Asopos  (Korinna,  PMG 645  col. iii.21; schol.  Pind.  Ol. 6.144;Diod.  4.72.1;  Paus. 5.22.6). The  foreign  relations  of  Korkyra  are  amply  attested.  The Korkyraians  concluded  an  \u00b5  with  Athens  (no. 361)  in 433  (Thuc. 1.144.1\u00ad2;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 161)  and  an  alliance  in  427 (Thuc. 3.75.1;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 172).  In  375,  Korkyra  became  a member  of  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2 96\u00ad97  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 262\u00ad63;  Dreher  ( 1995a)  13\u00ad14;  contra: Cargill  ( 1981)  68ff)  and,  in  340  or  later,  a member  of  the Hellenic  League  against  Philip  II  (Dem. 18.237;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 343;  cf.  CEG ii  809).  For  C 4  (C 3:  Parke),  a  sympoliteia  with  the Orikioi  (no. 103)  is  attested  (Parke  ( 1967)  261  no. 6  SEG 23 474;  for  further  information,  see  Strauch  ( 1997)  227  n. 72). The  Korkyraians  were  involved  in  the  following  wars  and engagements.  In C 7  ( 664?),  Korkyra  and  Corinth  (no. 227) fought  the  first naval battle in G reek  history,  as  far  as Thucydides  knew  ( 1.13.4).  About  600,  the  Arniad  Charops (not  Arniadas,  cf.  SEG 36  541)  was  killed  in  a  naval  campaign Attic  inscriptions  of  C 5/C4  use  both  forms  ( ..., .  .  .),  while  in Hellenistic  and  Roman  times  .  .  .  is  preferred.  Outside  Attika,  the  epi- graphical  evidence  usually  has  ...(exception:  SEG 31  548\u00ad50  (Delphi, C 5\u00adC3),  but  cf.  the  note  of  the  SEG  editor  on  Vatin's  readings;  SEG 25  354 (Sikyon,  n.  d.)).  Therefore,  editors  (at  least  those  of  non-Attic  inscriptions) should  avoid  restoring  ...without  special  arguments  (e.g.  in  I.Didyma 214A.ii.11  (C 1),  the  restoration  [ ]  seems  preferable),  cf.  now  Hallof in  IG ix\u00b2.14  p. 1. akarnania  and  adjacent  areas  361 on  the  river  Arachthus  (CEG i145;  Hammond  ( 1967)  493; Andreou  ( 1991)  436\u00ad38).  Before  the  Persian  wars,  the Korkyraian  fleet was among the best in G reece  (Thuc. 1.14.2; Kiechle  ( 1979)  175).  Sixty  ships  were  sent  to  Salamis,  but remained  in  western  waters  (Hdt. 7.168.3).  Before  the Peloponnesian  War,  the  Korkyraian  navy  was  the  second largest  in  Hellas,  surpassed  only  by  the  Athenian  (Thuc. 1.33.1).  Korkyra  could  muster  110  ships  against  the Corinthians,  of  which  about  seventy  were  lost  in  the  battle of  Sybota  (in  433,  Thuc. 1.47.1,  54.2).  In  373/2,  the  Spartans under  Mnasippos  besieged  Korkyra  without  success  (Xen. Hell. 6.2.3\u00ad26).  In  345/4,  two  Korkyraian  ships  joined Timoleon  (Plut.  Tim. 8.5).  Three  strategoi  (Mikiades, Aisimides  and  Eurybatos)  are  attested  as  commanding  the fleet in  433  (Thuc. 1.47.1,  48.3). Korkyraian  envoys  were sent  to Athens  in  433  (Thuc. 1.31.2\u00ad44),  in  427  (Thuc. 3.71.2)  and  in  375  (IG ii\u00b2  96).  The envoys  Thersandros  and  Simylos  died  in  Athens  (IG ii\u00b2 5224  CEG ii  469  (C 4f,  r 433/2?);  cf.  Knigge  ( 1988)  99\u00ad100). Before  the  Hellenistic  period,  Korkyra  gave  proxenia  to Menekrates  of  Oiantheia  (no. 166)  (CEG i143  ( 625\u00ad600?); but  cf.  SEG 44  441  and  Nomima i34  (c. 550))  and  to  some Corinthians  (Thuc. 3.70.1),  and  Korkyraians  were  granted proxenia  in  Delphi  (no. 177)  (SEG 31  534  (C 4);  F.Delphes iii.4 406.2\u00ad4  (C 4\u00adC3);  for  proxenoi  of  Delphi,  cf.  Empereur ( 1981)  418). Theorodokoi  were  appointed  in  Korkyra  to  host  theoroi from  Argos  (no. 347)  (SEG 23  189.i.13  ( 330\u00ad324);  cf.  Cabanes ( 1969)  551;  SEG 26  427  and 36  337),  Delphi  (no. 177) (F.Delphes iii.4406.2\u00ad4  (C 4\u00adC3)),  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.195.28  ( 356/5))  and  Nemea  (SEG 36  331.B.6\u00ad7 ( 331/30\u00ad313)). Several  Korkyraian  Olympionikai  are  attested  ( 111,  118, 155(?),  161,  168,  409?  (C 6\u00adC4)).  The  famous  bronze  bull  in Delphi  was  a  communal  dedication  of  the  Korkyraians (Paus. 10.9.3\u00ad4;  F.Delphes iii.12  (c. 480);  cf.  LSAG \u00b2113  no. 13; F.Delphes iii.4  454  LSAG \u00b2  233  and 234  no. 15  (c. 500\u00ad475); cf.  Bommelaer  ( 1991)  103\u00ad4  no. 104;  Jacquemin  ( 1999)  64\u00ad65, 320  no. 122).  Another  bronze  bull  was  dedicated  at  Olympia (Paus. 5.27.9). In C 7\u00adC6,  Korkyra  was  under  the  rule  of  the  Corinthian tyrant  Periander  (Hdt. 3.52.6).  During  the  Archidamian War,  there  was  a  stasis  between  democrats  and  oligarchs (Thuc. 3.70\u00ad85;Diod.  12.57,  13.48;  cf.  Gehrke,  Stasis 88\u00ad93). Thereafter,  Korkyra was  democratic  (for  375,see IG ii\u00b2 96  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 262;  IG ii\u00b2  97  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 263),  but suffered  from  civil  strife  several  times:  in  411/10  (Diod. 13.48.5ff),  in  375/4  (Diod. 15.46.2,  47.1)  and  in  361,  when  the oligarchs  came  to  power  once  again  (Aen.  Tact. 11.15). The  oldest  public  enactment  (C 7)  is  attested  indirectly  by proxeny  given  by the  damos  to  Menekrates  of  Oiantheia  (no. 166)  (CEG i143.3).Nomoi  are  mentioned  by  Xen.  Hell. 5.4.64, 375.  A  law  court  can  be  inferred  from  Thuc. 3.70.3.The eponymous  magistrate  was  a  prytanis  (IG ix\u00b2.1786.1  (C 4)), together  with  whom  synarchoi  are  mentioned  (Klaffenbach ( 1940)  163  no. 1  (C 4)).  A  boule  and  bouleutai  are  attested  by Thuc. 3.70.5\u00ad6.  Explicitly,  the  term  halia  does  not  occur  earlier  than  in  Hellenistic  inscriptions  (e.g.  IG ix\u00b2.1786.5 (C 4)).  But  since  we  know  of  decisions  of  the  Korkyraian people  before  that  date  (CEG i143.3,  5\u00ad6;  Thuc. 3.71.2),  we have to conclude  that  the  halia  had  existed  since  the  Archaic period. From  inscribed  lead  tablets  found  at  Palaiopolis  (c. 500) we are  informed  about  the  Korkyraian  system  of  civic  sub- divisions  (Kalligas  ( 1971);  cf.  Jones,  POAG 159\u00ad61;  Hadzis ( 1993);  Nomima ii  73),a  combination  of  proper  names  given in  gen.  pl./sing.  with  a  feminine  ordinal  adjective.A  different kind  of  civic  subdivision  is  attested  in  the  form  of  a  sub- ethnic  on  the  back  of  one  of  the  tablets:  \u00b5 (SEG  41  543).  Two  members  of  the  Dorian  phyle Hylleis  are  recorded  in  IG ix\u00b2.1798.3,  5  (C 2);  cf.  SEG 25  609; Kalligas  ( 1971)  87). The  acropolis  (Thuc. 3.72.3)  was  situated  in  the  southern part  of  the  city  (B\u00fcrchner  ( 1922)  1411).A  with is  mentioned  by  Xen.  Hell. 6.2.15,  17,  20  ( 373/2).  Whether  the remains  of  a  wall  with  gates  and  towers  between  the  ports  of Hyllos  and  Alkinoos  can  be  identified w ith  Xenophon's is  a  matter  of  discussion;  for:  Schmidt  ( 1890)  46  and pl.  II;  Spetsieris-Choremis  ( 1997)  12  (C 5\u00adC4);  against: Kaletsch  in  Lauffer  ( 1989)  503,  who  dates  this  wall  to  the Hellenistic  period.  Archaeological  evidence  for  the  urban structure  is  reported  by  Lang  ( 1996)  299\u00ad301. The  most  important  public  buildings  were  the  bouleuteri- on  (Thuc. 3.70.6:   ) and the prytaneion (I.Magnesia 44.40,  42  (c. 207)).  The  agora,  where  in  C 5  most of  the  oligarchs  lived  (Thuc. 3.72.3),  was  situated  in  the northern  part  of  the  city  near  the  northern  harbour  (Thuc. 3.72.3,  74.2). A is  attested  by  Thuc. 3.74.2  (cf. :  SEG 13 384.10,  11  (C 2)),  who  likewise  mentions  two  Korkyraian ports  ( 3.72.3),  the  `  ( `,  Apoll.  Rhod. 4.1125)  or  (schol.  Dionys.  Per. 493  GGM ii.450) \u00b5,and the \u00b5     [sc.    ]    (commonly  identified w ith  the   \u00b5,schol.Dionys.Per.493).Xen.Hell.6.2.36  has  only  one \u00b5  .  According  to  Ps.-Skylax  29, 362 gehrke  and  wirbelauer Korkyra  had  three  good  harbours  near  the  city,  but  the  iden- tification of  the  third  remains  doubtful. The  patron  deity  of  Korkyra  was  Apollo  Korkyraios (Kalligas  ( 1968)  313  LSAG \u00b2  453  no.  A  (C 5)).  On  his  cult,  see also  Kalligas  ( 1969a)  54\u00ad58;(1968)  304\u00ad13  (C 6  and  later). Sanctuaries  for  the  following  deities  are  attested:  Artemis (Rodenwaldt  ( 1939);  Schleif  et al.( 1940);  Riemann  ( 1943) (C 6);  votive  inscriptions:  Klaffenbach  ( 1940)  163\u00ad64  no. 1 (C 4);  no. 2  (C 3));Apollo  Pythios  (Klaffenbach  ( 1940)  165\u00ad66 no. 5  LSAG \u00b2234  no. 17  (C 5));  Hera  Akr(a)ia  (IG ix.1 698  LSAG \u00b2234  no. 18  (C 5),  identified b y  Dontas  ( 1965), ( 1976),  and  Kalligas  ( 1969a)  51,  53,  with  one  of  the  three  tem- ples  known  in  the  Mon  Repos  area;  for  the  Heraion  near  the polis,  see  Thuc. 3.81.2);  the  Dioskouroi  (Thuc. 3.75.3;for a horos found  near  the  Menekrates  monument, see  IG ix\u00b2.1883.ii  (C 4));  Dionysos  (Thuc. 3.81.5;  for  traces  of a  possible  cult  place,  see  Cremer  ( 1981);  Lang  ( 1996) 299\u00ad300).  There  was  a  temenos  of  Zeus  (Thuc. 3.70.4;  for  the cults  of  Zeus  in  Korkyra,  see  Schwabl  ( 1972)  336  no. 9  ( 337); ( 1978)  1477)  and  one  of  the  heros  Alkinoos  (Thuc. 3.70.4). Outside  the  city,  a  temple  of  Zeus  Kasios  existed  in  Kassiope (see  supra)  and  one  of  Artemis  in  the  southern  part  of  the Kanopi  peninsula  (Lang  ( 1996)  299  no. 540). The  Korkyraians  used  the  Dorian  calendar  of  Corinth (no. 227)  (Bischoff  ( 1919)  1592  no. 31;  Hadzis  ( 1995)).  The oracle  of  Dodona  was  consulted  by the  Korkyraians  in  C 5 (Parke  ( 1967)  260  nos. 2,  3),  and  in  C 4  (C 3:  Parke)  together with  the  Orikioi  (no. 103)  (ibid. 261  no. 6  SEG 23  474).  In Delphi,  Korkyra  held  the  promanteia  (F.Delphes iii.4389 (C 4);  cf.  Vatin  ( 1981)  445;  SEG 31  555). In  about  627,  Epidamnos  (no. 79)  was  founded  by Korkyraians  together  with  Corinthian  and  other  Dorian settlers  (Thuc. 1.24.2;Diod.  12.30.2;  cf.  Gomme  ( 1945\u00ad81) i. 159;Gehrke,  Stasis 60\u00ad61  n. 4).  According  to  Strabo  7.5.8,  Apollonia  (no. 77)  was  a  \u00b5   ,  and  Korkyra  participated  probably  in  the  colonisation  of  Leukas  (no. 126;  together  with  Corinth  (no. 227),  Plut.  Them. 24.1,  from  Theophrastos;  Frost  ( 1980) 201\u00ad2). Anaktorion  (no. 114)  is  recorded  as  a  place  common  to Korkyraians  and  Corinthians  before  432  (Thuc. 1.55.1),  which may  suggest  that  it  was  a  shared  foundation  too  (but  see  supra 356).  Kiechle  ( 1979)  179  supports  the  hypothesis  that  Korkyra was  involved  in  the  colonisation  of  the  Dalmatian  island  of Melaina  Korkyra  (no. 83)  carried  out  by  the  Knidians  (no. 903). During  C 6\u00adC4,  Korkyra struck  coins  (silver  and  bronze) following  local  tradition  in  both  standard  and  design.  Silver denominations:  stater,  drachm,  triobol,  diobol,  obol.  Types: obv.  often  cow  (suckling  calf)  or  amphora;  rev.  often  stellate or  floral pattern;  legend:  the  Archaic  coins  are  anepigraphic, but  from  about  450  onward,  they  are  generally  inscribed .After 338,  Korkyra  began  to  strike  staters  similar  to  those  of  Corinth  but  with  the  legends  , or .  A  few  have  been  found  in  hoards from  Sicily  and  Magna  Graecia  (Talbert  ( 1971)  61;  Taliercio Mensitieri  and  Spagnoli  ( 1993)  especially  pls. 3,  5h).  IG i\u00b3 383.91\u00ad93  ( 429/8)  mentions  Korkyraioi  stateres  (cf.  Regling ( 1929)  2175).

The  toponym  is  ,   (Thuc. 2.102.1)  or  ,  (IG iv\u00b2.195.12  ( 356/5);  SEG 36  331.A.49  ( 331/30\u00ad313)).  The  city\u00adethnic  is   (IG ix\u00b2.1583.6  ( 216),  582.2  (c. 207)). Koronta  is  not  explicitly  attested  as  a  polis  but  named together  with  Stratos  (no. 138)       (sc.of Akarnania)  by  Thuc. 2.102.1.  Since  it  was  a  member  of  the Akarnanian  Confederacy,  struck  coins  in  C 4\u00adC3  and  had  a walled  urban  centre  (with  the  highest  degree  of  probability the  site  near  modern  Chrysovitsa:  Pritchett  ( 1992)  102\u00ad3; Schoch  ( 1997)  43\u00ad44),  it  is  to  be  classified as a polis  of  type B. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  abbreviated  form  ( (infra)  or  on  coins  (see  s.v. Torybeia  (no. 140)).  The  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  externally  in  Hellenistic  inscriptions  (see  supra). Koronta  was  part  of  Akarnania  (IG iv\u00b2.195.8  12  ( 356/5); SEG 36  331.A.15 49  ( 331/30\u00ad313)),  lying  in  the  mesogeia (Thuc. 2.102.1).  From  the  account  of  Thucydides  (especially 2.102.1)  we  have  to  conclude  that  Koronta  belonged  to  the Akarnanian  Confederacy  already  in  C 5.It  is  explicitly  attest- ed  as  a  member  in  C 3  (IG ix\u00b2.1583,  582). In 429,a  group  of  citizens  loyal  to  the  Peloponnesians  was exiled  by  the  Athenians  (Thuc. 2.102.1). Theorodokoi  are  attested  in  Koronta  to  host  theoroi  from Epidauros  (no. 348;  IG iv\u00b2.195.12  ( 356/5))  and  Nemea  (SEG 36  331.A.49\u00ad51  ( 331/30\u00ad313)). The  walls  of  the  presumed  site  of  Koronta  near Chrysovitsa  were built  of  polygonal  and  horizontal  mason- ry  (Pritchett  ( 1992)  103  with  pls. 77\u00ad81).  Kirsten  dated  them to  the  Hellenistic  period  (Philippson  and  Kirsten  ( 1958)  635 n. 15),  but  given  the  well-founded  general  observations  by Pritchett  (( 1992)  115ff),  an  earlier  date  seems  preferable. akarnania  and  adjacent  areas  363 A  Pegasos-type  stater  of  Corinthian  standard  has  been attributed  to  Koronta.  Obv.  Pegasos;  rev.  head  of  Athena with  Makedonian  shield;  legend:  K  (Imhoof-Blumer  ( 1878) 114;Head,  HN \u00b2329).  Since  then,  eight  coins  of  this  type  have been  found  in  Sicilian  and  South  Italian  hoards  (Talbert ( 1971)  61;  IGCH 88,  2030,  2180,  2185,  2187,  2198;  Taliercio Mensitieri  and  Spagnoli  ( 1993)  especially  pls. 1,  3);  this coinage  can  be  dated  to  C 4s.

The  city-ethnic  is  (ArchDelt 22B.2  ( 1967)  321;  BE  ( 1970)  343  (C 3s);  cf.  Antonetti  ( 1987) 100\u00ad1;  Strauch  ( 1996a)  282\u00ad83,  319;  but  the  connection  with the  Akarnanian  Euripos  is  not  beyond  doubt;  there  are  also inscriptions  relating  to  other  euripoi/Euripoi,  e.g.  SEG 3415). Euripos  is  presumably  to  be  located  west  of  the  site Saradiniko  on  the  west  bank  of  the  river  Nissis  near  Loutraki (described  by  Pritchett  ( 1994)  192\u00ad95).  Pritchett  ( 1992) 90\u00ad92  locates  Euripos  on  the  Bay  of  Rouga,  but  for  the  connection  of  that  site  with  the  harbour  of  Thyrreion,  see above  Echinos  (no. 118);  cf.  Kirsten  ( 1941a)  108  n. 3; Schwandner  in  AA  ( 1991)  614.  Euripos  is  not  attested  as  a polis  in  the  sources,  but  from  the  passage  of  Ps.-Skylax (supra)  and,  particularly,  from  the  theorodokoi  lists  concern- ing  Akarnania  (see  infra),  we  have  to  infer  that  it  was  a  mem- ber  of  the  Akarnanian  Confederacy.  Since  remains  of  a Classical  and  Hellenistic  urban  settlement  with  a  cemetery exist  west  of  the  above-mentioned  Late  Hellenistic/Roman site  of  Saradiniko  (information  from  E.-L.  Schwandner), Euripos  was  probably  a  polis,  at  least  from  C 4. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally in  a  C 3s  building  inscription  at  Makryada  (ArchDelt 22B.2 ( 1967),  but  see  supra). Euripian  theorodokoi  hosted  theoroi  from  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.195.15  ( 356/5);  cf.  SEG 35  306)  and  from  Nemea (SEG 36  331.A.28\u00ad30  ( 331/30\u00ad313)).  The  Pegasos-type  staters with  an  assigned  to  Echinos  (no. 118)  may  have  been  coins of  Euripos  as  well. 120. ", "Same": "Identifier: 137. , (Samaios) Map  54.  Lat. 38.15,long.  20.40.

Same  was  situated  in  the  northern  and  north-eastern  part of  Kephallenia  (cf.  Thuc. 2.30.2).  In  the  northern  peninsula today  called  Erisos,  in  the  Pylaros  valley,  there  are  some remains  of  settlements  and  fortified places,  e.g.  a  small fortress  of  polygonal  masonry  at  Pyrgos  (C 5\u00adC3;  Partsch ( 1890)  64\u00ad65;  Steinhart  and  Wirbelauer  ( 2002)  194  pl. 78;for a  survey,  see  Randsborg  ( 2002)  i. 53\u00ad60;  ii. 54\u00ad59).  There  are foundations  of  a  temple  outside  the  polis  on  the  top  of  the hill  Alpovuni  (Partsch  ( 1890)  72  and  pl. 2;  Randsborg  ( 1995) 96  and  ( 2002)  ii. 58).

Partsch  ( 1890)  59\u00ad72  gives  a  description of  their  wall  circuit  and  of  the  walls  joining  them.  The remains  are  of  polygonal  and  rectangular  masonry  (C 4?, certainly  C 3;  Randsborg  ( 2002)  i. 43\u00ad52;  ii. 57\u00ad58,  264\u00ad75).

The  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in an  honorific decree from Delphi ( F.Delphes iii.3204.3 ( 162/1?)). The  name  of  the  territory  is  given  by  Thuc. 2.33.3  as    .  It  included  the  southern  part  of  the  island  of Kephallenia  without  the  peninsula  to  the  west  (cf.  Paleis  (no. 132)). The  eponym of  the  island  was  the  hero  Kephalos,  son  of Deion(eus)  and  father  of  Pronos,  Samos,  Peleus  and Kranios,  the  eponyms  of  the  four  Kephallenian  poleis (Gehrke  ( 1994)  110\u00ad12;  Wirbelauer  ( 1998)  269\u00ad80). In 431,  an  Athenian  envoy  was  sent  to  Kephallenia  to ascertain  the  Kephallenian  views  on  the  growing  conflict (Thuc. 2.7.3;Diod.  12.43.5).  The  Corinthian  aggression  in the  winter  of 431/30  (Thuc. 2.33.3)  indicates  that  Kranioi  was pro-Athenian;  its  inhabitants  may  have  been  among  the Kephallenians  who  supplied  ships  to  the  Athenians  under Demosthenes  during  the  campaign  in  426  (Thuc. 3.94\u00ad98) and  hoplites  in  413  (Thuc. 7.31.2).  In  421  the  Athenians  set- tled  Messenians  and  other  people  from  the  Peloponnesos  in Kranioi  (Thuc. 5.35.7).They  were expelled  by the  Spartans  in 401  (Diod. 14.34.2\u00ad3).  In  373/2  the  Kranioi  may  have  been among  the  Kephallenians  who  became  members  of  the Second  Athenian  Naval  League  (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 262  and 267  Agora xvi  46;Xen.  Hell. 6.2.33,  37;  cf.  Dreher  ( 1995b) 191,  199)  and  of  the  Corinthian  League  of 338/7 (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 403).  The  Argive  theorodokoi  list  SEG 23 189.i.20  ( 330\u00ad324)  mentions  Kephallenia;  so  at  least  one  of the  four  Kephallenian  poleis  appointed  theorodokoi  to  host theoroi  from  Argos  (no. 347). Archontes  as  judges  in  one  city  of  Kephallenia  (probably Kranioi  or  Paleis  (no. 132):  Wirbelauer  ( 1998)  341\u00ad42)  are attested  by  Dem. 32.9;  cf. 14,  22\u00ad23. A  sanctuary  of  Demeter  and  Kore  is  mentioned  in  a  late inscription  (Kalligas  ( 1978);  SEG 30  517  (C 1)).  Whether  the foundations  with  orthostats  on  the  acropolis  belong  to  this temple  or  to  another  one  has  to  remain  open  (cf.  Kalligas ( 1969b)  270\u00ad72).  A  rural  sanctuary  of  C 6  was  discovered  at Minies;  its  remains  are  now  covered  or  destroyed  by  the modern  airport  (Kalligas  ( 1973)  83\u00ad84;  Randsborg  ( 1995) 97). The  acropolis  is  situated  on  the  top  of  the  hill  in  the south-western  part  of  the  settlement  (Kalligas  ( 1969b) 270\u00ad72).  Polygonal  and  ashlar  walls  exist  on  three  sides  of the  town,  and  there  are  two  other  stretches  connecting  the main  wall  with  the  plain  of  K\u00fatavos,  probably  the  ancient harbour  of  Kranioi  (for  Mycenaean  remains  and  those  of C 5\u00adC4,  see  Partsch  ( 1890)  80\u00ad84  with  pl. 2;  Benton  ( 1932) 224\u00ad25;  Kalligas  ( 1969b)  272,(1978)  137;  Steinhart  and Wirbelauer  ( 2002)  333;  Randsborg  ( 2002)  i. 106\u00ad8,  ii. 275\u00ad81, 299\u00ad307).

Byz. 281.10\u00ad11,  the  original  toponym  was  ', probably  a  construct  by  Hellenistic  authors  (Freitag  ( 1994) 22).

The  earliest  attestation  of  the political  sense  is  in  a  C 3  decree  (IG ix\u00b2.13B.7\u00ad8).  The  word is  used  by Diod. 18.8.6  (r  c. 325/4;  see  Jehne  ( 1994) 241\u00ad43). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally by Thuc. 2.82  and 3.94.1  as  well  as  in  an  inscription  concern- ing  a  boundary  dispute  (IG ix\u00b2.13B.3\u00ad4,7\u00ad8  (C 3  before  230)) akarnania  and  adjacent  areas  367 and  internally  on  C 3  coins  (infra)  and  on  a  stamped  tile (SEG 42  486  (C 3\u00adC2)). The  territory is  called  (IG ix\u00b2.13B.3\u00ad4  (C 3);  Polyb. 21.32.14)  or       (Thuc. 2.102.6)  or  (schol.  Thuc. 2.102).  It  was  situated  in  south-western Akarnania,  at  a  distance  of  about  70  stades  from  the  mouth of  the  river  Acheloos  (Strabo  10.2.2).  It  is  attested  as  part  of Akarnania  in  the  theorodokoi  lists  (see  infra).  To  the  north, Oiniadai  bordered  on  the  territory  of  *Matropolis  (no. 128) (IG ix\u00b2.13B). The  Argive hero  Alkmaion  passes  for  the  founder  of Oiniadai,  while  his  son  Akarnan  gave  his  name  to  the  whole region  (Thuc. 2.102.5\u00ad6;  Jouan  ( 1990);  Gehrke  ( 1994\u00ad95) 46\u00ad48). Messenians  from  Naupaktos  (no. 165)  attacked  Oiniadai in 456/5  and  forced  its  population  to  leave  their  town,  but  in the  next  year  the  Oiniadai  returned  (Paus. 4.25.3).  In  325/4 (Jehne  ( 1994)  241\u00ad43),  the  Oiniadai  were  driven  out  by  the Aitolians  (Diod. 18.8.6;Plut.  Alex. 49.8).  On  Kassander's advice  the  Oiniadai  left  their  settlement  in  314  and  moved  to Sauria  (Diod. 19.67.4;cf.Freitag  ( 1994)  222\u00ad23).Strabo  10.2.2 mentions  an  old  Oiniadai  at  a  greater  distance  from  the  sea; the  matter  remains  a  mystery  (for  a  discussion,  see  Freitag ( 1994)  226\u00ad27). According  to  Freitag  ( 1994)  236  with  n. 97,  Oiniadai  did not  become  a  member  of  the  Akarnanian  Confederacy  until 424,  when  the  polis  was  forced  to  join  the  Athenian  League (Thuc. 4.77.2;  Kagan  ( 1974)  281).  In  the  years  before, Oiniadai  had  supported  the  Lakedaimonians  against  the Akarnanians  and  Athenians  (Thuc. 2.82).In  263(?),Oiniadai is  attested  as  part  of  the  Akarnanian  koinon  (IG ix\u00b2.13A.22). Oiniadai  appointed  theorodokoi  to  host  theoroi  from Epidauros  (no. 348;  IG iv\u00b2.195.9  ( 356/5))  and  Nemea  (SEG 36  331.A.34\u00ad7  ( 331/30\u00ad313)). An  acropolis  ( ) is attested by Polyb.  4.65.5\u00ad11  (r 219). Remains  of  an  edifice c onsisting  of  a  complex  of  thirteen rooms  on  a  hill-top  near  the  acropolis  may  have  been  a dwelling  house  (cf.  Powell  ( 1904)  214).The  existence  of  a  city wall  in  the  450s  is  indicated  by  Thucydides'  reference  to  a poliorkia  by  the  Athenians  ( 1.111.3;  cf.  Paus. 4.25.2  claiming that  in  456/5  the  Messenians  of  Naupaktos  (no. 165)  tried  to take  Oiniadai  using  scaling  ladders  and  \u00b5\u00b5); Plutarch  mentions  a  wall  of  Oiniadai  at  the  time  of  the Periklean  expedition  to  Akarnania  (Plut.  Per. 19.3);  in  219, Philip  V  fortified Oiniadai (again?;  Polyb. 4.65.5ff).  There are  substantial  remains  of  a  regular  polygonal  wall  over  6  km in  length  (described  by  Powell  ( 1904)  146ff  and  Kirsten ( 1937)  2215ff).It  enclosed  the  acropolis  and  the  lower  city,  an area  of  altogether  59  ha,  and  may  date  from  C 5\u00adC4  (Winter ( 1971)  236;  Pritchett  ( 1992)  117\u00ad18,  against  Kirsten  ( 1937) 2224,  who  argued  that  only  the  acropolis  had  been  enclosed by  a  wall  until  Philip  V  fortified Oiniadai in  219).  Inside  the circuit,  few  remains  of  streets  and  houses  are  discernible  (cf. the  plan  by Kirsten  ( 1937)  2217\u00ad18).  The  results  of  recent archaeological  investigations  have  been  published  by Kolonas,  Serbetis  and  Schmidt  ( 1992). There  are  remains  of  a  small  temple  on  the  western  side  of the  harbour  of  Oiniadai,  where  a  fragment  of  a  foot  from  a statue  has  been  found.  Powell  ( 1904)  205  suggests  that  it might  have  been  Athena  the  Saviour,  who  was  worshipped as  the  goddess  of  the  sailors  in  the  Piraeus. The  evidence  for  silver  coins  remains  doubtful  (Head, HN \u00b2  331).  Bronze  coins  of  C 3  have  the  legend   (Imhoof-Blumer  ( 1878)  15\u00ad17,  151;  Grose  ( 1926)  5372\u00ad9; IGCH 145,  311\u00ad12;  SNG  Cop.  Acarnania 400\u00ad3). 131.

Sollion  is  called  both  a  polisma  and  a  polis  in  the urban  sense  at  Thuc. 2.30.1.At 3.95.1  and 5.30.2  Thucydides uses  the  toponym  without  any  site-classification. Thucydides  describes  Sollion  as   \u00b5 ( 2.30.1),which  indicates  that  Sollion  was  a  colony  of  Corinth (no. 227)  (Graham  ( 1962),  ( 1964)  118\u00ad19),  pace  Salmon ( 1984)  277\u00ad78,  who  overlooked  that  Thuc. 2.30.1  uses  polis synonymously  with  polisma.  However,  the  colony  was  not an  independent  community,  for  at  Thuc. 5.30.2  we  are  told that  the  Athenians  had  not  complied  with  the  terms  of  the Peace  of  Nikias  and  surrendered  Sollion  to  the  Corinthians. The  inference  is  that  Sollion  was  a  dependent  polis,  a colony that  to some  extent  was  under  Corinthian  supremacy (Graham  ( 1964)  118\u00ad42).  Sollion  was  conquered  by  the Athenians  in  431/0  and  handed  over  to  the  polis  of  Palairos (no. 131),  Thuc. 2.30.1: ... ...   \u00b5        \u00b5     \u00b5.  The  presumption  is  that  Sollion  thereafter  was the  harbour  of  Palairos  (Thuc. 3.95.1)  and  had  ceased  to  be  a polis. Perhaps  other  Samaioi  are  mentioned  in  Greek  inscriptions,  but  sometimes the  distinction  between  the  various  cities  or  ethnics  beginning  with  \u00b5- is impossible. akarnania  and  adjacent  areas  371 The  exact  location  is  unknown  (cf.

Lat. 38.40,long.  21.20.  Size of  territory: 2.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is  (Thuc. 2.80.8;  IG iv\u00b2.195.10  ( 356/5)),  (Polyb. 5.13.10),  or  (Paus. 6.2.1).  The  city-ethnic  is  (Thuc. 2.81.2;  IG ix\u00b2.1 390.1\u00ad2  (C 5);  CID ii  1.ii.17,22  ( 362/1);  cf. ,IG  ix\u00b2.1 3A.25  ( 263?)). Stratos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Thuc. 2.81.2, 4\u00ad5,  2.102.2,  3.106.1.  The  territorial  sense  is  a  connotation  at Thuc. 2.80.8.  The  political  sense  is  attested  in  a  C 5  proxeny decree  of  Stratos  (IG ix\u00b2.1  390.1\u00ad2).  The  collective use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  the  Delphic  contribution list  CID ii  1.ii.17  ( 362/1)  and  by  Thucydides  (see  supra),  and internally  in  the  proxeny  decree  mentioned  above  as  well  as on  the  coins  (see  infra).  The  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic is  attested  externally  in  CID ii  1.ii.22  ( 362/1),  and  internally in  a  manumission  inscription  (IG ix\u00b2.1394.4,  10  (C 2)). Stratos  was  part  of  Akarnania  (IG iv\u00b2.195.8 10  ( 356/5); SEG 36  331.A.15 38  ( 331/0\u00ad313);  Strabo  10.2.2),  lying  in  the interior  (Thuc. 2.102.1;Strabo 10.2.3)  beside  the  river  Acheloos (Polyb. 5.6.6)  as   \u00b5    (Thuc. 2.80.8).  Its  territory  is  called     (Thuc. 3.106.2). The of  the  Aitolian  Confederacy  included at  least,  besides  Stratos  itself,  the  poleis  of  Oiniadai  (no. 130) and  Matropolis  (no. 128)  (IG ix\u00b2.13B.2  (C 3  before  230)). Stratos  was  a  member  of  the  Akarnanian  Confederacy and  the  seat  of  the  federal  institutions  (Xen.  Hell. 4.6.4 (r 389);  IG ix\u00b2.1393  (C 3)).  Klaffenbach  ( 1957a)  xiv  suggests that  the  central  position  of  Stratos  in  the  Confederacy-- attested  by  Xen.  Hell. 4.6.4)--may be t raced  back  to  424. During  the  Peloponnesian  War  (in  429),  citizens  loyal  to the  Peloponnesians  suffered  expulsion  by  the  Athenians (Thuc. 2.102.1).  In  314,  on  the  advice of  Cassander,  many Akarnanians  moved  to  Stratos  (Diod. 19.67.4;  see  Freitag ( 1994)  222\u00ad23  for  the  historical  circumstances). Stratos  honoured  Lysias  from  Megara  (no. 225)  and  his two  sons  with  proxenia  (IG ix\u00b2.1  390  (C 5))  and  appointed theorodokoi  to  host  theoroi  from  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.195.10  ( 356/5))  and  Nemea  (SEG 36  331.A.38\u00ad40,B.38\u00ad40 ( 331/30\u00ad313)).  A  Stratian  Olympic  winner  with  unknown name  is  attested  for  368  (Olympionikai 416(?)).  He  was  hon- oured  with  a  statue  by  Lysippos  (Paus. 6.2.1). The  oldest  attested  public  enactment  is  the  proxeny decree  of  C 5  (IG ix\u00b2.1  390),which  mentions  a  bolarchos  from Phoitiai  (no. 134)  (ibid. 390.9). To  the  west  of  the  middle  hill  lay  the  agora  of  Stratos,  with large  stoai,a bouleuterion  and  a  great  altar,  all  of  C 4 (Schwandner,  AA  ( 1991)  614,(1992)  669,(1993)  678,(1995) 783,(1996)  555\u00ad56  with  pls. 2\u00ad3,(1997)  509\u00ad10;  Lang  ( 1994) 243).  The  ruins  of  the  Doric  temple  of  Zeus  (C 4;  cf.  IG ix\u00b2.1 394.4,18  (suppl.,  C 2),and  IG ix\u00b2.1  395  (C 4,perhaps  a  list  with contributions  to  the  temple  building))  have  been  studied  by Picard  and  Courby  (( 1924);  cf.  Zschietzschmann  ( 1931) 334\u00ad35;Wurster ( 1973)  209\u00ad10;  Bankel  ( 1984)).  At  a  distance of  about  4  km  to  the  west  of  Stratos  (site  of  Spathari), remains  of  an  Archaic  temple  (C 6,  with  Hellenistic  restora- tions  and,  probably,  a Geometric  predecessor)  have recently been  excavated  (Schwandner  ( 1994),  AA  ( 1995)  784\u00ad86, ( 1996)  557\u00ad58).  Midway  between  this  temple  and  the  city, another  extra-urban  sanctuary  existed,  which  was  discov- ered  in  1993  (Schwandner,  AA  ( 1995)  783\u00ad84).The  C 4  theatre of  Stratos  (now  excavated:  Schwandner,  AA  ( 1993)  678, ( 1996)  555\u00ad56,(1997)  509;  TGR  ii: 302)  accommodated c. 8,000  spectators  (Lang  ( 1994)  243). The  acropolis  of  Stratos  was  situated  on  the  northern edge  of  the  city.  The  circuit  of  walls  (Pritchett  ( 1989)  137\u00ad39) built  of  pseudo-isodomic  masonry  and  surrounding  both the  fortified acropolis and the t own  was  about  7.5  km  long and  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 80  ha.  According  to  Thuc. 2.81.2, Stratos  was  a  walled  city  in  429,  which  suggests  (pace  Winter ( 1971)  112  n. 26)  that  the  existing  enceinte  dates  from  at  least C 5  (Pritchett  ( 1992)  115\u00ad16;  Gehrke  ( 1994\u00ad95)  44\u00ad45);  at present  archaeology  dates  the  fortification t o  C 4l (Schwander  and  Kolonas  ( 1996)). Stratos  struck  silver  coins  c. 450\u00ad400.  Denominations: pentobols  and  smaller  fractions.  Types:  obv.  head  of Acheloos;  rev.  head  of  Kallirho\u00eb;  legend: , ,  ,  (Imhoof-Blumer  ( 1878)  156\u00ad67;Head, HN \u00b2  331\u00ad32;  Grose  ( 1926)  no. 5380;  IGCH  nos. 88,  208;  SNG Cop.  Acarnania 404).  Besides  that,  there  is  a  Pegasos  type  of C 4s  (Talbert  ( 1971)  62;Kraay ( 1976)  126  with  pl. 24  no. 437). For  the  federal  coins  struck  at  Stratos,  see  352  supra. 139.Thyrreion  (Thyrieus) Map  54.  Lat. 38.50,long.  21.00. Size of  territory: 2.  Type:  B.  The  toponym  is  ,   (IG iv\u00b2.195.16  ( 356/5);  SEG 36  331.A.26  ( 331/30\u00ad313);  in  Ps.- Skylax 34  one  should  read  instead  of  the  MS's ;  see  Kirsten  ( 1961);  Marcotte  ( 1985)  255)  or   (Polyb. 4.6.2,  24.3; in  Polyb. 18.10.10,  28.5.1).  The city-ethnic  is  (IG ix\u00b2.13A.23  ( 263?))  or   372 gehrke  and  wirbelauer (IG ix\u00b2.1582.46  (c. 207)), (Xen.  Hell. 6.2.37), (SGDI 2658  ( 315\u00ad280))  or  (Androtion (FGrHist 324)  fr. 65  Steph.  Byz. 320.21). Thyrreion  was  never  called  a  polis  before  Hellenistic  times (IG ix\u00b2.1243.2  (C 3),  244.5\u00ad6  (C 3\u00adC2,  restored);  SEG 13 327.7\u00ad8  (c. 192,restored)),unless  one  accepts  Kirsten's  emen- dation  of  Ps.-Skylax  34  (see  supra).  Xenophon  speaks,  in connection  with  poleis  in  Akarnania,  of  the  Thyrreians  hav- ing  a     (Hell. 6.2.37).  However,  Thyrreion was  a  member  of  the  Akarnanian  Confederacy,  had  a  walled urban  centre  and  struck  coins  in  C 4  (see  infra);  so  it  was probably  a  polis  in  the  Classical  period. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally in  inscriptions  of  C 3  (IG ix\u00b2.13B.3;  ix\u00b2.2243.2)  and  by  Xen. Hell. 6.2.37,  and  internally  on  coins  and  tile  stamps  (IG ix\u00b2.1 366;  SEG 25  632  (C 3)).  The  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic is  attested  externally  in  Hellenistic  inscriptions  (SGDI 2658 (Delphi, 315\u00ad280);  IG ix\u00b2.13A.23  ( 263?))  and  internally  in SEG 43  227.4\u00ad6  ( 167?). Thyrreion  was  part  of  Akarnania  (Xen.  Hell. 6.2.37;  IG iv\u00b2.195.8  16  ( 356/5);  SEG 36  331.A.15  26  ( 331/30\u00ad313)).As a  member  of  the  Akarnanian  Confederacy,  it  is  not  explicit- ly  attested  before  about  263  (IG ix\u00b2.13A.23;  cf.  also  ix\u00b2.2582 (Magnesia,  c. 207)),but  considering  the  mention  of  the  com- munity  in  Xen.  Hell. 6.2.37  and  in  the  theorodokoi  lists (supra),  membership  can  be  traced  back  at  least  to  C 4. Xenophon  regarded  the  Thyrreians  as  brave  soldiers (Hell. 6.2.37).  c. 300,  Herakleitos  of  Thyrreion  was  appointed proxenos  by  Delphi  (no. 177)  (SGDI 2658;  cf.  LGPN iiiA  195 s.v. `).  Thyrreion  appointed  theorodokoi  to host  theoroi  from  Argos  (no. 347)  (SEG 23  189.i.4  ( 330\u00ad324, restored)),  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.195.16  ( 356/5))  and Nemea  (SEG 36  331.A.26\u00ad7  ( 331/30\u00ad313)).  A  sanctuary  of Zeus  Meilichios  is  attested  in  a  C 5  horos  inscription (Mastrokostas  ( 1965)  157  no. 11  SEG 25  630). The  acropolis  of  Thyrreion  is  mentioned  in  an  unpub- lished  inscription  of  C 3;  for  the  ruins,  see  Pritchett  ( 1992) 89\u00ad90  with  references.  The  walls  are  described  by  Kirsten ( 1956)  58\u00ad59  (with  Noack's  plan)  and  Pritchett  ( 1992)  89\u00ad90 (with  bibliography);  for  recent  excavations  at  Thyrreion,  see BCH 114  ( 1990)  758.According  to Xen.  Hell. 6.2.37,Thyrreion must  have  been  fortified already in C 4  (cf.  Lang  ( 1994)  242). According  to  an  inscription  found  during  excavation  at Rouga  by  L.  Kolonas,  Thyrreion  had  a  harbour,  probably  by the  name  of  \"Nesos\". In C 4s,  Thyrreion  struck  staters  of  Corinthian  type  and standard  (pegasi),  with  the  legends  ,  ,  ,   (Imhoof-Blumer  ( 1878)  168\u00ad74).  Most  of  the  surviving  specimens  (more  than  300  pieces)  have  been  found  in hoards  from  Sicily  and  Magna  Graecia  (Talbert  ( 1971)  62; Taliercio  Mensitieri  and  Spagnoli  ( 1993)  especially  pl. 3).

The  toponym  is ,  (IG iv\u00b2.195.18  with  SEG 11  411  ( 356/5))  or ,  (SEG 23  189.i.7  (suppl., 330\u00ad324);  F.Delphes iii.3203.5  and  Flaceli\u00e8re  ( 1937)  441  n. 1  (suppl.,  both  272)). The  city-ethnic  is  (CID  II 26.18,19  (suppl.,  C 4)) or       (F.Delphes iii.3203.5  and Flaceli\u00e8re  ( 1937)  441  n. 1  (suppl.)). Torybeia  is  not  attested  as  a  polis.  But  in  C 4  theorodokoi lists  it  is  recorded  under  the  heading  Akarnania,  and  in  C 3  it is  attested  as  a  member  of  the  Confederacy  (see  infra).  If  one accepts  the  identification of  the  ruins  of  Komboti  with Torybeia  (cf.  Kirsten  ( 1940)  298ff;  Klaffenbach  ( 1957)  36; Pritchett  ( 1992)  104\u00ad8;  Hoepfner  and  Schwandner  ( 1994) 340  n. 333)  and  the  interpretation  of  the  coins  given  below, there  can  be  little  doubt  that  Torybeia  was  a  polis  already  in the  Classical  period. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  perhaps  attested internally  on  coins  (in  abbreviation,  see  infra);  the  external and  individual  use  is  attested  in  two  Delphic  inscriptions (CID ii  26.18,  19  (suppl.,  C 4);  F.Delphes iii.3203.5  (C 3)). Torybeia  was  part  of  Akarnania  (IG iv\u00b2.195.8 18  with SEG 11  411)  and  is  attested  in  272  as  a  member  of  the Akarnanian  koinon  (F.Delphes iii.3203.5  and  Flaceli\u00e8re ( 1937)  441  n. 1  (restored)).  It  appointed  theorodokoi  to  host theoroi  from  Argos  (no. 347)  (SEG 23  189.i.7  ( 330\u00ad324, restored))  and  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.195.18;  SEG 11 411);  cf.  Cabanes  ( 1985)  346\u00ad47. The  kastro  of  Komboti,  presumably  the  site  of  Torybeia, shows  remains  of  an  agora  and  stoas  (Heuzey  ( 1860)  350ff; Pritchett  ( 1992)  104\u00ad8)  as  well  as  a  circuit  wall  of  mostly polygonal  masonry  (Pritchett  loc.  cit.).  The  city  was  built  on  a grid  plan  (\"Streifenstadt\")  with  characteristic  house  types  of a  certain  luxury  (bathrooms);  see  Hoepfner  and  Schwandner ( 1994)  218,  306,  320  with  fig. 305;  Lang  ( 1994)  242\u00ad43. Imhoof-Blumer  (( 1878)  112\u00ad13)  reports  two  small  silver coins  of  similar  type  and  of  equal  weight  with  types:  obv.

Both  Koronta  (no. 124)  and  Torybeia  were  situat- ed  in  central  Akarnania  and,  in  the  light  of  the  epigraphical evidence,  we  should  now  tentatively  interpret  the  letters  as abbreviations  of  the  city-ethnics  () and ().

The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally by  Hdt. 9.28.5,  31.4;  Thuc. 1.27.2,  2.30.2;  and  in  a  Hellenistic inscription  from  Magnesia  (I.Magnesia 35.39)  and  internal- ly,  in  abbreviation,  on  coins  (see  infra).  The  individual  use is  attested  externally  as in  a Delphic  inscription  (BCH 68/9  ( 1944\u00ad45)  121  no. 32.4 (C 3)). The  territory  of  Paleis  lies  in  the  western  part  of  the  island of  Kephallenia  (cf.  Thuc. 2.30.2;  Paus. 6.15.7),  today  called Paliki. Hdt. 9.28.5  (cf. 31.4)  erroneously  lists  200  hoplites  from Paleis  among  the  Greeks  fighting at Plataiai (cf.  B\u00fcrchner ( 1921)  210,  212\u00ad13;  Wirbelauer  ( 1998)  319\u00ad20). In 435  the  Paleis  supported  the  Corinthian  campaign against  Korkyra  (no. 123)  with  four  ships  (Thuc. 1.27.2).  For membership  in  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League  and  the Corinthian  League,  other  alliances,  military  matters,  envoys, theorodokoi,  officials,  taxation  and  founding  myth,  see  the collective attestations  of  Kephallenians  cited  s.v.  Kranioi (no. 125). A  [.  .  .] was  appointed  proxenos  by  Delphi  (no. 177)  in  358/7  (F.Delphes iii.4376.4  (suppl.)). A  sanctuary  of  Poseidon(?)  was  discovered  in  the  south- ern  part  of  the  Paliki  peninsula  at  Valtsa  (cf.  Randsborg ( 1995)  97  and  ( 2002)  ii. 59,  310).  The  acropolis  of  Paleis  was situated  on  a  hill  at  a  distance  of 1.5  km  to the  north  of  the modern  town  of  Lixuri.  Remains  of  the  walls  described  by travellers  up  to  the  eighteenth  century  have  disappeared because  the  stones  were  reused  in  buildings  in  Lixuri (B\u00fcrchner  ( 1921)  211;  Steinhart  and  Wirbelauer  ( 2002) 333\u00ad34;  Randsborg  ( 2002)  ii. 281\u00ad82). The  silver  coinage  of  Paleis  started  with  a  single  type (BMC  Peloponnesus 84  no. 1:  obv.  ram  with  legend  ;  rev. pine-cone  and  sprays,  all  in  incuse  square),  before  431.From 431  onward,  Paleis  struck  silver  coins.  Denominations: tetrobols  and  smaller  fractions.  Types:  Kephalos  or Persephone  (wearing  barley  wreath);  legend: and/or or .  Bronze  coins  date  from  C 5\u00adC2 (see  in  general  Postolakas  ( 1868)  94\u00ad96;  Biedermann  ( 1887) 67\u00ad68;Head,  HN \u00b2427\u00ad28;Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 2.  795\u00ad802; akarnania  and  adjacent  areas  369 Grose  ( 1926)  nos. 6684\u00ad93;Kraay ( 1976)  96;  SNG  Cop.

Hell. 6.2.3;  IG iv\u00b2.195.20  ( 356/5)).  The city-ethnic  is  (Hdt. 8.45;  Thuc. 3.94.2;ML  27.10 ( 479);  IG ii\u00b2  104  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 278  ( 368)).  According  to Ps.-Skylax 34,  the  polis  of  Leukas  was  called  ' in  earlier  times.  This  name  of  a   \u00b5   is known  also  to  Steph.  Byz. 274.11  (from  Hecat.  fr. 110). 364 gehrke  and  wirbelauer Leukas  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skylax  34 and  in  the  political  sense  by  Thuc. 1.30.3.At  Thuc. 3.94.2  polis is  used  in  the  urban  and  political  senses  simultaneously.  It was  included  among  the  Aristotelian  politeiai  (no. 101, Gigon);  for  the  use  of  politeia  in  connection  with  Leukas,  cf. Arist.  loc.  cit.).  At  Hecat.  fr. 102c  Strabo  6.2.4  we  cannot  be certain  that  the  term  polis  stems  from  Hekataios. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally on  the  Serpent  Column  from  Delphi  (ML  27.10)  and  in  Hdt. 8.45  and  Thuc. 3.94.2;  internally  it  is  found  on  C 5\u00adC4  coins ( and  various  abbreviations).  The  individ- ual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  several inscriptions  (e.g.  IAEpi 14  (Epidauros,  C 4\u00adC3))  and  by  Hdt. 9.38.2. The  polis  of  Leukas  (Ps.-Skylax  34)  was  situated  on  the island  of  the  same  name  (Harp.  s.v.),  which  was  also,  qua  ter- ritory,  called (Thuc. 3.94.1).  To  the  north  and north-east,  the  Leukadians  bordered  on  the  Thesprotians (Hdt. 8.47).An  isthmus  with  an  artificial c hannel  (dioryktos) connected  the  northern  part  of  the  island  with  the  mainland (Strabo  10.2.8;  cf.  Partsch  ( 1889)  2\u00ad7;(1907),  Fiedler  ( 1996) 159).  A  part  of  the  mainland  opposite  was,  as  peraia,  under Leukadian  control  (Thuc. 3.94.2).  Part of  this  peraia  may have  been  the  fortified place N erikos  (Thuc. 3.7.4;Strabo 10.2.8),  which  can  be  identified t entatively  with  the  ruins near  Ag.  Georgios  (dominating  the  southern  entrance  into the  Leukas  channel),  as  suggested  by  Fiedler  (( 1996)  159\u00ad60, 162)  and  others.  Other  place-names  attested  for  Leukas island  are  Ellomenon  (Thuc. 3.94.1)  and  Phara  (Ps.-Skylax 34);  in  all  probability,  they  were  dependent  settlements;  they cannot  be  located  with  certainty  (for  the  proposals,  see Fiedler  ( 1996)  159\u00ad60  and  s.v.  Palairos  (no. 131)).  There  are various  remains  on  the  island  (see  in  general  Fiedler  ( 1996) 161\u00ad68),  among  them  a  Doric  temple  at  Agios  Ioannis Rodakis  (D\u00f6rpfeld  ( 1927)  263\u00ad64). Leukas  was  founded  during  the  reign  of  the  tyrant Kypselos  (Strabo  10.2.8,  for  the  date  ( 657/6\u00ad627/6),  see Gehrke  ( 1990)  34;  Oberhummer  ( 1887)  76  proposed  c. 635)  by Corinthians  (no. 227)  (e.g.  Hdt. 8.45;  Thuc. 1.30.2;  Ps.-Skylax 34;Dem.  9.34.).  New  settlers  arrived  in  the  time  of  his  succes- sor  Periander  (Plut.  Mor. 552E).  The  oecist  was  Pylades  (Nic. Dam.  (FGrHist 90)  fr. 57.7),and  the  colonists  were  sent  out  by Kypselos  and  his  son  Gorgos  (Strabo  10.2.8). According  to  the  Alkmaionis  (fr. 5,  Bernab\u00e9;  Ephor.  fr. 124  Strabo  10.2.9),  Leukadios,  son  of  Ikarios,  Penelope's father,  was  the  eponym of  Leukas. Leukas  was  a  member  of  the  following  leagues:  Hellenic League  of 481  (ML 27.10;  Hdt. 8.45  et passim;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 130),  Peloponnesian  League  (Thuc. 2.9.3;Diod.  12.42.4 (r 431);  Paus. 10.9.10  (r 405)),  Second  Athenian  Naval  League (IG ii\u00b2  104  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 278  ( 368);  cf.  Dreher  ( 1995b)  191 with  n. 122),  Hellenic  League  against  Philip  II  (Dem. 18.237; Aeschin. 3.95\u00ad98  ( 256);  cf.  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 343)  and  against Antipater  in  323  (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 413).  Leukas  did  not  enter the  Akarnanian  Confederacy  until  the  years  280/265  (cf.  IG ix\u00b2.13A.24  ( 263?);  cf.  Funke  et al.( 1993)  134;  Schoch  ( 1997) 74). In 435,  Leukas  was  allied  with  Corinth  (no. 227)  against Epidamnos  (no. 79)  (Thuc. 1.26.1,  27.2)  and  against  Korkyra (no. 123)  in  433  (Thuc. 1.46.1).  During  the  Corinthian  War,  it was  allied  with  Boiotia,  Athens  (no. 361),  Corinth  and  Argos (no. 347)  (Diod. 14.82.3;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 225).  In  368,  Leukas concluded  a  treaty(?)  with  Athens  (no. 361)  (IG ii\u00b2 104  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 278). Leukas  was  engaged  in  the  following  campaigns  and  bat- tles:  in  the  battle  of  Salamis  with  three  ships  (Hdt. 8.45);  at Plataiai  together  with  Anaktorion  (no. 114)  with  800 hoplites  (Hdt. 9.28.5);  at  Epidamnos  and  Sybota  with  ten ships  (Thuc. 1.27.2,  46.1);  in  the  campaign  of 427  with  thir- teen  ships  (together  with  Ambrakia  (no. 113);Thuc.3.69.1,cf. Diod. 30.40.5);  in  414  with  two  ships  sent  to  Taras  (no. 71; Thuc. 6.104);  in  the  battle  of  Aigos  potamoi  ( 405)  under Telykrates  in  Lysander's  fleet (Paus. 10.9.10);  against Korkyra,  supporting  the  Lakedaimonian  fleet,  in  373/2  (Xen. Hell. 6.2.3,26);  following  Timoleon  to  Sicily  with  one  ship  in 345/4  (Plut.  Tim. 8.5).  The  Leukadian  mercenary  leader Euthymos  first fought under T imoleon,  later  against  him, and  was  executed  by  him  c. 339  (ibid. 30.6\u00ad9  and 32). Leukadian  envoys  took  the  oaths  on  a  treaty  with  Athens (IG ii\u00b2  104  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 278).The  Leukadians  Nausigenes and  Euandros  were  appointed  proxenoi  by  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IAEpi 14  (C 4\u00adC3)).Theorodokoi  were  appointed  to  host theoroi  from  Argos  (no. 347)  (SEG 23  189.i.8  ( 330\u00ad324)), Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.195.20  ( 356/5);  IAEpi 14)  and Nemea  (SEG 36  331.B.9\u00ad13  ( 331/30\u00ad313)).  In  the  320s,  Leukas imported  15,000  medimnoi  of  grain  from  Kyrene  (no. 1028) (SEG 92.20  Tod 196). In  the  Archaic  or  early  Classical  period  the  constitution changed  from  oligarchy  to  democracy.An  Archaic  law  seems to  have  prescribed  the  preservation  of  the  old  .The abolition  of  this  law  led  to  a  democratisation  of  the Leukadian  constitution,  perhaps  in  C 6\u00adC5  (Arist.  Pol. 1266b21\u00ad24;Gehrke,  Stasis 101).Magistrates  are  attested  gen- erally,  as  ,  by  Arist.  Pol. 1266b24.M\u00fcnsterberg  ( 1973)  43 records  more  than  sixty  names  of  officials on L eukadian coins. akarnania  and  adjacent  areas  365 An  agora  is  attested  explicitly  only  for  the  Hellenistic period  (forum,Livy 33.17.12  (r 197));  no  remains  of  it have  yet  been  found  (Fiedler  ( 1996)  162).  From  a  votive inscription  on  a  miniature  bronze  helmet  crest  we  know  of a  dedication  to  Athena  (IG ix\u00b2.1  1237(C6)).  A  temple  of Apollo  was  situated  near  the  isthmus  and  the  polis  of Leukas  (Thuc. 3.94.2;Strabo  10.2.9;Plut.  Pomp. 24,  but  cf. D\u00f6rpfeld  ( 1927)  271).  There  were  temples  of  Hera (Heraeum,Livy 33.17.2,  near  the  city)  and  of  Aphrodite Aineas  (Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 1.50.4,  on  an  island  between the  dioryktos  and  the  polis,  cf.  the  mention  of  a  temple  of Aphrodite  in  a  Messenian  inscription  of  C 2:  Themelis ( 1993)  35;  Strauch  ( 1997)  240  with  n. 120);  for  the  remains  of a  temple  at  Ag.  Ioannis  Rodakis,  see  supra. The  site  of  the  \u00b5  (Ps.-Skylax  34)  is  unknown  (Fiedler ( 1996)  162).  Two  moles  have  been  found  at  the  southern  end of  the  Leukas  channel  (Murray  ( 1982)  226ff;  ( 1988)  101ff; Fiedler  ( 1996)  162;  Schoch  ( 1997)  20).  The  acropolis  (arx, Livy  33.17.11  (r 197))  was  presumably  situated  on  the  north- ern  hill  of  the  city  (Fiedler  ( 1996)  162).  There  are  only  a  few, undated  remains  of  a  city  wall  (cf.  muri,  moenia:Livy 33.17.4, 9\u00ad10,  13  (r 197))  and  of  other  walls  to  the  north  and  north- west  of  the  ancient  polis  (Fiedler  ( 1996)  161\u00ad63).The  remains of  houses  dating  to  the  Classical/Hellenistic  period  were  laid out  in  accordance  with  a  grid-plan  street  system  (Fiedler ( 1996)  161\u00ad62). The  Leukadian  mint  is  the  oldest  known  in  Akarnania, and  its  coins  had  the  widest  circulation.  The  silver  coinage started  in  about 490  and  was  strongly  influenced  by Corinth  (no. 227)(Carter(1993);  cf.  Anaktorion  (no. 114)). Next  to  the  Corinthian,  the  Leukadian  pegasi  are  the  coins most  frequently  found  in  Sicilian  and  South  Italian  hoards (Talbert  ( 1971)  60,  62;  IGCH  passim  (cf.  p. 401);  Taliercio Mensitieri  and  Spagnoli  ( 1993)  especially  pls. 3,  5c  (more than 500  pieces);  CH  viii. 53,  95,  159,  160,  167,  226,  232,  264, 506).  Denominations:  stater,  drachm  and  smaller  fractions. Types:  obv.  Pegasos;  rev.  head  of  Athena;  legend: ,  some- times or .  Smaller  C 4  denominations struck  in  bronze  with  various  types.  More  than  sixty  names of  officials  are  attested  on  Leukadian  coins  (M\u00fcnsterberg ( 1973)  43;  for  the  coins,  see  generally  Postolakas  ( 1868) 54\u00ad89;  Imhoof-Blumer  ( 1878)  115\u00ad38;Head,  HN \u00b2329\u00ad31.

Perhaps  more Akarnanian  Echinaioi  are  mentioned  in  Greek  inscriptions, but  normally  an  Echinaios  will  be  identified w ith  a  citizen  of the  homonymous  city  in  Malis,  cf.  e.g.  SEG 25  642  ( 168/7). Echinos  is,  in  all  probability,  to  be  located  at  the  ancient site  of  the  Kastro  of  Prophitis  Elias  (Pritchett  ( 1992)  93\u00ad101). Echinos  is  commonly  located  on  the  bay  of  Rouga  (Heuzey ( 1860)  375\u00ad76;  Oberhummer  ( 1887)  36;  Philippson  ( 1905); Klaffenbach  ( 1957)  33).But  Rouga  is  an  obvious  place  for  the harbour  of  Thyrreion  (no. 139).  According  to  an  inscription found  during  an  excavation  at  Rouga  by  L.  Kolonas  (not  yet published),  its  probable  name  was  Nesos. Echinos  is  not  attested  as  a  polis.  The  Hellenistic  poet Rhianos  of  Bene  called  it  (Steph.  Byz. 292.16\u00ad17: '   ,(?)  conj.Jacoby,  FGrHist 265,fr. 34).As  a  member  of  the  Akarnanian  Confederacy  which  had an  urban  centre  and  presumably  struck  coins,  Echinos  was probably  a  polis,  at  least  from  C 4  (infra). The  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  an  Attic decree  of 349/8  (IG ii\u00b2  208,  the  individual  use  in  line  1,  the collective in  line  7  (suppl.)).  For  the  individual  use,  see  also    ' ',in a funerary epigram from Kos (IG ix\u00b2.1579.6  (C 3)). According  to  the  theorodokoi  lists,  Echinos  was  part  of Akarnania  (IG iv\u00b2.195.8 17  ( 356/5);  SEG 36  331.A.15 24 ( 331/30\u00ad313)).  The  mythical  founder  and  eponym  was Echinos  (Rhianos  (FGrHist 265)  fr. 34  Steph.  Byz. 292.16\u00ad17).  Membership  of  the  Akarnanian  Confederacy  is well  attested  (IG ii\u00b2  208.1,  6ff  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 325  ( 349/8),  cf. IG ix\u00b2.1579.6  (C 3)). Echinos  sent  envoys  to Athens  (no. 361)  in  349/8  (IG ii\u00b2 208;  cf.  Wilhelm  ( 1889)  127\u00ad30),  and  there  were  Echinaian theorodokoi  to  host  theoroi  from  Epidauros  (no. 348)  and from  Nemea  (supra). The  remains  of  the  site  of  Kastro  to  be  identified w ith Echinos  are  described  by  Pritchett  ( 1992)  93\u00ad97,  who  men- tions  Geometric,  Classical  and  Hellenistic  pottery.  The  walls have  been  compared  with  those  of  Rhamnous  and Eleutherai  by Heuzey ( 1860)  381\u00ad82.A temenos  of  Apollo  is attested  in  an  epigram  found  at  the  Kastro  (IG ix\u00b2.1238.5;  cf. now  Pritchett  ( 1992)  95). A  Pegasos-type  stater  on  the  Corinthian  standard  (obv. head  of  Athena  with  fish-hook;  legend:  E)  has  tentatively been  attributed  to  Echinos  (Imhoof-Blumer  ( 1878)  100; Head,  HN \u00b2329).  Since  then,  eight  coins  of  this  type  have been  found  in  Sicilian  and  South  Italian  hoards  (Talbert ( 1971)  62;  IGCH  no. 2187;  Taliercio  Mensitieri  and  Spagnoli ( 1993)  especially  pls. 1,  3;  CH  viii. 232);  the  coinage  can  be dated  to  C 4s:  SNG  Cop.

Ambrakia  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Thuc. 3.105.4,110.1,112.1,8,113.2,4,5;  Ps.-Skylax 33;  and  in  the  polit- ical  sense  by  Thuc. 3.113.6  and 7.25.9;  it  is  subsumed  under the  heading  poleis  at  Thuc. 2.9.2,  3.A polites  is  attested  in  an inscription  (SEG 41  540A.9  (C 6)),  and  among  the Aristotelian  politeiai  there  was  one  of  Ambrakia  (fr. 481.1).In an  early  inscription  Ambrakia  is  referred  to  as  patris  (SEG 41 540A.9  (C 6)). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally on  the  Serpent  Column  from  Delphi  (ML  27.11)  and  in  other inscriptions  (IG ii\u00b2  236.b.6;  SEG 92.19,  56\u00ad57  Tod 196 ( 330\u00ad325)),  internally  on  coins  (see  infra;  cf.  the  undated  tile stamp  SEG 34  588c).  The  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  externally,  especially  in  inscriptions  at  Delphi  (CID ii  4.iii.28;  SEG 31  535.2  (both  C 4)). The  name  of  the  territory  was  \u00b5  (Archestratos fr. 16.1,  Olson  and  Sens Suppl.  Hell. 146.1;  Ps.-Skylax 33; Etym.  Magn. 81.3\u00ad4).  It  is  briefly described b y  Polyb. 21.26.3\u00ad4.  Ambrakia  bordered  on  the  Thesprotians  (Hdt. According  to  the  conventions  of  the  database,  the  ethnics  attested  in  the inscriptions  of  the  Akarnanian  Confederacy  are  classified as external  because they  were  not  found  \"inside\"the  respective  poleis.  On  the  other  hand,  the  decrees of  Korkyra,  Same  and  Ithaka  recorded  in  Magnesia  are  considered  to  be  internal, because  the  written  documentation  alone  is  external  whereas  the  decisions  were taken  in  the  poleis  mentioned  and  the  wording  is  their  own.  By  contrast,  the decrees  summarised  by  the  Magnesians  with         are  seen  as  external,  the  original  wording  being  unknown. 354 gehrke  and  wirbelauer 8.47)  and  on  the  Amphilochians  (Hecat.  fr. 26;  Thuc. 2.68.5), and  was  situated  in  the  region  of  Dryopis  (Dion.  Calliphon. 30,GGM  i239);Athanadas  (FGrHist 303)  fr. 1).It  had  a  \u00b5 (Ps.-Skylax  33;  Dion.  Calliphon. 29\u00ad30,  GGM  I 239),  and  a  fort  \u00b5  stood  in  the  lagoons  of  the  river Arachthus  (Polyb. 4.61.4\u00ad8,  63.1\u00ad2;  Steph.  Byz. 85.10  calls  it  a ),  which  can  be  identified w ith  remains  on  the island  of  Phidokastro (Hammond  ( 1967)  138;Tzouvara- Souli  ( 1992)  208\u00ad9).  Two  other  settlements  are  mentioned by  Steph.  Byz.  ( 381.13  with  reference  to Theopomp.  fr. 229 ( \u00b7    \u00b5),  377.17  ( \u00b7     \u00b5)).  Another  fortress,  Herakleia, with  a  sanctuary  of  Herakles,  occurs  in  a  Hellenistic  inscrip- tion  (SEG 35  665.A.18,  27  (c. 160)).  The  territory  was  divided into  \u00b5  ( \u00b5  ,Steph.Byz. 225.10)  and  a  \u00b5 '   (SEG 35  665.A.18,  20  (c. 160))  are  attested),  but they  must  not  have  been  administrative  units. Ambrakia  was  founded  by  Corinthians  (no. 227)  (Thuc. 2.80.3;Dem.  3.34)  at  the  time  of  Kypselos  (Strabo  7.6.6, 10.2.8;  Ant.  Lib.  Met. 4.4),  i.e.  between  657/6  and 627/6  (for the  date  of  Kypselos,  see  Gehrke  ( 1990)  34).  The  oecist  was Gorgos,  son  of  Kypselos  (Ps.-Skymnos  455;  Nic.  Dam. (FGrHist 90)  fr. 59.1;Strabo 10.2.8  (MS  Gargasos);  Ant.  Lib. Met. 4.4  (MS  Torgos);  one  coin  attested:  Kraay  ( 1976)  no. 428 with  the  name  added). After  the  expulsion  of  the  tyrant  Periander  (Arist.  Pol. 1304a31\u00ad33,  1311a40\u00adb1;  cf.  Plut.  Mor. 768F  (rC 6)),  Ambrakia was  organised  as  a  moderate  oligarchy  with  a  low  census, later  as  a  democracy  (Arist.  Pol. 1303a20\u00ad25;Diod.  17.3.3;  cf. Gehrke,  Stasis 19;  Sch\u00fctrumpf  and  Gehrke  ( 1996)  455).After the  battle  of  Chaironeia,  an  oligarchy  was  established,  sup- ported  by a  Makedonian  garrison,  but  after  the  death  of Philip  II,  Ambrakia  became  democratic  again  (Diod. 17.3.3, 4.3;  cf.  Gehrke,  Stasis 19).The  historical  circumstances  of  the tyranny  of  a  certain  Phalaikos  (or  Phaylos)  in  Ambrakia (e.g.Ant.  Lib.  Met. 4.4\u00ad5)  remain  dubious,  cf.  Key\u00dfner  ( 1938) 1612. Ambrakia  was  a  member  of  the  Hellenic  League  against Persia  (Hdt. 8.45,47,9.28.5,9.31.4;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 130).Before the  Peloponnesian  War,  it  sided  with  the  Corinthians  (no. 227)  against  Korkyra  (no. 123)  and  acted,  consistently,  as  a Spartan  ally  during  the  war  (Thuc. 2.9.2,  2.80.5,  3.105.1, 6.104.1,  8.106.3),  although  in  426  it  was  forced  to conclude  a symmachia  and  a  treaty  with  the  Akarnanians  and  the Amphilochians  (Thuc. 3.114.3;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 175).  In  395, Ambrakia  became  a  member  of  the  alliance  between Boiotia,  Athens  (no. 361),  Corinth  (no. 227)  and  Argos  (no. 347)  against  Sparta  (no. 345)  (Diod. 14.82.3;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 225),  but  it  sided  with  Sparta  against  Athens  and  Korkyra  in 375  and 373/2  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.65\u00ad66,6.2.3).Ambrakia  is  attest- ed  as  a  member  of  the  Corinthian  League  of 338/7  (IG ii\u00b2 236.b.6;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 130)  and  of  the  Hellenic  League  of 323 (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 413).  In  317/16,  it  was  allied  with  Olympias (Diod. 19.35.7). Ambrakia  was  engaged  with  contingents  in  the  following battles:  against  Korkyra  on  the  river  Arachthus  c. 600  (CEG i 145;  cf.  Hammond  ( 1967)  493;  Andreou  ( 1991)  436\u00ad38); against  the  Perrhaibians  together  with  Corinth  (no. 227)  in C 6  (SEG 41  540A.7;  cf.  Cassio  ( 1994)  and  SEG 44  463);  at Salamis  with  seven  ships  (Hdt. 8.45);  at  Plataiai  with  500 hoplites  (Hdt. 9.28.5,  31.4);  at  Epidamnos  in  435  with  eight ships  (Thuc. 1.27.2);  at  Sybota  in  433  with 27  (Thuc. 1.46.1); and  against  Korkyra  together  with  Leukas  (no. 126)  in  427 with  thirteen  ships  (Thuc. 3.69.1).  In  425,  Ambrakia  went  to war  against  Akarnania  and  Amphilochian  Argos  (no. 115) with  at  least  3,000  hoplites  (Thuc. 3.105.1),  and  in  414,  three Ambrakian  ships  joined  the  Corinthian  fleet ( Thuc. 6.104.1).  In  405,  the  Ambrakian  Euantidas  fought  under Lysander's  command  at  Aigos  potamoi  (Paus. 10.9.10).  In 375  and 373/2,  Ambrakia  supported  the  Peloponnesian  navy with  six  ships  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.65\u00ad66,  6.2.3). The  patron  deities  were  Apollo  Soter  (or  Agyieus)  and Herakles;  cf.  the  aition  reported  by Ant.  Lib.  Met. 4  (cf.  SEG 35  665.B.33\u00ad34,  45  (C 2),  with  Cabanes  and  Andr\u00e9ou  ( 1985) 513,  531,  533\u00ad34;  Jacoby,  comm.  in  Athanadas  (FGrHist 303); Tzouvara-Souli  ( 1992)  197\u00ad200).  The  Ambrakians  used  a Dorian  calendar  like  Corinth  (no. 227)  and  Korkyra (Bischoff  ( 1919)  1592  no. 32;  cf.  Cabanes  and  Andr\u00e9ou  ( 1985) 536\u00ad37).  Sophron  of  Ambrakia  is  recorded  as  a  winner  in  the Olympic  Games  of 432  (Olympionikai 321). The  eponymous  hero  of  the  polis  was  Ambrax,  son  of Thesprotos  and  grandson  of  Lykaon  (Steph.  Byz. 84.22\u00ad85.1; Eust.  Comm.  Dionys.  Per. 493,  but  see  Hecat.  fr. 26)  or  son  of Dexamenos  and  grandson  of  Herakles  (Dion.  Hal.  Ant. Rom. 1.50.4).  According  to another  version,  Ambrakia, daughter  of  the  Dryopian  king  Melaneus  or  Augeas  or Phorbas,  son  of  Helios,  was  eponymous  (cf.  Ant.  Lib.  Met. 4.3;  Steph.  Byz. 85.1\u00ad2,  225.11\u00ad12;  Eust.  Comm.  Dionys.  Per. 493). Ambrakian  theorodokoi  are  attested  for  theoroi  from Argos  (no. 347;  SEG 23  189.i.10  ( 330\u00ad324)),  Delphi  (no. 177) (SEG 31  535.2  (c. 320))  and  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.195.32, 81\u00ad82  ( 356/5)).  In  the  Delphic  decree  a  grant  of  proxenia  was added  to  the  grant  of  theorodokia  (SEG 31  535.3). Public  architecture  is  not  attested  before  the  Hellenistic period,  nor  are  there  ruins  of  older  public  buildings  except akarnania  and  adjacent  areas  355 for  the  remains  of  a  late  Archaic  temple  (Tzouvara-Souli ( 1992)  43;Lang  ( 1996)  296  with  n. 529).The  acropolis  was  sit- uated  on  the  hill  called  Perranthes  (Livy  38.4.1,  4.6,  5.2;  cf. Hammond  ( 1967)  143).The  walls  mentioned  by  Livy  ( 38.4.4) belong  primarily  to the  time  of  Pyrrhos;  they  enclose  an  area of  c. 130  ha,  but  there  are  remains  of  the  older  walls  of  late Archaic  or  Classical  times  (Hammond  ( 1967)  141\u00ad44,  481, 584\u00ad85,  659;  Cabanes  and  Andr\u00e9ou  ( 1985)  525\u00ad27  (sketch); Pritchett  ( 1992)  120  with  reference  to Catling;  Tzouvara- Souli  ( 1992)  26\u00ad31;  Andr\u00e9ou  ( 1993)  93\u00ad94;  Lang  ( 1996)  296). The  city  buildings  follow  a  plan  with  a  rectangular  road  sys- tem  (Tzouvara-Souli  ( 1992)  31\u00ad33;  Andr\u00e9ou  ( 1993)  93\u00ad94; Lang  ( 1996)  297\u00ad98)  in  both  Archaic  and  Classical  times.  It has  been  suggested  that  one  of  the  two  theatres  attested  by archaeology  goes  back  to  C 4l  (TGR  ii. 129)  and  is  the  one referred  to  at  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 1.50.4  (cf.  Frederiksen ( 2002)  72). Ambrakia  struck  coins  on  the  Corinthian  standard  and with  Corinthian  types  (pegasi)  in  about  480,  in  the  430s  and in  C 4s  (Kraay  ( 1977),  ( 1979),  and  Talbert  ( 1971);  IGCH  pas- sim  (cf.  p. 395);  Kraay  ( 1976)  126\u00ad28;  Taliercio  Mensitieri  and Spagnoli  ( 1993),  especially  pls. 3  and 5b\u00adf,  h,  i,  l;  CH  viii. 226, 450,  530).  They  bear  the  legends  , ,or and  various abbreviations  (Head,  HN \u00b2  319\u00ad20;  Franke  ( 1961)  323\u00ad32; Hammond  ( 1967)  717\u00ad31;  Tzouvara-Souli  ( 1992)  127\u00ad32;  cf.

Size  of  territory: 2.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is (Thuc. 1.55.1;  IG iv\u00b2.195.22  ( 356/5)),  originally (cf.  the  city-ethnic  ~).  The  city- ethnic  is  (coins  with   (infra);  IG ix\u00b2.13A.24  ( 263?)),  originally  (ML 27.10  (Delphi, 479),  and  the  earliest  coin  legend),  or (Hdt. 9.28.5;  Thuc. 1.46.1;  coins  with (infra)). Anaktorion  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  and  political senses  simultaneously  by  Thuc. 4.49  (Hansen  ( 1998)  32\u00ad33); in  the  urban  sense  implicitly  by  Ps.-Skylax  34,  and  in  the political  sense  Anaktorion  is  subsumed  under  the  heading poleis  at  Thuc. 1.46.1\u00ad2  and 2.9.2\u00ad3. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally on  the  Serpent  Column  from  Delphi  (ML  27.10  ( 479))  and internally  on  coins  (see  infra).  The  individual  use  of  the  city- ethnic  is  attested  in  the  inscription  concerning  the  cult  of Artemis  Leukophryene  in  Magnesia  (IG ix\u00b2.1582.5  (c. 207)). The  name  of  the  territory  was     (Thuc. 1.29.3)  situated    \u00b5    \u00b5  (Thuc. 1.55.1,  4.49),  40  stades  from  Actium  (Strabo  10.2.7). Anaktorion  possessed  a  \u00b5  (Ps.-Skylax  34)  inside  the Gulf  of  Arta  and  another  ,  at  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo Aktios  (Strabo  10.2.7).  Anaktorion  was  part  of  Akarnania according  to  the  theorodokoi  lists  (IG iv\u00b2.195.8  22;  SEG 36 331.A.15  20  (both  C 4s))  and  Ps.-Skylax  34. Anaktorion  was  founded  by  Corinthians  (no. 227;  Paus. 5.23.3;  Steph.  Byz. 92.15\u00ad16;  the  participation  of  Korkyra  (no. 123)  is  disputed;  cf.  Domingo-Forast\u00e9  ( 1988)  6\u00ad42;  De  Fidio ( 1995)  125ff)  at  the  time  of  Kypselos  ( 657/6\u00ad627/6;  for  the date,  see  Gehrke  ( 1990)  34;Strabo 10.2.8;  Nic.  Dam.  (FGrHist 90)  fr. 57.7).For  a  discussion  of  Plut.  Mor. 552E  (colonisation of  Anaktorion  under  Periander's  rule),  see  Domingo- Forast\u00e9  ( 1988)  8\u00ad11.  The  oecist  was  Echiades  (Nic.  Dam.  loc. cit.).  Thucydides'  description  of  Anaktorion  as   ( 4.49)  indicates  that  in  C 5  it  was  still,  at  least  to  some extent,  controlled  by  its  metropolis. During  the  Great  Persian  War,  Anaktorion  belonged  to the  Hellenic  League  (Hdt. 9.28.5,  31.4;ML  27.10; Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 130).  It  is  attested  as  a  symmachos  of  Sparta (no. 345)  in  431  and 429  (Thuc. 2.9.2,  80.5)  and  entered  into alliance  with  Thebes  (no. 221)  during  the  Third  Sacred  War (IG vii  2418).  In the  battle  of  Plataiai,  Anaktorion  was  pres- ent,  together  with  Leukas  (no. 126),  with  800  hoplites  (Hdt. 9.28.5).  During  the  Korkyra  campaign  of 435,  it  joined  the Corinthians  (no. 227)  with  one  ship  under  its  own  com- mander  (Thuc. 1.46.1). Being  founded  by  Corinthians,  Anaktorion  was       (Thuc. 1.55.1).  In  432  it  was  captured  by  the  Corinthians  and  received  new  Corinthian settlers  (ibid.;  Losada  ( 1972)  17).  When  it  was  captured  by Athenians  and  Akarnanians  in  425,  the  Akarnanians  sent  new  colonists  (Thuc. 4.49,  probably  reflected in  Ps.-Skymnos  460\u00ad61).  After  that,  Anaktorion  must  have been  a  member  of  the  Akarnanian  Confederacy  (Freitag ( 1996)  85\u00ad86,  attested  in  IG ix\u00b2.13A.24  ( 263?),  583.8  ( 216), 582.41  (c. 207)). Theorodokoi  were  appointed  to  host  theoroi  from  Argos (no. 347)  (SEG 23  189.i.3  ( 330\u00ad324)),  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.195.22,  76\u00ad77  ( 356/5))  and  Nemea  (SEG 36  331.A.20\u00ad23 ( 331/30\u00ad313)).  The  public  assembly  of  Anaktorion  was  called halia,  the  eponymous  magistrate  was  a  prytanis  (IG ix\u00b2.1 212.1,  3  (C 4\u00adC3));  cf.  Sherk  ( 1990a)  257. The  famous  sanctuary  of  Apollo  Aktios  was  situated  out- side  the  city  (Thuc. 1.29.3;  cf.  IG ix\u00b2.1583.14\u00ad15,  54  (Olympia, 216)  and 582.40\u00ad41  (Magnesia,  c. 207)),  with  a  temple  of 356 gehrke  and  wirbelauer Apollo  (Strabo 7.7.6),  a  Helenaion,  other  unknown  struc- tures .[  ] and  parembolai,  i.e.  places  for  camping visitors  (IG ix\u00b2.1583.38\u00ad41;  cf.  Habicht  ( 1957)  98\u00ad102).  There was  a  festival  ( ,  IG ix\u00b2.1583.45;  cf.  BE  ( 1956)  11) with  agones.From  C 4  onward,  some  types  of  coins  refer  to this  cult  and  festival. The  circuit  of  the  city  walls  was  described  by  Leake  ( 1835) 493\u00ad94  (cf.  Strauch  ( 1996a)  377).  Thucydides  reports  at 4.49 that  Anaktorion  in 425  was  betrayed  to  the  Athenians,  an indication  that  the  town  was  fortified. Anaktorion  struck  coins  on  the  Corinthian  standard  and with  Corinthian  types  (pegasi)  in  the  430s  and  in  C 4s (Imhoof-Blumer  ( 1878)  53ff;  Kraay  ( 1979)  53,  55;  Domingo- Forast\u00e9  ( 1988)  132\u00ad46  and  ( 1993);  Talbert  ( 1971)  61;  IGCH  pas- sim  (cf.  p. 395);  Taliercio  Mensitieri  and  Spagnoli  ( 1993)  pl. 3; CH  viii. 159,  167,  232;  cf.  in  general  Head,  HN \u00b2329).

Argos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Thuc. 2.68.9, 3.105.1,  106.3,  and  by Ps.-Skylax  34;  the  territorial  sense  is  a connotation  at  Thuc. 2.68.4  and 6,  as  is  the  political  sense  at 2.68.4.  At  Hecat.  fr. 102c  Strabo  6.2.4  we  cannot  be  certain that  the  term  polis  stems  from  Hekataios. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally by  Thucydides  (see  supra)  and  internally  on  C 4s  coins  (see infra).  The  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  exter- nally  in  an  Athenian  proxeny  decree  (IG ii\u00b2  374.11\u00ad12  ( 322/1)) and  in  Dodona  (see  supra). The  territory was  called  (Thuc. 3.105.1,  106.3)  or \u00b5  (Thuc. 3.105.2).  There  existed  at  least  three other  settlements  within  the  territory:  Olpai  ( ,  Thuc. 3.105.1),  Metropolis  (Thuc. 3.107.1;  Pritchett  ( 1992)  25\u00ad27) and  Krenai  ( ,Thuc.3.105.2).In C5,Limnaia (no.127 ) was  part  of  the  Argeia  too  (Thuc. 2.80.8).  The  Argeia  was  situated  between  Epiros  and  Akarnania;  cf.  also  IG iv\u00b2.1 95.33. The  mythical  founder  of  Argos  was  Amphilochos  (Hecat. fr. 102c;  Thuc. 2.68.3;  Ps.-Skymnos  455\u00ad57,  according  to Ephor.  fr. 123b  together  with  his  father  and  brother,  sc. Akarnan),  the  son  of  Alkmaion  (Ephor.  fr. 123b)  or Amphiaraos  (Thuc. 2.68.3;  Ps.-Skymnos  455\u00ad57).According to Thuc. 2.68.5,  only  the  Argeians  (together  with  the Ambrakiot  settlers  expelled  at  about  440  bc,  see  infra), probably  the  population  of  the  urban  centre,  were  Hellenes while  the  other  Amphilochians  were  Barbarian  (for  a  discussion  of  the  problem  cf.  Hammond  [ 1967]  419; Hornblower [ 1991]  353\u00ad3). Whether  Argos  was  a  member  of  the  Akarnanian Confederacy  is  disputed  (Klaffenbach  ( 1957)  xviii  against Beloch  ( 1922)  291).  In  about  440  the  Amphilochians  were expelled  by  Ambrakian  settlers,  but  some  two  years  later, with  Athenian  aid,  they  were  resettled  together  with Akarnanians  in  Argos,  while  the  Ambrakian  settlers  were exposed  to andrapodismos  (Thuc. 2.68.5\u00ad7;Gehrke,  Stasis 34).  At  least  there  must  have  been  a  special  relationship between  Argos  and  the  Akarnanian  Confederacy  (Gehrke ( 1994\u00ad95)  43  with  n. 6). The  Argeian/Akarnanian  physician  Euenor  was  hon- oured  by the  Athenians  with  proxeny  (IG ii\u00b2  242 373 ( 337/6)),  later  citizenship  (IG ii\u00b2  374  ( 322/1)).  Argeian  theo- rodokoi  hosted  theoroi  from  Argos  (no. 347)  (SEG 23  189.i.9 ( 330\u00ad324))  and  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.195.33). The  surviving  walls  at  the  site  of  Neochori  are  described by Pritchett ( 1992)  20\u00ad21  (with  pls. 22\u00ad25),  those  of Palaioavli,  Pritchett's  candidate  for  Argos,  ibid. 17  (with  pls. 9\u00ad21).Argos  is  commonly  connected  with  the  ruins  near  Ag. Ioannis/Neochori  (Heuzey  ( 1860)  282ff;  Oberhummer ( 1887)  26\u00ad27;  Strauch  ( 1996c);  Barr.);  for  a  recent  discussion, see  Hammond  ( 1967)  246  and  Pritchett  ( 1992)  13\u00ad21,who locate  Argos  at  Palaioavli  (cf.  Schoch  ( 1997)  38);  but  the remains  at  Neochori  are  much more  impressive and  thus  a better  candidate  for  a  major  polis  site  than  the  ruins  at Palaioavli  (probably  ancient  Krenai,  see  supra 353). Thucydides'  description  of  the  unsuccessful  Ambrakian attack  on  Argos  in  430  indicates  that  the  city  was  fortified (Thuc. 2.68.9). Argos  struck  coins  of  silver  and  bronze  on  the  Corinthian standard  and  with  Corinthian  types  in  C 4s  (Talbert  ( 1971)  61; IGCH  passim  (cf.  p. 396);  Taliercio  Mensitieri  and  Spagnoli ( 1993)  pls. 3,5;  CH  viii. 159,167,232,431;  cf.  in  general  Imhoof- Blumer  ( 1878)  82\u00ad97).The  coins  bear  the  legends  , Perhaps  other  Argeioi  are  mentioned  in  Greek  inscriptions,  but  normally an  Argeios  will  be  identified w ith  a  citizen  of  the  famous  city  in  the  Argolid.  But the  Argeios  named  in  the  inscription  published  by  Cabanes  ( 1976)  586  no. 70.7 (Dodona,  C 4)  looks  like  a  neighbour  of  the  two  other  persons,  a  Horraitas  and  a Dodonaios;  cf.  also  the  Argeioi  in  IG ix.1\u00b2  1  25.10,  49\u00ad50;  30.21,  24,  29. akarnania  and  adjacent  areas  357 ,  ,or and  various abbreviations.

The  toponym  is  \u00b5, (Thuc. 2.80.8,  3.106.2;  IG iv\u00b2.195.8  ( 356/5)).  The  city-ethnic is \u00b5  (IG ix\u00b2.1588.9\u00ad10  (Sparta,  C 2)). Limnaia  is  not  attested  as  a  polis  in  ancient  sources.  It  is mentioned  under  the  heading  in  an  Epidaurian and  a  Nemean  theorodokoi  list  (C 4)  and  was,  at  least  in Hellenistic  times,  a  member  of  the  Akarnanian  Confederacy (see  infra).  Whether  it  was  a  polis  or  an  ethnos  in  this Confederacy  in  the  Classical  period  has  to  remain  open.  It  is called  a  \u00b5   by Thuc. 2.80.8.  The  walls  at Karvassaras  (modern  Amphilochia)  to  be  identified w ith the  site  of  Limnaia,  however,  suggest  an  urban  centre.  But they  cannot  be  dated  with  certainty  (cf.  infra). Thuc. 2.80.8  mentions  Limnaia  as  a  village  in  the  Argeia, i.e.  the  territory of  Argos  Amphilochikon  (no. 115)  which was  destroyed  by  a  Spartan  army  under  Knemon.  Limnaia seems  to  have  had  a  common  frontier  with  Medion  (no. 129) (to  the  south-west?)  and  with  the  Agraioi  (Thuc. 3.106.2). According  to  Polyb. 5.5.14,  the \u00b5 \u00b5  was  a coastal  site  in  the  Gulf  of  Arta.  Limnaia  is  attested  as  a  part  of Akarnania  in  an  Epidaurian  theorodokoi  list  (IG iv\u00b2.195.8). It  was  a  member  of  the  Akarnanian  Confederacy  (IG ix\u00b2.1 588.9\u00ad10  (Sparta,  C 2);  cf.  IG ix\u00b2.13A).  Theorodokoi  were appointed  to  host  theoroi  from  Epidauros  (no. 348;  IG iv\u00b2.1 95.8)  and  Nemea  (SEG 36  331.A.31\u00ad33  ( 331/30\u00ad313)). As  the  evidence  stands,  the  most  likely  reconstruction  is that,  in  C 5s,  Limnaia  was  a  \u00b5  belonging  to  Argos  (no. 115),  but  by 356/5  it  had  become  a  political  unit  and  acquired the  status  of  polis.  The  urban  centre  was  fortified,  and  the community  became  a  member  of  the  Akarnanian Confederacy  in  its  own  right.  See  Medion  (no. 129)  and Phoitiai  (no. 134). The  walls  at  Amphilochia,  with  polygonal  masonry,  are described  and  discussed  by  Pritchett  ( 1992)  2\u00ad6,  118\u00ad19; according  to  Winter  ( 1971)  98,  111,  they  are  not  earlier  than the  last  quarter  of  C 4. 128.  *Matropolis  (Matropolites) Map  54.

Freitag  ( 1994)  223\u00ad24  no. 11). Perhaps  other  Akarnanian  Limnaians  are  mentioned  in  Greek  inscriptions, but  normally  a  Limnaios  will  be  identified w ith  a  citizen  of  the  Thessalian  city Limnaion,  see  infra 679;  see  St\u00e4hlin  ( 1926);  Daux  ( 1955)  38;  SEG 15  340  and 19  379. Perhaps  other  Akarnanian  Matropolitai  are  mentioned  in  Greek  inscrip- tions,  but  normally  a  Matropolitas  will  be  identified w ith  a  citizen  of  the  homo- nym  Thessalian  city  (no. 403)  (cf.  e.g.  SEG 27  123.11;Daux  ( 1955)  37\u00ad38).The  same problem  concerns  the  coinage  of  Matropolis  (Isler  ( 1996)  170\u00ad71  n. 17).  This Matropolis  is  not  to  be  confused  with  the   \u00b5  mentioned by Thuc. 3.107.1  in  the  territory  of  Argos  Amphilochikon  (Pritchett  ( 1992) 25\u00ad27). 366 gehrke  and  wirbelauer *Matropolis  is  not  attested  as  a  polis  before  C 3,  when  the term  is  found  in  the  urban  sense  in  Polyb. 4.64.4  (r 219)  and in  the  political  sense  in  an  inscription  concerning  a  bound- ary  dispute  between  Oiniadai  (no. 130)  and  *Matropolis found  in  Aitolian  Thermos  (IG ix\u00b2.13B.8  (C 3)).  But  the  polis status  of  *Matropolis  in  the  Classical  period  is  strongly  indi- cated  by  the  toponym  itself,  the  coinage  of  C 4  (see  infra),  the membership  of  both  the  Aitolian  and  the  Akarnanian Confederacies  (see  infra),  and  the  existence  of  an  urban  centre  at  the  site  of  Palaiomanina  (identified c onvincingly with  *Matropolis  by  Pritchett  ( 1991)  8\u00ad15;  cf.  Freitag  ( 1994) 224  and  see  infra). In C 3s  *Matropolis  belonged  to  the  Stratos  district (  ) of the  Aitolian  Confederacy  (IG ix\u00b2.1 3B.2  (before  230);  cf.  Swoboda  ( 1913)  332\u00ad33  n. 6;  Klaffenbach ( 1957)  xx;  Guarducci,  EG ii  554;  Freitag  ( 1994)  223\u00ad24).  Later on,  it  is  attested  as  a  member  of  the  Akarnanian  koinon  (IG ix\u00b2.1  209,  208  and 588.11  (C 2);  cf.  IG ix.261.5  (Lamia, 216\u00ad212)),  part  of  which  it  must  have  been  before  the  Aitolian conquest  of  about  250  (IG ix\u00b2.13A;  cf.  Klaffenbach  ( 1957)  xx). *Matropolis  had  an  acropolis  ( ) as a part distinct from  the  city  (Polyb. 4.64.4).  The  site  of  Palaiomanina  fits very  well  the  Polybian  report,  which  is  decisive  for  the  ident- ification (Pritchett ( 1991)  11\u00ad12,  with  reference  to Kirsten). The  walls  of  the  acropolis,  in  trapezoidal  masonry,  are flanked w ith  towers,  while  the  enceinte  of  the  city  is  con- structed  of  polygonal  blocks  (for  a  description,  see  Pritchett ( 1991)  9\u00ad12,  who  reports  Geometric  pottery  and  metal objects  found  on  the  site:  ibid. 10). A  Pegasos-type  stater  of  Corinthian  standard  (obv. Pegasos;  rev.  head  of  Athena  with  Makedonian  shield  and monogram  ) has been attributed to *Matropolis (Imhoof-Blumer  ( 1878)  142\u00ad43;Head,  HN \u00b2  331).  Since  then eighteen  coins  of  this  type  have  been  found  in  Sicilian  and South  Italian  hoards  (Talbert  ( 1971)  62;  IGCH 2030,  2180, 2183,  2185,  2187;  Taliercio  Mensitieri  and  Spagnoli  ( 1993) especially  pls. 1,  3;  CH  viii. 167).  This  coinage  can  be  dated  to C 4s.  SNG  Cop.  Acarnania 399. 129. ", "Phara": "Identifier: 134. , Map 54.Lat.38.40,long.21.35.Size  of  territory: ?  Type:  A.

But  in  Ps.- Skylax,  Phara  is  listed  after  Leukas,  and  if  Phara  had  been  a polis  on  Leukas,  Ps.-Skylax  would  undoubtedly  have  classi- fied L eukas  as  a  dipolis  island.  Thus,  Phara  must  either  have been  one  of  the  small  islands  between  Leukas  and  Ithaka  or situated  on  the  coast  of  Akarnania  in  the  peraia  of  Leukas.  If we  accept  Ps.-Skylax's  text  as  it  stands,  Phara  must  be  classi- fied as an unlocated polis  in  Akarnania.

The  only  attestation  of  Phoitiai  as  a  polis  (in  the  urban sense)  is  at  Polyb. 4.63.7\u00ad9,  but  in  the  Delphic  naopoioi's accounts  of  C 4f  the  Phoitieis  are  recorded  under  the  head- ing     (CID ii  1.i.27  and ii.16).  It was  prob- ably  a  polis  already  in  C 5:  it  was  a  member  of  the  Akarnanian Confederacy  and  it  had  an  urban  centre  (see  infra). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally in  the  Delphic  accounts  (CID ii  1.ii.16  ( 362/1)).  The  individ- ual  use  is  attested  externally  in  a  proxeny  decree  of  Stratos (IG ix\u00b2.1  390.10  (C 5))  and  in  CID ii  1.ii.23  ( 362/1). The  territory  ( ,  Thuc. 3.106.2)  belonged  to  the Akarnanian  region,  according  to  the  theorodokoi  lists  (see infra).  The  eponym  of  Phoitiai  was  Phoitios,  son  of Alkmaion  and  grandson  of  Amphiaraos  (Steph.  Byz. 669.13\u00ad14). The  fact  that  a  Phoitian  is  attested  as  bolarchos  of  Stratos (no. 138)  in  a  proxeny  decree  of  C 5l  (IG ix\u00b2.1  390.9\u00ad10)  shows that  Phoitiai  was  either  a  civic  subdivision  of  Stratos  or  a dependent  polis.In 362/1  Phoitiai  and  Stratos  contributed jointly  to  the  Delphic  naopoioi's  fund  (CID ii  1.ii.16,  23), which  indicates  that  Phoitiai  was  (now?)  a  polis  side  by side with  Stratos  and  undoubtedly,  like  Stratos,  a  member  of  the Akarnanian  Confederacy.  Membership  is  explicitly  stated  in the  Aitolian\u00adAkarnanian  treaty  of  c. 263  (IG ix\u00b2.13A.23). Phoitiai  appointed  theorodokoi  to  host  theoroi  from Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.195.11  ( 356/5))  and  from  Nemea (SEG 36  331.A.47\u00ad48  ( 331/30\u00ad313)). Ruins  of  a  Doric  temple  are  visible  near  Vlyziana  (Kirsten ( 1941b)  440;  Philippson  and  Kirsten  ( 1958)  397;Schoch ( 1997)  57).  Phoitiai  is  commonly  located  at  the  site  of  the Porta  hills, 2  km  to  the  north  of  Bambini  (Pritchett  ( 1991) 4\u00ad7;  Schoch  ( 1997)  56\u00ad58).  There  one  can  find r emains  of two  acropoleis,  to  the  north  and  to  the  south  (Kirsten ( 1941b)  438\u00ad39),  and  a  circuit  of  walls  about  2.8  km  long, with  eighteen  (Noack)  or  eleven  (Kirsten)  towers,  mostly  of polygonal  masonry  (Noack  ( 1916)  217ff;  Kirsten  ( 1941b) 438\u00ad42;  Pritchett  ( 1991)  6\u00ad9).

Zakynthos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Xen.  Hell. 6.2.3  and  Ps.-Skylax  43.  Under  the  heading  , Zakynthos  is  listed  as  an  ally  of  Athens  (no. 361)  in  431  (Thuc. 2.9.1,  4)  and  in  373/2  as  a  member  of  the  Second  Athenian Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.32,  70,  78,B.35\u00ad38). The  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  an  Attic inscription  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.35)  and  in  the  authors  quoted  above, and  internally  on  the  coins  (see  infra).  The  individual  use  is attested  externally  in  various  inscriptions  (e.g.  SEG 40  507 (Michalitsi,  C 5\u00adC4);  IG v11457.7  (Messene,  C 4\u00adC3)). The  name  of  the  territory  is     (Thuc. 2.66.1).  There  was  a  place  occupied  by  democrats during  a  stasis  in 373/2  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.35;  cf.  Xen.  Hell. 6.2.2; Diod. 15.45.2  calls  it  ;  for  a  discussion,  see  Mitchel ( 1981)  73ff).  The  island  was  situated     (Strabo  2.5.20)  near  Elis  (no. 251)  (Thuc. 2.66.1;  cf. Strabo  8.2.2,  10.2.18,  17.3.20),  Kephallenia  (Diod. 16.6.5,  9.4) and  Ithaka  (no. 122)  (Heliod.  Aeth. 5.22.5).  Zakynthos formed  a  regional  unit  together  with  Korkyra  (no. 123), Kephallenia  and  Akarnania  (Thuc. 2.7.3). According  to  Thuc. 2.66,  Zakynthos  was  a  colony  of  the Achaians.  This  seems  not  implausible.  In  the  mythical  tradi- tion,  the  founder  of  the  city  was  Zakynthos,  son  of Dardanos,  from  Arkadian  Psophis  (no. 294;  Paus. 8.24.3), which  is  perhaps  spun  out  of  the  name  of  the  Zakynthian acropolis  (cf.  the  alternative  name  for ; see  supra).  Another  tradition  is  reflected in Dion.  Hal.  Ant. Rom. 1.50.3  and  Steph.  Byz. 294.3,  who  mentions  Bateia  as the  oecist  of  the  island. In 433,  1,000  Zakynthian  hoplites  joined  the  Korkyraians against  Corinth  (no. 227)  (Thuc. 1.47.2).  At  the  beginning  of the  Peloponnesian  War  ( 431),  Athens  sent  an  envoy  to Zakynthos  to  ascertain  the  Kephallenians'  loyalty  (Thuc. 2.7.3;  cf.  Diod. 12.43.5).  During  the  Peloponnesian  War, Zakynthos  was  allied  with  Athens  (e.g.  Thuc. 2.7.3,  9.4,  66;Ar. Lys. 394)  and  supported  the  Athenians  with  money,  infantry and  ships  (Thuc. 2.9.4\u00ad5,  3.94\u00ad95,  4.8.2\u00ad5,  4.13.2,  7.31.2,  57.7). After  the  Peloponnesian  War,  Zakynthos  became  oli- garchic.  At  the  beginning  of  C 4,  the  tyrant  Dionysios  of Syracuse  settled,  among  others, 600  Messenian  exiles  from Naupaktos  (no. 165)  and  Zakynthos  in  Sicilian  Messana  (no. 51)  (Diod. 14.78.5  (r 396)).  Probably  during  the  Corinthian War,  the  oligarchs  were  driven  out  of  Zakynthos  by  the  dem- ocratic  faction  (Diod. 15.45.2,  misplaced);  but  a  few  years later,  presumably  after  the  King's Peace  ( 386),  they  in  turn exiled  the  democrats.  These  democrats  were  brought  to by  the  Athenian  general  Timotheos  in  375.  They sided  with  the  Athenians,  while  the  oligarchs  in  the  town were  allied  with  Sparta  (no. 345),  sent  envoys  to Sparta,  and in 374  supported  the  Peloponnesian  fleet under M nasippos against  Korkyra  (Xen.  Hell. 6.2.2\u00ad3;Diod.  15.45.2\u00ad3;  IG ii\u00b2 43.B.37\u00ad38;Gehrke,  Stasis 198\u00ad99).  Zakynthos  entered  the Second  Athenian  Naval  League,  probably  in  373/2  (IG ii\u00b2 43.B.35\u00ad38  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 257;  cf.  Gehrke,  Stasis 198).  The island  was  the  base  for  Dion's  operations  before  his  return  to Sicily  (Plut.  Dio 22.8\u00ad25.2),  and  he  had  Zakynthian  mercen- aries  in  his  army  (Diod. 16.31.7;Plut.  Dio 57.2,  4  (r 357\u00ad354)). In 338/7  Zakynthos  became  a  member  of  the  Corinthian League  (IG ii\u00b2  236.b.12  (suppl.);  cf.  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 403). The  Zakynthian  Menalkos  was  appointed  proxenos  by  the Messenians  (IG v.11425  (C 4\u00adC3)).  A  Zakynthian  winner  is attested  for  an  unknown  Athenian  festival  (IG ii\u00b2  2312.7 (suppl.,  C 4f)). The  following  cult  sites  are  attested:  a  temple  of  Apollo (Plut.  Dio 23.3  (r 357))  and  a  temple  of  Aphrodite  (Dion.  Hal. Ant.  Rom. 1.50.3)  with  statues  of  Aphrodite  and  Aineias. Benton  ( 1932)  217  reports  traces  of  another  temple. There  existed  a  stadion  in  Zakynthos  (Plut.  Dio 23.4 (r 357))  and  a  harbour  (Ps.-Skylax  43),situated  near  the  town (Heliod.  Aeth. 5.18.3).The  name  of  the  acropolis  was   (Paus. 8.24.3;  Steph.  Byz. 705.4,  citing  Paus.). According  to  Strabo  3.4.6  and  App.  Hisp. 25,  Saguntum  in Spain  was  a  colony  of  Zakynthos,  but  that  seems  to  be derived  from  the  similarity  of  the  names  (cf.  SEG 42  972.2). Steph.  Byz.  ( 159.11\u00ad13)  calls  the  Libyan  city  of  Barka  a \u00b5     \u00b5 , obviously  a  mythographical  construction  possibly  connect- ed  with  Psophis,  which  is  attested  as  a  Libyan  polis  in  Steph. Byz. 705.2.  Hdt. 3.59  mentions  Zakynthians  in  Cretan Kydonia  (no. 968).  Their  relationship  to  the  inhabitants  of our  island  is  not  clear. 374 gehrke  and  wirbelauer From C 5  onward,  Zakynthos  struck  silver  \"drachms  and smaller  fractions  with  the  type  of  a  tripod,  thus  initiating  the Apolline  theme  which  was  to  remain  prominent  throughout Zacynthian  coinage\"  (Kraay  ( 1976)  96).

Alyzeia  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skylax  34. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in a  decree  from  Thebes  (no. 221)  (IG vii  2418.5,  16,  18 ( 355\u00ad351))  and  internally  on  coins  (see  infra)  and  on  an undated  tile  stamp  (IG ix\u00b2.1450);  the  individual  use  is  attest- ed  externally  in  two  inscriptions  from  Dodona  (SEG 15  395 (C 5\u00adC4))  and  Ephesos  (SEG 42  1041  (C 4)). Whether  Alyzeia  was  founded  by  Corinth  (no. 227)  is  dis- puted  (for  a  discussion,  see  Domingo-Forast\u00e9  ( 1988)  23\u00ad25; Schoch  ( 1997)  33).  According  to  ancient  tradition,  the eponymous  hero  of  the  polis  was  Alyzeus,  son  of  Penelope's father  Ikarios  and  brother  of  Leukadios  (Alkmaionis  fr. 5, Bernab\u00e9;  Ephor.  fr. 124;Strabo 10.2.9). Alyzeia  was  a  member  of  the  Akarnanian  Confederacy (SEG 42  1041;  cf.  IG ix\u00b2.1582.49  (c. 207)),  during  the  Third Sacred  War  allied  with  Thebes  (no. 221)  (IG vii  2418),  and  a member  of  the  Hellenic  League  of 323  (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 413). In 413  slingers  and  javelin-throwers  from  Alyzeia  were  raised by  the  Athenians  (Thuc. 7.31.2,  5).  An Athenian  honorific decree  of  C 4s  may  have  bestowed  proxenia  on  a  citizen  of Alyzeia  (SEG 21  340.7\u00ad8:  ...    [   ]; cf.

The  urban  centre  lay  at  a  distance  of 15  stades  from  the  sea, the  important  harbour  and  precinct  of  Herakles  at  modern Mytikas  (Strabo  10.2.21;  Murray  ( 1982)  114\u00ad21). Alyzeia  must  have  been  fortified before  391  (ibid. 112\u00ad13). There  are  remains  of  the  circuit  walls  2.3  km  long  (apart from  the  southern  wall,  which  has  almost  completely  disap- peared),  with  twenty-four  towers,  mostly  of  polygonal  con- struction  (ibid. 106\u00ad13),  and  a  fortified acropolis at the north-east  extremity  of  the  city  (ibid. 110\u00ad11).  The  walls enclosed  an  area  of 27  ha. Alyzeia  struck  coins  between  350  and 330  (BMC  Corinth, lviii,  with  reference  to Imhoof-Blumer  ( 1878)  47;Head,  HN \u00b2 329).

Palairos  is  not  attested  as  a  polis  before  the  Hellenistic period  unless  one  accepts  a  conjecture  in  the  text  of  Ps.- Skylax 34:  the  MS  has  an  otherwise  unknown  polis  listed  between  Leukas  (no. 126)  and  Alyzeia  and  situated opposite  Ithaka  (and  Kephallenia);  instead  of , Wirbelauer  ( 1998)  221\u00ad22  conjectures  .  Palairos was  probably  a  polis  already  in  C 5:  it  was  a  member  of  the Akarnanian  Confederacy,  it  had  an  urban  centre,  and  it seems  to  have  struck  coins  (see  infra).  Palairos  is  called  a polis  in  two  inscriptions  of  C 2\u00adC1  (SEG 27  156,  157). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally in  an  inscription  from  Kyrene  (SEG 92.35  Tod 196 ( 330\u00ad326))  as  well  as  by  Thuc. 2.30.1  and  internally  in  two mutilated  honorific  inscriptions  (SEG 27  156,  157  (C 2\u00adC1)). The  external  and  individual  use  is  attested  in  the  feminine form  on  a  grave  stele: (IG ix\u00b2.1  379.2  (undat- ed)). Palairos  was  situated  on  the  Plagia  peninsula  and  bor- dered  to  the  west  on  the  Leukadian  peraia  (Wacker  ( 1999)). In 431  the  Corinthian  polisma  Sollion  (no. 137)  on  the  south- ern  side  of  the  peninsula  (supra)  was  given  to  Palairos  by  the Athenians  (Thuc. 2.30.1). c. 330\u00ad325,  the  polis  received 10,000  medimnoi  of  grain from  Kyrene  (no. 1028)  (SEG 92.35  Tod 196). 368 gehrke  and  wirbelauer Palairos  was  part  of  Akarnania  according  to  the  theo- rodokoi  lists  (see  infra).  The  earliest  explicit  attestation  of Palairos  as  a  member  of  the  Akarnanian  Confederacy  is  of C 3l  (IG ix\u00b2.1582  (Magnesia,  c. 207);  cf.  IG ix\u00b2.13A),  but  the  addition  of to  the  city-ethnic  found  both  in Thuc. 2.30.1  (    ) and in the Kyrenaian  grain  inscription  (SEG 92.35  Tod 196 ( 330\u00ad326):  ) is a very strong  indication  that  Palairos  was  a  member  from  C 5  onwards. Palairos  appointed  theorodokoi  to  host  theoroi  from  Argos (no. 347)  (SEG 23  189.i.5  ( 330\u00ad324)),  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.195.21  ( 356/5))  and  Nemea  (SEG 36  331.A.16\u00ad19 ( 331/30\u00ad313)). The  agora  of  Palairos  with  public  buildings  was  possibly situated  in  the  northern  part  of  the  upper  city  (Wacker ( 1996b)  94).  Several  cults  of  different  deities  are  attested  for Palairos  but  cannot  be  connected  with  existing  remains. Outside  the  city,  on  the  mountain  Profitis Ilias,  was  a  C 4 extra-urban  sanctuary  (Faisst  and  Kolonas  ( 1990)).  On  the way  to  this  site,  about  100  m  from  the  north-western  corner of  the  city  wall,  a  shrine  of  Artemis  has  been  located  (Camp ( 1977)  280\u00ad81;  Wacker  ( 1996b)  97\u00ad98).  To the  south-west  of Profitis Ilias,  on  the  summit  of  the  mountain  Sterna  above the  old  village  of  Plagia,  there  are  impressive remains  of what  must  have  been  a  fortified sanctuary c ontrolled  by Palairos  (according  to  unpublished  tile  stamps:  information from  E.-L.  Schwandner);  other  references  concerning  the site  are  given  by  Pritchett  ( 1994)  205\u00ad7,  who  identifies it erroneously  with  Sollion  (no. 137)  (see  supra). There  are  virtually  no  traces  left  of  walls  or  public  archi- tecture  on  the  acropolis  of  Palairos,  situated  on  the  eastern summit  of  the  upper  city  (Kirsten  ( 1942)  2458).  The  acro- polis  and  lower  town  were  fortified.  The  existing  circuit  of walls  of  cyclopean,  polygonal  and  horizontal  masonry  was not  erected  as  late  as  C 3,  as  suggested  by Kirsten,  but  most likely  in  C 5;see Murray ( 1982)  145;  Pritchett  ( 1992)  115\u00ad19. Wacker ( 1999)  81\u00ad90  gives  a  description  of  the  different phases  of  the  construction  of  the  walls.  In  the  whole  area  of the  city,  remains  of  houses  are  visible,  in  the  western  part  of the  upper  city  in  an  orthogonal  structure  (Wacker  ( 1996b) 94;  cf.  Lang  ( 1994)  243).

Another  version  of  the  early  settlement  pat- tern  may  be  inferred  from  Strabo  ( 9.1.10),  where  he  reports that  the  Megarians  interpolated  a  passage  in  Homer's  Iliad linking  Salamis  with  Polichna,  Aigiroussa,  Nisaia  and Tripodes,  to prove  the  pre-Dorian  antiquity  of  their  claim  to Salamis.  The  implication  is  that  the  latter  four  places  were  all within  Megarian  territory.  Rigsby  ( 1987)  98\u00ad102  argues  that this  couplet  presents  a  more  accurate  picture  of  the  Megarid in  the  Dark  Ages  than  does  Plutarch's  testimony.  Synoecism appears  to  have  occurred  in  C 8  through  the  union  of  five komai,  including  the  kome  of  Megara (Plut.  Quaest.  Graec. 17;  cf.  Moggi,  Sin. 29\u00ad34). Attested  place-names  in  the  Megarid  include  Aigiros, perhaps  in  the  region  of  Vathikhoria,  based  on  the  incident  of the  \"waggon-rollers\"  (Plut.  Quaest.  Graec. 59);  Aigosthena (no. 224),  in  C 4  a  kome  of  Megara (IG vii  1.19)  and  possibly  a dependent  polis  of  Megara  as  well  (supra);  Eirenea,  a  village (Paus. 7.22.8);  Kynosoura,  Archaic\u00adClassical  evidence  is  lack- ing,  but  a  C 3  inscription  (IG iv\u00b2.142)  refers  to the  hekatostyes of  Kynosoura  (see  Legon  ( 1981)  53  and  nn. 23  and 32);  Nisaia, the  Saronic  Gulf  port  of  Megara  (Thuc. 4.69;  Paus. 1.39.4) associated  with  the  island  or  promontory  of  Minoa  (Thuc. 4.67;  Paus. 1.44.3;Legon ( 1981)  29\u00ad32);  Pagai  (no. 226)  (IG i\u00b3 1353.5  (C 5m))  was  possibly  a  dependent  polis  of  Megara by C 4 (infra);  Panormos,  a  harbour  between  Pagai  and  Aigosthena (Paus. 7.22.10);  and  Tripodiskos,  tentatively  identified in a central  depression  of  Mt.  Gerania,  near  the  western  edge  of the  Megarian  plain  (Thuc. 4.70.1;Paus.  1.43.8;Plut.  Quaest. Graec. 17;  Nicopoulou  ( 1969),  ( 1970);  and  Rigsby  ( 1987)). Megara's  estimated  peak  population  (C 5)  was  40,000, including 15,000  slaves  and  free  non-citizens  (Legon  ( 1981) 23\u00ad24,  167\u00ad68,  258\u00ad59,  268\u00ad71). Megara  is  attested  as  a  member  of  the  Peloponnesian League  in  C 5e  (e.g.  Thuc. 1.103.4),  probably  having  accepted the  obligatory  bilateral  alliance  with  Sparta  (no. 345)  in  C 6l at  approximately  the  same  time  as  Corinth  (no. 227)  (see Legon ( 1981)  143\u00ad45).  Megara  broke  away  from  the Peloponnesian  League  to  become  an  ally  of  Athens  (no. 361) in 461,  but  returned  to  the  League  in  448  (Thuc. 1.103.3\u00ad114; cf.  Diod. 11.79  and 12.5).  In  C 4  and  beyond  Megara  frequent- ly  shifted  allegiance  and  attempted  to  maintain  neutrality among  its  larger  neighbours  and  more  distant  powers (Legon  ( 1981)  257\u00ad79,  285\u00ad95,  299\u00ad303). megaris,  corinthia,  sikyonia  463 Megara  awarded  proxenia  to  citizens  of,  e.g.,  Argos  (no. 347)  (IG vii  2  (C 4l)),  and  Megarian  citizens  were  appointed proxenoi  by  Athens  (no. 361)  in  C 4f(SEG  40  57)  and  by Delphi  (no. 177)  in  320\u00ad310  (F.Delphes iii.1  161).  A  citizen  of Megara  served  as  Epidaurian  theorodokos  in 360/59  (IG iv\u00b2.1 94.ia.2). Megara mustered  3,000  hoplite  troops  at  full  mobilisa- tion  during  the  C 5e  battles  of  the  Persian  Wars  (Hdt. 9.28.6, 31.5),  but  less  than  half  this  number  under  similar  circum- stances  in  C 4e  (Legon  ( 1981)  268\u00ad71,  based  on  Diod. 15.31 and  Xen.  Hell. 5.2.11\u00ad22).  Six  strategoi  are  attested  in  C 4s  (IG vii  1\u00ad7;  cf.  Heath  ( 1912\u00ad13)).  Naval  power  is  attested  for Megara  as  early  as  its  C 7l  sea  battle  with  Samos  (no. 864) (Plut.  Quaest.  Graec. 57).  Megara  contributed  twenty triremes  to  the  Greek  fleets at A rtemision  (Hdt. 8.1.1)  and Salamis  (Hdt. 8.45). The  Megarians  maintained  that  citizenship  had  been granted  to  only  two  non-Megarians:  the  hero  Herakles  and Alexander  the  Great  (Plut.  Mor. 826C).  The  denial  of  citi- zenship  to  Hermon  the  metic  is  recorded  by  Dem. 23.212,but see  Paus. 10.9.4.  For  Athenians  living  as  metics  in  Megara, see  also  Dem. 29.3;  Lycurg 1.21;Plut.  Mor. 605D.  A  casualty list  of  c. 425\u00ad400  (SEG 39  411)  attests  to  a  group  of (l. 22),  i.e.  free  non-citizens. The  existence  of  the  three  Dorian  phylai  at  Classical Megara  is  attested  by  SEG 39  411,  a  casualty  list  of  c. 425\u00ad400 listing  the  fallen  soldiers  under  the  rubrics  ~,etc.  A hekatostys  is  attested  in  C 3s  (IG iv\u00b2.142.18\u00ad21),  but  evidence from  Megarian  colonies  (infra)  suggests  that  such  units existed  at  a  much  earlier  date  (Jones,  POAG 94).  Plut.  Mor. 295B  reports  the  early  existence  of  five k omai  ( `, ,  ,  ,  ) in Megaris,  and  one  of  these,  Tripodiskos,  is  called  a  kome  at Thuc. 4.70.1  as  well.  There  is  no  compelling  evidence  that these  komai  functioned  as  civic  subdivisions  or  as  units  of public  organisation  (Jones,  POAG 95\u00ad96;  Hansen  ( 1995) 72\u00ad73),  though  it  is  worth  noting  that  the  C 6\u00adC5  poet Sousarion  refers  to  himself  as  a  (fr. 1,  West). The  Megarian  constitution  was  oligarchic  for  most  of  the period  between  C 7  and  C 5,  briefly interrupted b y  the  tyran- ny  of  Theagenes  in  C 7s  (Thuc. 1.126;  Arist.  Pol. 1305a,  Rh. 1357b;Plut.  Quaest.  Graec. 18;  Paus. 1.40.1,  41.2)  and  by  the \"unbridled  democracy\"  in  C 6e  (Arist.  Pol. 1300a15\u00ad19, 1302b31\u00ad32,  1304b35\u00ad40;Plut.  Quaest.  Graec. 18  and 59). Legon ( 1981)  105\u00ad19  argues  that  much  of  the  Theognidea,  e.g. 43\u00ad48,  43\u00ad60  and 182\u00ad92,  also  refers  to  the  latter  regime;  cf. Robinson  ( 1997)  114\u00ad17.  A democratic  faction  seized  power in 427  and  had  the  leading  oligarchs  exiled.  Renewed  stasis  in 424,  however,  resulted  in  the  Athenian  conquest  of  Nisaia and  the  long  walls,  whereupon  the  Megarians  opened  their gates  to  the  Lakedaimonians  under  Brasidas.  A  radical  oli- garchic  constitution  was  introduced,  and,  of  the  leaders  of the  democratic  faction,  some  went  into  exile  while  others were executed (Thuc. 3.68.3,4.66\u00ad74;Gehrke,Stasis  106\u00ad10). This  oligarchy  was  still  in  power  in  C 4e  (Thuc. 4.74.3,  cf. 5.31.6;Dem.  18.96).  Diod. 15.40.4  reports  an  attempted  coup that  was  defeated  by  the  demos  in 375,  though  it  is  more  like- ly  to  have  occurred  in  369  after  Leuktra (Legon  ( 1981) 276\u00ad78).  C. 343  an  attempt  to introduce  a  pro-Makedonian faction  into  power  was  reported  to  Athens  and  thwarted  by an  Athenian  relieving  force  under  Phokion  that  fortified Nisaia  and  reconstructed  Megara's  long  walls  from  the  city to  Nisaia  (Dem. 19.294\u00ad95;Plut.  Phoc. 15.1;  cf.  Legon  ( 1981) 289\u00ad94). The  institution  of  ostracism  is  reported  by  schol.  Ar.  Eq. 855  ( ...  ),a report now sup- ported  by  the  finding of  an  inscribed  C 5l\u00adC4e  ostrakon  at Megara  (Kritzas  ( 1987)).  Decrees  of  C 4l  show  that  decisions were  made  by  the  boule  and  the  demos  in  accordance  with  a probouleumatic  procedure  (IG vii  1\u00ad14;  Rhodes,  DGS 109\u00ad12),  but  these  decrees  reflect the c onstitution  after  307. Other  institutions  known  from  C 4  and  later  sources  include a  high  court,  \"the  three  hundred\"  (Dem. 19.295),  the  aisym- natai  (IG vii  15),  five demiourgoi  in  C 4  (IG vii  41)  and  five polemarchoi  in  C 3  (IG vii  27\u00ad28).A  basileus  is  attested  as  the eponymous  official ( IG vii  1\u00ad14);  cf.  a  grammateus  boulas  kai demou  (IG vii  1\u00ad14);  a  grammateus  tou  damou  (IG vii  29); and  a  grammateus  ton  synhedron  (IG vii  31). The  town  centres  on  the  twin  hills  of  Karia  and  Alkathoa, both  under  300  m  (Threpsiades  and  Travlos  ( 1934)  and ( 1936),  which  are  encircled  by  a  3.5  km  perimeter  wall  (of C 4?)  enclosing  an  area  of 140  ha  (Alexandris  ( 1970)).  Long walls  from  the  perimeter  wall  to  the  port  of  Nisaia,  approxi- mately  1.5  km  distant,  were  built  in  C 5m  (Thuc. 1.103.4), destroyed  in  424/3  (Thuc. 4.109.1),  and  briefly r ebuilt  in C 4m  (Plut.  Phoc. 15);  a  section  of  the  long  walls  has  been uncovered;  see  P.  Zoridis  in  ArchDelt 38  Chron. 1983  ( 1989) 39\u00ad40  with  plate  22B;  cf.  AR  ( 1990\u00ad91)  12. The  site  and  main  physical  features  of  the  town  of  Megara are  well  known.  Excavations  have  identified the agora,  stoas, major  arteries  and  portions  of  the  circuit  wall  (Threpsiades and  Travlos  ( 1936)).  The  fountain  house  of  Theagenes  (C 6) is  Megara's  most  famous  surviving  monument  (Gruben ( 1964)).  The  divinities  honoured  include  Apollo,  Artemis, Athena,  Demeter,  Dionysos  and  Zeus  (Paus. 1.39\u00ad44;  Hanell 464 legon ( 1934)).  The  principal  divinity  was  Apollo  Pythios  (Paus. 1.42.5;  Syll. \u00b3653.22  (C 2);  Meyer  ( 1931)  201\u00ad2).  On  Alkathoa have been  found  the  remains  of  a  temple  of  Athena  (Lauffer ( 1989)  415). Orsippos  was  victor  at  Olympia  in  720  (IG vii  52;  Paus. 1.44.1  Olympionikai 16;  cf.  nos. 23,  48,  49,  468).A  Megarian treasury  was  built  at  Olympia  in  C 6l\u00adC5e  (Paus. 6.19.12\u00ad14; Bol  ( 1974))  and  one  at  Delphi  in  C 5\u00adC4  (Bommelaer  ( 1991) 126\u00ad28).In  C 4l  the  trumpeter  Herodoros  of  Megara  won  the prize  in  all  the  four  major  Panhellenic  games,  ten  times according  Ath. 414F\u00ad415A,  seventeen  times  according  to Poll. 4.89\u00ad90);  Ath.  probably  refers  to the  Olympia  and Pythia,  Poll.  to  the  Isthmia  and  Nemea.  From  the  time  of  the First  Sacred  War  in  C 6e,  Megara  seems  to  have  been  fre- quently  at  odds  with  Delphi  (no. 177)  over  the  question  of tolls  levied  on  pilgrims  to  the  sanctuary,  and  to  have  been involved  in  territorial  disputes  with  its  neighbours,  Athens (no. 361)  and  Corinth  (no. 227)  (see  Legon  ( 1981)  for  details). The  Megarians  dedicated  a  statue  of  Apollo  at  Delphi  in C 5m  for  a  victory  over  the  Athenians  at  Nisaia  (Paus. 10.15.1); cf.  MEFR  ( 1983)  631,  1.1.  In  C 4m  Megara  contributed  money to  the  rebuilding  of  Apollo's  temple  at  Delphi  after  its  col- lapse  in  369  (CID ii  4.i.6,  ii.55  ( 360)),  and  Megarians  appear among  the  naopoioi  (CID ii  31.34  ( 354/3,  etc.)). Megara  may  have  minted  the  disputed  C 6  \"waggon wheel\"  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2393),  but  its  first authenticated coinage  is  dated  to  C 4:  obv.  head  of  Apollo;  rev.  Apollo's  lyre. Legend: on  the  didrachm, and  on  smaller  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2329\u00ad30;  SNG  Cop.  Attica- Aegina 459\u00ad65). Megara  was  an  active  coloniser  from  C 8s  to  C 7m,  found- ing  Megara  Hyblaia  (no. 36),  one  of  the  earliest  Sicilian colonies  c. 750  (Thuc. 6.2.2;Strabo 5.270\u00ad82;  Hellan.  fr. 82;  cf. Vallet  and  Villard  ( 1952)  for  discussion  of  literary  and archaeological  evidence).  Megara  also  sent  the  oecist Pammilos  for  Selinous  (no. 44)  in  Sicily  in  C 7m  (Thuc. 6.4.2),  but  concentrated  its  further  colonising  activities  in the  Hellespontine  and  Black  Sea  regions.  Megara  was  prin- cipal  or  sole  founder  of  Kalchedon  (no. 743)  c. 675  (Thuc. 4.75.2;Strabo 12.4.2;Pompon.  1.101),  Selymbria  (no. 679) c. 660  (Ps.-Skymnos  715\u00ad16),  Byzantion  (no. 674)  c. 658  (Hdt. 4.144.2;  Hsch.  Patria  Constantinoupoleos 5.3),  Astakos  (no. 737)  (Memnon  (FGrHist 434)  fr. 12),  Herakleia  Pontike  (no. 715)  in  C 6m  (Paus. 5.26.7)  and  possibly  Olbia  (no. 753).Since Megara  was  not  a  major  factor  in  later  Greek  history,  many of  its  early  foundations  were  disputed  in  late  sources.  See Hanell  ( 1934),  esp. 161\u00ad204,  for  cult  and  calendar  evidence that  confirms M egarian  influence in the c olonies. 226. ", "Aigosthena": "Identifier: 225. , (Aigosthenitas)  Map  58.

The  city-ethnic  is (IG vii  1.5  (c. 300);  43.2  (C 3))  or  ' (IG vii  207.4  (C 3s)). Aigosthena  was  situated  in  the  territory  of  Megara  (Xen. Hell. 5.4.18:      ;  cf. 6.4.26).  In a  difficult c hapter,  Ps.-Skylax  39  (on  which  see  Flensted- Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  142\u00ad43)  refers  to a  plurality  of poleis  in  Megaris  under  the  heading   ,  and  the toponym Aigosthena  has  been  plausibly  restored  from  the MS  reading  which  follows  this  heading;  accept- ing  this,  Aigosthena  is  here  listed  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense in  a  C 4  source.  C 3  sources  use  polis  in  the  political  sense about  the  city  (IG vii  207.4,  10  (C 3s);  208.19,  21;  213.10,  219.5 (C 3s\u00adC2e))  and  in  C 3s  a  citizen  of  Aigosthena  served  as actionGoTo:7,MEGARIS,  actionGoTo:7,CORINTHIA  actionGoTo:7,AND   actionGoTo:7,SIKYONIA actionGoTo:7,ronald p. legon Delphic  theorodokos  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  ii.28).This  suggests  that Aigosthena  may  in  fact  have  been  a  polis  by C 4,  as  indicated by  Ps.-Skylax.  However,  an  inscription  of  c. 300  describes Aigosthena  as  a  kome  of  Megara (IG vii  1.19),  so  the  city  may have  had  a  double  status  as  both  a  kome  and  a  polis,  and  in this  case  a  dependent  polis  within  the  territory  of  Megara (Hansen  ( 1995)  74\u00ad75);  alternatively,  the  city  developed  into a  polis  only  in  the  Hellenistic  period.

Il. 2.656)  or  (Diod. 5.59.3); \u00b5  is  found  in  Hom.  Il. 2.656  and  Thuc. 8.44.2; \u00b5,  is  found  in  Dieuchidas  (FGrHist 485)  fr. 7,pos- sibly  as  the  name  of  the  territory.  The  city-ethnic  is \u00b5  (C 5  coins  (infra);  IG i\u00b3  269.iv.11  ( 443/2))  or \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  290.i.10  ( 415/14)); \u00b5  is  found  in Diod. 5.55.2. Kamiros  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Thuc. 8.44.2;  Ps.-Skylax 99)  and  in  the  political  sense  (Hdt. 1.144.3).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  inter- nally  on  C 5  coins  (infra)  and  in  Tit.  Cam. 105.7  (C 4f),  and externally  in  IG i\u00b3  269.iv.11  ( 443/2).  For  the  individual  and external  use,  see  Peisandros,  an  epic  poet  of  C 7\u00adC6,men- tioned  by  schol.  Pind.  Ol. 3.50b  and  Paus. 2.37.4. The  name  of  the  territory  was  \u00b5  (Dieuchidas (FGrHist 485)  fr. 7);  it  measured  c. 265  km \u00b2.  Apart  from  the Classical  settlement  at  Kymisala  in  the  western  extremity  of the  territory  (Maiuri  ( 1916);  Hope  Simpson  and  Lazenby ( 1973)  146),  no  second-order  settlement  has  been  located, but  various  cemeteries  are  dispersed  in  the  vicinity  of Kamiros  town,  and  they  suggest  that  such  settlements  may have  existed.  The  most  significant of  these  cemeteries  is  at the  locality  Makri  Longoni  by  the  sea;  here  260  tombs  dating from  C 7  to C 6  have  been  excavated  (Jacopi  ( 1929\u00ad30)  esp. 10 and  fig. 3;  Gates  ( 1983)  21\u00ad22);  this  site  may  have  formed  a part  of  the  city  of  Kamiros  proper.  Kamiran  authority extended  beyond  the  territory  on  the  island  itself:  ( 1)  in addition  to  the  islets  near  the  coast,  Kamiros  had  by  C 4l incorporated  the  island  of  Chalke;  in  C 4m,  Chalke  appears as  a  community,  probably  a  polis  (no. 477),  concluding  what was  presumably  a  treaty  of  isopoliteia  with  Knidos  (no. 903) (I.Knidos 605;  cf.  Gawantka  ( 1975)  209  n. 11  and 38  n. 79), whereas  in  Theophr.  Hist.  pl. 8.2.9  it  is  called  a   `  and  had  become  a  Kamiran  deme,  though  appar- ently  one  with  a  certain  degree  of  independence  (Tit.  Cam. 109  (C 4l));  ( 2)  Kamiran  territory,  subdivided  into  demes, existed  by  C 4l  in  the  peraia  (Tit.  Cam. 109.1\u00ad5). With  Halikarnassos  (no. 886),  Kos  (no. 499),  Knidos  (no. 903),Ialysos  (no. 995)  and  Lindos  (no. 997),Kamiros  formed the  so-called  Dorian  hexapolis,  later  pentapolis,  a  cultic  asso- ciation  centred  on  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo  at  Triopion  near Knidos  (Hdt. 1.144). Kamiros  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League,  and  was probably  among  the  original  members  (ATL  iii. 213). Kamiros  belonged  to  the  Karian  district  (IG i\u00b3  271.ii.69)  and is  registered  in  the  tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.8)  to 415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.i.10)  a  total  of  sixteen  times,  twice  com- pletely  restored.  Kamiros  initially  paid  a  phoros  of 9  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.8,262.ii.15,263.i.13,265.i.9);  in  443/2  the  phoros  paid 1200 nielsen  and  gabrielsen was 6  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  269.iv.11),  and  so  it  remained  (cf.  IG i\u00b3 271.ii.69,  280.i.48)  until  10  tal.  was  paid  in  416/15  (IG i\u00b3 289.i.34).  Kamiros  was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4 (IG i\u00b3  71.i.123). In 412/11  a  Peloponnesian  squadron  arrived  at  Rhodos invited  by  some  wealthy  Rhodians  (Thuc. 8.44.1);  as  a  result, Kamiros  (with  Ialysos  and  Lindos)  defected  from  the Athenians  and  joined  the  Peloponnesians  in  the  war  against Athens  (Thuc. 8.44.2).Thuc.8.44.4  records  a  payment  by  the Rhodians  to  the  Peloponnesians  of 32  tal.,  but  the  share  con- tributed  by  Kamiros  to  this  amount  is  not  known.  An attempt  to  undo  the  new  alliance  with  the  Lakedaimonians shortly  after  was  quelled  by  a  squadron  commanded  by  the Ialysian  exile  Dorieus  (Diod. 13.38.5,  45.1;Gehrke,  Stasis 133\u00ad34).  The  presumption  is  that  in  411  a  democratic  consti- tution  was  replaced  by  an  oligarchy  and  that  the  following neoterismos  (Diod.)  was  an  attempt  to  bring  the  democrats back  into  power. According  to Diod. 13.75.1,in  408  the  inhabitants  of Kamiros  (and  Ialysos  and  Lindos)  \u00b5  \u00b5    \u00b5 `,  a  process  which Strabo  14.2.10  refers  to by the  verb .  As  in numerous  other  cases,  only  part  of  the  population  was transferred  to  the  new  urban  centre,  and  it  is  clear  that  a wholesale  relocation  of  the  Kamiran  population  was  not carried  out  (Gabrielsen  ( 2000b)  188\u00ad89).  Furthermore, there  appears  to  be  no  good  reason  for  the  idea  that  the foundation  of  Rhodos  town  was  accompanied  by  a  funda- mental  restructuring  of  the  political  organisation  of  the island  (ibid. 189\u00ad90):  the  move  towards  pan-Rhodian  unity had  begun  long  before 408  (ibid. 180\u00ad87),  and  the  three  old poleis  continued  to  exist  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.25;  Ps.-Skylax 99) and  function  as  poleis  after 408:  council,  assembly  and  offi- cials  are  attested  in  Kamiros  in  C 4f(Tit.  Cam. 106;  cf. Gabrielsen  ( 2000b)  192\u00ad95),  and  the  civic  mint  may  have continued  to  function  somewhat  beyond  408  (Babelon, Trait\u00e9  ii. 2.  1008  ad  no. 1681).  However,  Kamiros  was  now  a subordinate  polis  inside  the  polis  of  Rhodos  (no. 1000),  and constituted  a  phyle  ( \u00b5;  Tit.  Cam. 21.6  (C 2))  of  the Rhodian  polis;  see  Jones,  POAG 243\u00ad44. The  existence  of  a  Kamiran  navy  may  be  inferred  from Diod. 13.70.2  (r 408)  (Gabrielsen  ( 2000b)  182). By C 4l,  Kamiros  had  a  system  of  territorial  demes  sub- divided  into  ktoinai,  and  demotics  were  used  as  the  third part  of  a  citizen's  name  (Tit.  Cam. 110.1\u00ad2  (C 2);  see  further Gabrielsen  ( 1997)  29\u00ad31,  151\u00ad54);  a  system  of  patrai  may  also go  back  to C 4  (ibid. 146\u00ad49).  A  number  of  local  Kamiran phylai  (of  which  the  name  of  one  (Althaimenis)  is  attested  in C 3e)  in  all  likelihood  also  go  back  to  the  Classical  period (Tit.  Cam. 1b.10;  Gabrielsen  ( 1997)  146).However,nothing  is known  about  the  functions  of  these  various  divisions. The  eponymous  official was a damiourgos  (Tit.  Cam. 105 (C 4f);  Sherk  ( 1990)  280).  The  council,  called   \u00b5  ,is attested  in  Tit.  Cam. 105.6  (C 4f),  restored.  The  office of  pry- tanis  is  attested  in  a  C 5  inscription  (Tit.  Cam. 103);  he  seems inter  al.  to  have  been  in  charge  of  the  construction  of  a  pub- lic  building  ( ).  A  board  of  hiaropoioi  and  a tamias  are  attested  by  Tit.  Cam. 104  (C 4);  a  board  of  epistatai is  attested  by  Tit.  Cam. 105.6  (C 4f).  The  assembly,  called ,  is  attested  in  Tit.  Cam. 105.26\u00ad27  (C 4f).  A C 5 enactment  records  a  grant  of  ateleia  (Tit.  Cam. 103.3).  A public  loan  contracted  by the  polis  possibly  as  early  as  C 5m is  attested  by  Tit.  Cam. 105  (C 4f). According  to  Thuc. 8.44.2,  Kamiros  was  unwalled  (ate- ichistos)  in  412/11,and  it  may  have  remained  unfortified until the  Hellenistic  period  (cf.  Tit.  Cam. 110.19ff  (C 2)).  The  town of  Kamiros  has  been  partially  excavated.  The  areas  known consist  of  three  parts:  a  public  area  (agora),  the  residential area  and  the  acropolis.  In  its  present  form,  almost  the  entire public  area  dates  to  the  Hellenistic  period  or  later;  however, the  monumental  fountain  house  in  the  midst  of  the  agora may  have  a  Classical  predecessor;  a  sanctuary  of  Apollo Pythios  has  produced  Archaic  and  Classical  finds (Konstantinopoulos  ( 1986)  173,  175\u00ad76).  The  few  pre- Hellenistic  remains  of  the  residential  area  indicate  a  rather unplanned  urban  area  (ibid. 172\u00ad73).  Right  above  the  resi- dential  area  is  the  Kamiran  acropolis,  on  which  the  temple  of Athena  Polias  and  Zeus  Polieus  was  situated:  in  its  present form  the  temple  (a  Doric  tetrastyle  with  east\u00adwest  orienta- tion)  is  of  Hellenistic  date;  however,  the  existence  of  a  predecessor  is  indicated  by  various  remains  of  the  Archaic and  Classical  periods  (Jacopi  ( 1932\u00ad33)  223\u00ad29).  A  large  rec- tangular  cistern  ( 17.40 10.20 3.2  m)  from  the  Archaic period  was  positioned  in  an  east\u00adwest  orientation  immedi- ately  to  the  south  of  the  temple;  its  capacity  was  600  m \u00b3 (ibid. 229).  At  a  distance  of  c. 300  m  from  the  city  is  a  small coastal  settlement  whose  origin  dates  to  the  Archaic  period and  which  is  believed  to  have  been  the  port  of  Kamiros;  it  is situated  at  the  promontory  Mylantia  Akra  in  the  area  of modern  Ag.  Menas;  about  halfway  between  this  site  and  the town  are  the  remains  of  a  possibly  Archaic  temple  and  other buildings  (Konstantinopoulos  ( 1971)  42). Attested  cults  include  those  of  Athena  (Tit.  Cam. 104.3, 109.10  (C 4)),  Athena  Polias  (Tit.  Cam. 148  (C 3)),  Zeus Polieus  (Tit.  Cam. 15.8  (C 3f))  and  Apollo  (Suppl.  Tit.  Cam. 115a  (C 6)). rhodos  1201 Kamiros  began  striking  anepigraphic  electrum  and  silver coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard  in  C 6.

In  C 5,  silver  and  bronze  coins  were struck. Denominations:  stater,  trihemiobol,  obol.  Silver  types:  obv. fig leaf;  rev.  two  oblong  incuses,  on  staters  separated  by  a broad  band;  legends: ,  (stater,  tri- hemiobol);  or  obv.  rose;  rev.  griffin's hed in incuse square; legend: (obol).  Bronze  types:  obv.  fig leaf;  rev. in two  quarters  of  a  wheel.  Some  minor  silver  fractions  struck after  479  depict  obv.  forepart  of  horse;  rev.  fig leaf  in  incuse square;  legends: ,  ;  a similar  obv.  occurs  on  con- temporary  coins  of  Ialysos  and  Lindos  (Gabrielsen  ( 2000b) 182).

The  fact that  it  paid  individually  may  suggest  that  it  was  a  dependent polis  inside  the  territory of  Ialysos  (cf.  Hansen  ( 1997)  31), or--considering the sporadic nature of  its  payments--may suggest  civic  disorder  at  Ialysos.  Alternatively,  the  appear- ance  of  the  Brikindarioi  may  indicate  an  arrangement imposed  by  the  Athenians  in  order  to  weaken  a  powerful ally,  as  all  three  major  poleis  must  have  been.

Tact. 18.13. According  to Diod. 13.75.1,the  inhabitants  of  the  three  old major  poleis  in 408/7  relocated  to  the  city  of  Rhodos ( \u00b5  \u00b5    \u00b5 `),  a  process  which  Strabo  14.2.10  describes  as  synoe- cism.  As  in  numerous  other  cases,  only  part  of  the  popula- tion  was  transferred  to  the  new  urban  centre,  and  it  is  clear that  the  synoecising  cities  continued  to  exist  (Gabrielsen ( 2000b)  188;  cf.  nos. 995\u00ad97).  It  is  as  yet  unresolved  to  what extent  the  building  of  the  town  of  Rhodos  was  \"immediate- ly  followed  by a  significant demographic e vent\"  (Gabrielsen ( 2000b)  189);  however,  three  things  are  worth  noting.  ( 1)  It  is apparent  from  Thuc. 8.44.2  that  in  411  no  city  of  Rhodos  was yet  in  existence.  ( 2)  The  democratic  revolution  in  395  took place  in  Rhodos  town  (Diod. 14.79.6: ),  which  by  the time  already  had  harbours  capable  of  sheltering  large  fleets (Hell.  Oxy. 18.2;Diod.14.79.6)  and  an  agora  (Hell.  Oxy.),  and was  the  place  where  officials r esided  (Hell.  Oxy.)  and  assem- blies  were  held  (Hell.  Oxy.).  ( 3)  At  the  time  of  the  floods in 316  the  city  had  a  whole  range  of  public  buildings  (Diod. 19.45.6\u00ad8),  and  during  the  siege  in  305  by  Demetrios Poliorketes,  Rhodos  was  a  populous  city  (Diod. 20.84.3). The  territory  of  Rhodos  corresponded  to  those  of  Ialysos, Kamiros  and  Lindos  (c. 1,400  km \u00b2),  and  included  a  peraia already  by  C 4  (Ps.-Skylax  99;  Gabrielsen  ( 2000a)  149).  The population  of  Rhodos  consisted  of  the  populations  of  the three  synoecising  poleis,  which  were  constituted  as  phylai (subdivided  into  demes:  Papachristodoulou  ( 1999b))  of  the new  polis  ( ':  BCH 99  ( 1975)  p. 97  col.  B. 26\u00ad27  (C 3); \u00b5:  Tit.  Cam. 21.6  (C 2); :  BCH 99  ( 1975)  p. 97 col.  A. 8\u00ad9  (C 3);  see  Jones,  POAG 243\u00ad44).  According  to Diod. 20.84.3,  during  the  siege  of 305  there  were  6,000 able-bodied  politai  in  the  city  of  Rhodos. At  its  foundation,  Rhodos  presumably  became  an  ally  of Sparta  (no. 345),  as  were  the  three  synoecising  cities  (Thuc. rhodos  1205 8.44.2;  Berthold  ( 1980)  35\u00ad36);  prior  to 395,however,the Rhodians  revolted  from  Sparta  (Diod. 14.79.6;Bruce ( 1961) 166\u00ad68).  Rhodos  was  a  member  of  a  symmachia  attested exclusively  by  the  so-called  coinage  (whose  legend abbreviates  synmachon,  synmachikon  or  synmachia,  vel  sim.) dating  to  C 5l\u00adC4e;  the  other  poleis  striking  coins  were Byzantion  (no. 674),  Ephesos  (no. 844),  Iasos  (no. 891), Knidos  (no. 903),  Kyzikos  (no. 747),  Lampsakos  (no. 748) and  Samos  (no. 864)  (Karwiese  ( 1980);  Debord  ( 1999) 273\u00ad77).  Rhodos  was  a  founding  member  of  the  Second Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.80  ( 378/7)),  and  was  prob- ably  allied  with  Athens  (no. 361)  prior  to its  entry  into  the League  (Berthold  ( 1984)  28).  However,  in  357/6,  Rhodos joined  Chios  (no. 840),  Kos  (no. 497)  and  Byzantion  (no. 674)  in  a  revolt  against  Athens  (the  \"Social  War\"  of 357\u00ad355, Diod. 16.7.3;  cf.  Dem. 15.3  and  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 305);  the  war ended  in  355  when  the  Athenians,  fearing  Persian  support for  the  rebels,  concluded  peace  with  them  (Diod. 16.22.2), and  recognised  the  independence  of  the  rebels  (Berthold ( 1980)  43;  Cargill  ( 1981)  182\u00ad83).  In  340,  Rhodos  sent  out forces,  presumably  naval,  to support  Byzantion  against Philip  II  of  Makedon,  a  support  described  as  \u00b5\u00b5  by Diod. 16.77.2  (Berthold  ( 1980)  45\u00ad46).  In  332,  Rhodos  sub- mitted  to  Alexander  the  Great  (Arr.  Anab. 2.20.2),  but  the Makedonian  garrison  installed  probably  on  this  occasion was  expelled  in  323  (Diod. 18.8.1). Oligarchic  exiles  are  attested  at  Hell.  Oxy. 18.3,  and  in 391/0,     `     \u00b5 arrived in  Sparta.  A  navy  is  attested  in  Xen.  Hell. 4.8.22  (at  least  six- teen  triremes)  and  Lycurg. 1.18  (cf.  Diod. 16.77.2  (r 340)); Arist.  Pol. 1304b29  attests  to  the  existence  of  trierarchoi  (cf. Diod. 20.88.6  (r 305)). Reception  of  an  Athenian  embassy  is  recorded  by  Plut. Mor. 850A  (rC 4s).  Sending  of  an  embassy  of  submission  to Alexander  is  recorded  in  Arr.  Anab. 2.20.2  (r 332).  Exchange of  embassies  with  Argos  (no. 347)--and presumably other poleis  of  mainland  Greece--at the time of  the  Lamian  War  is attested  by  an  Argive  decree  (SEG 19  317  ( 325\u00ad300)  with Stroud  ( 1984)  215\u00ad16).  During  the  grain  crisis  of 330\u00ad326, Rhodos  received  30,000  medimnoi  from  Kyrene  (no. 1028) (Tod 196.11). A  grant  of  proxeny  by Athens  to a  citizen  of  Rhodos  is attested  by  IG ii\u00b2  19a  ( 394/3),  and  one  to  three  men  by Arkesine  (no. 472)  by  IG xii.78  (C 4l\u00adC3e);  a  grant  of  proxe- ny  by  an  unknown  Ionian  polis  to  citizens  of  Rhodos  is found  in  Peek,  Inschriften  von  den  dorischen  Inseln  no. 1 (c. 300),  a  text  that  refers  also  to  an  earlier  grant.  A  grant  of citizenship  by  Athens  to  a  citizen  of  Rhodos  is  attested  by  IG ii\u00b2  19b  ( 394/3)  and  one  by  Chios  in  SEG 39  1151  ( 320s);  special honours,  including  the  right  to address  the  assembly,  were voted  by  Argos  to  citizens  of  Rhodos  c. 320  (Stroud  ( 1984) 215\u00ad16). Rhodos  must  initially  have  been  an  oligarchy  (Papa- christodoulou  ( 1999b)  29)  since  the  revolution  in  395 brought  a  democracy  to  power  (Hell.  Oxy. 18.3).However,in the  years  391/0\u00ad390/89  there  was  a  new  outbreak  of  stasis; oligarchs  and  democrats  had  the  opposing  faction  expelled, possibly  twice; the  oligarchs  were  supported  by Lakedaimonian  squadrons,  and  the  democrats  by  ships from  Athens  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.20\u00ad25,  30;Diod.  14.97.1\u00ad4, 99.4\u00ad5;  cf.  Westlake  ( 1983);  Gehrke,  Stasis 137\u00ad39,  pace Berthold  ( 1980)  39\u00ad40).  Aristotle's  mention  of  severe  civic disorder  arising  from  dikai  is  commonly  connected  with this  series  of  revolutions,  and  the  stasis  was  perhaps  trig- gered  by  the  democrats'  introduction  of  political  pay  (Pol. 1302b23\u00ad4,  32\u00ad33  and 1304b27\u00ad31).  In the  end  the  democrats must  have  expelled  the  oligarchs:  Rhodos  was  among  the founding  members  of  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League, and  shortly  after  the  Social  War  the  democracy  was  over- thrown  and  an  oligarchy  established  with  the  support  of  the Karian  satrap  Mausolos  (Dem. 15.3,  14\u00ad15,  19,  27\u00ad28; Theopomp.  fr. 121);  a  Karian  garrison  was  installed  (Dem. 15.14\u00ad15),  a  democratic  appeal  for  assistance  in  351  fell  on deaf  ears  in  Athens  (cf.  Dem. 15),  and  Rhodos  remained  oli- garchic  and  under  Karian  domination  until  the  time  of Alexander  the  Great  (Berthold  ( 1980)  43\u00ad44),  to  whom  the Rhodians  submitted  in  332  (Arr.  Anab. 2.20.2).  Alexander presumably  restored  democracy  (Berthold  ( 1980)  47; Bosworth  ( 1980)  243);  he  certainly  installed  a  garrison, whose  expulsion  is  attested  for  323  by Diod. 18.8.1.  For  the democratic  institutions,  see  Gabrielsen  ( 1997)  24\u00ad31. The  eponymous  official was the priest of  Helios  (SEG 12 360  (C 4)  with  Sherk  ( 1990)  283\u00ad85  and  Gabrielsen  ( 2000b) 202  n. 49); are  mentioned  in  Hell.  Oxy. 18.2,  and at  Diod. 20.88.3;  a  council  ( )  is  referred  to by SEG 19  317.31  ( 325\u00ad300)  (cf.  Diod. 20.93.5  (r 304): ).  Arist.  Pol. 1304b27\u00ad31  attests  to  the  existence  of  mis- thophora  during  a  democratic  period,  but  whether  for office-holding or assembly attendance vel sim.  is  left  unex- plained.A  meeting  of  the  ekklesia  is  attested  in  Hell.  Oxy. 18.2 (cf.  SEG 18  317.31  ( 325\u00ad300)).  The  earliest  preserved  public enactment  is  the  extremely  fragmentary  decree  SEG 15  496 (C 4).  Dem  56.47  refers  to a  dikasterion  at  Rhodos. Residence  of  free  foreigners  at  Rhodos  is  implied  by Lycurg. 1.55  ( \u00b5   `);  according  to Diod. 20.84.3,  1,000  able-bodied  foreigners  (  1206 nielsen  and  gabrielsen   )  participated  in  the  defence  of  the  city during  the  siege  of 305/4;  this  number,  however,  includes only  those  who  remained  behind  after  disabled  foreigners and  foreigners  unwilling  to serve  in  the  defensive forces  had left  the  city. The  acropolis  is  situated  on  the  terraced  hill  of  Ag. Stephanos  (Monte  Smith),  which  dominates  the  amphithe- atre-like  shape  of  the  city  (cf.  Diod. 19.45.3,  20.83.2).  The acropolis  was  included  within  the  circuit  of  the  city  wall  (cf. infra).  On  the  acropolis  are  remains  of  several  monumental structures,  but  in  their  present  form  these  are  all  Hellenistic or  later.  The  only  buildings  assumed  to  have  had  Classical predecessors  are  the  temple  of  Athena  Polias  and  Zeus Polieus  and  the  temple  of  Apollo  Pythios.  However,  very  lit- tle  is  known  about  the  acropolis,  since  no  systematic  excava- tions  have  been  conducted  there  so  far  (see  further Konstantinopoulos  ( 1973);  Livadiotti  and  Rocco  ( 1996) 12\u00ad26).  Also  of  Hellenistic  date  is  the  reconstructed  stadion east  of  the  temple  of  Apollo;  however,  it  has  now  been demonstrated  that  it  had  a  C 4  predecessor  with  opposite,  i.e. east\u00adwest,  orientation  (Valavanis  ( 1999)  esp. 99  with  fig. 4). Recent  archaeological  discoveries  prove  that  the  city  wall built  in  407  was  both  of  a  smaller  circumference  and  of  less- er  width  than  its  C 3e  successor.  To  date,  only  a  section  of some 20  m  of  the  early  wall  is  known;  it  is  constructed  of orthogonal  blocks  in  isodomic  technique,  and  its  width ( 0.60  m)  indicates  that  this  can  have  been  only  the  outer  face of  the  wall  of  whose  inner  face  and  central  and  inner  con- structions  (probably  in  wood)  nothing  remains  (Filimonos in  Hoepfner  and  Schwandner  ( 1994)  53).  This  type  of  con- struction  may  perhaps  explain  Diodorus'  description  of  a particular  stretch  of  this  wall  as     ( 20.86.2).  The  area  enclosed  by  the  early  wall  (c. 300  ha)  was much  smaller  than  the  area  enclosed  by  its  C 3e  successor (c. 430  ha;  see  Philimonos-Tsopotou  ( 1998)  fig. 10):  a  much stronger  and  enlarged  circuit  was  constructed  in  C 3e,  which at  certain  points  shows  a  width  of 3.50  m  and  even  4.10  m (see  further  Philimonos-Tsopotou  ( 1998),  ( 1999)). The  site  chosen  for  the  new  city  of  Rhodos  was  not  entire- ly  virgin  ground,  as  various  finds indicate (Dreliosi- Herakleidou  ( 1999)).  The  city  was  laid  out  on  an  orthogonal grid  plan  at  its  foundation,  but  the  direct  participation  of Hippodamos  himself  is  reported  only  by  Strabo  14.2.9  (see Wycherley  ( 1964);  Burns  ( 1976)).On  average,  each  street  was 5.50  m  wide,  with  the  exception  of  two  conspicuously  broad main  streets,  one  in  the  western,  the  other  in  the  eastern  part of  the  town,  which  were 16  m  and  16.5  m  wide  respectively (Kondis  ( 1958)  151;  ArchDelt 35  ( 1980)  Chron. 534).  In  general,  see  Konstantinopoulos  ( 1970),  ( 1988);  and Philimonos  ( 1996). Archaeologically,  the  Classical  city  is  poorly  known. However,  some  impression  of  the  C 4s  city  may  be  gained from  Diodorus'  description  of  the  great  flood of 316 ( 19.45.6\u00ad8).The  description  refers  to  ( 1)  private  houses  built in  stone:  such  houses  have  been  found  but  are  mostly  of  the Hellenistic  period  (Philimonos  ( 1996)  87);  ( 2)  drains ( ):  the  course  of  the  main  drain  is  known  for  a  stretch of 200  m  (Kondis  ( 1954)  11;  Philimonos  ( 1996)  85  fig. 12;see also  Owens  ( 1991)  59\u00ad60);  ( 3)  the  deigma,  which  may  or  may not  be  part  of  the  agora  mentioned  at  Hell.  Oxy. 18.2:  the agora  is  assumed  to  have  been  situated  in  the  centre  of  the town  near  the  great  harbour  and  within  the  mediaeval  town (Kondis  ( 1958)  152);  ( 4)  a  Dionysion:  this  sanctuary  is believed  to  have  been  situated  in  the  neighbourhood  of  the agora  (Philimonos  ( 1996)  82);  ( 5)  an  Asklepieion:  this  sanc- tuary  has  been  located  by  recent  finds in the south-western outskirts  of  the  mediaeval  town  (Papachristodoulou ( 1999a)  with  fig. 1);  ( 6)  a  theatre:  the  theatre  has  not  been located,  but  it  seems  a  reasonable  hypothesis  that  it  was  sit- uated  in  the  southernmost  section  of  the  acropolis (Philimonos  ( 1996)  76).  In  addition,  a  C 5l\u00adC4  sanctuary  of Demeter  Thesmophoros  has  been  identified in the northern part  of  the  city;  it  consists  of  eight  orthogonal  structures  and a  subterranean  room  (Zervoudaki  ( 1988);Yannikouri  ( 1999) with  fig. 2).  Finally,  for  what  it  is  worth,  it  may  be  noted  that Vitruv.  De  arch. 6  intr. 1  mentions  a  gymnasion  in  reference to  the  Classical  period  (cf.  Delorme  ( 1960)  82). As  early  as  the  390s,  the  city  was  equipped  with  several harbours  (Diod. 14.79.7  (r 396):   \u00b5;  cf. 20.82.3).  Archaeologically,  a  total  of  five harbours--all  out- side  the  circuit--are known,  one  of  which  is  described  as  \u00b5 \u00b5  by Diod. 20.85.4  and  is  commonly  identified with  the  modern  Mandraki  harbour.  Here,  remains  of neosoikoi  dating  from  before  and  after  227  have  been  found (Blackman  et al.( 1996)).  Immediately  south  of  Mandraki are  the  great  harbour,  the  Akantia  harbour  and,  further south,  the  southern  harbour.  The  fifth harbour was situated in  the  north-western  part  of  the  city;  this  harbour,  however, was  filled up when the city e xpanded  in  C 3.  Archaeological remains  associated  with  naval  facilities  have  been  discovered in  the  vicinity  of  these  harbours,  especially  by  the  western harbour  and  the  Mandraki  harbour  (Blackman  ( 1999); Philimonos-Tsopotou  ( 1998)  fig. 10). In  terms  of  architectural  splendour  and  topographical extent,  the  C 4  cemetery  complexes  stretching  out  south  of the  city  are  far  more  modest  in  scale  than  those  of  the rhodos  1207 Hellenistic  period,  the  early  graves  being  characterised  by simplicity.  The  C 4  graves  are  situated  not  only  by  the  city wall  but  also  at  a  considerable  distance  from  it,  perhaps  an indication  of  awareness  of  the  need  for  future  expansion  of the  urban  area.  On  the  cemetery  complexes,  see  Fraser ( 1977)  1\u00ad11;  Salta  ( 1999);  Patsiada  ( 2001)  esp. 34  and  fig. 1. The  patron  divinity  was  Helios,  depicted  on  the  obverse of  Rhodian  coins  (infra),  whose  priest  was  eponymous (supra)  and  in  whose  honour  pentaeteric  festivals  were  cele- brated  (Morelli  ( 1959)  94\u00ad99);  note,  however,  that  the  usual identification of  his  sanctuary  (Kontorini  ( 1989)  129\u00ad84)  is now  disputed  by  the  excavator  herself  (Michalaki-Kollia ( 1999)),  and  the  question  of  the  location  of  Helios'  sanctu- ary  must  be  considered  unresolved.  A  festival  of  Dionysos  is attested  by  SEG 19  317  ( 325\u00ad300);  cf.  Diod. 20.84.3.  See  fur- ther  Morelli  ( 1959). The  Rhodian  calendar  is  known  only  from  C 3m  onwards (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 167\u00ad85). C. 330\u00ad300,  the  Rhodians  dedicated  at  Delphi  a  sculptural group  depicting  the  chariot  of  Helios  (Jacquemin  and Laroche  ( 1986)). Mikinas  of  Rhodos  won  the  Olympic  stadion  in 324 (Diod. 17.113.1;  Olympionikai 469);  a  Rhodian  was  victorious in  the  Lykaian  Games  (Arkadia)  in  C 4l  (IG v.2550.vi.27). Beginning  shortly  after  the  synoecism,  Rhodos  struck coins  in  silver,  bronze  and  gold.  Silver:  Ashton  ( 2001)  divides the  Classical  period  silver  issues  of  Rhodos  (struck  initially on  the  Chian\u00adRhodian  standard,  later  on  a  reduced  stan- dard  termed  \"Rhodian\"  by  Ashton)  into  three  chronologi- cally  distinct  periods. ( 1)  408\u00adc.385:  the  issues  in  this  period  fall  into  two  groups: (a)  standard  Rhodian  issues,  and  (b)  a  special  series  of  the  so-called coins  with  which  is  associated  a  group  of conventional  Rhodian  coins  related  to  the  coins  by their  weight.  Re  (a),  this  group  includes  tetradrachms, hemidrachms  and  obols.  Types:  obv.  head  of  Helios  facing; rev.  rose  (on  tetradrachms  between  two  bunches  of  grapes)  in incuse  square,  with  or  without  symbols  below,  or  head  of nymph  Rhodos  to  r.  in  incuse  square;  legend: , ,  (Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 2  nos. 1693\u00ad94).  Re (b),  Rhodos  was  one  of  eight  poleis  producing  the  so-called coinage  in  C 5l\u00adC4e  (though  the  Rhodian  coins  in  fact do  not  use  the  legend  on  the  obverse;  cf.  Karwiese ( 1980)  20  n. 151);  just  over  twenty  silver  specimens  are  known (Aiginetan  didrachms,  or  Chian\u00adRhodian  tridrachms,  or double  sigloi).  Types:  obv.  infant  Herakles  strangling  ser- pents;  rev.  rose;  legend: (Karwiese  ( 1980);  Ashton  ( 1993) 13).  With  these  coins  are  associated  a  series  of  triple  sigloi  of conventional  Helios/rose  types  (Ashton  ( 2001)  nos. 7\u00ad10). ( 2)  C. 385\u00adlate  340s:  this  group  includes  tetradrachms, didrachms,  drachms,  hemidrachms  and  diobols.  The  types are  generally  similar  to  the  earlier  issues:  obv.  head  of  Helios facing;  rev.  rose  in  incuse  square,  beside  which  are  various symbols  and  letters;  legend: ,  ;  however,  the obv.  of  the  diobols  in  this  group  depict  for  the  first time the radiate  profile head of  Helios.  During  this  period tetradrachms  ceased  to  be  struck  (except  for  an  exceptional issue  struck  in  the  next  period)  and  were  replaced  by didrachms  as  the  main  denomination;  the  didrachms  were struck  to  a  reduced  weight  standard  (the  \"Rhodian\"  stan- dard  proper  of  Ashton  ( 2001))  which  became  established  as the  usual  standard  of  Rhodos. ( 3)  Late  340s\u00ad305/4:  this  group  includes  primarily didrachms,  but  also  an  exceptional  issue  of  tetradrachms  on the  Chian\u00adRhodian  standard.  Types  as  earlier;  legend: , . Bronze:  the  Rhodian  mint  struck  bronze  chalkoi  immedi- ately  after  it  began  to  function,  and  again  in  C 4s:  obv.  rose,  or head  of  nymph  Rhodos;  rev.  rose;  legend: ,  . Gold:  in  C 4s,  Rhodos  struck  gold  staters;  four  specimens  are known,  all  from  the  same  pair  of  dies:  obv.  head  of  Helios  fac- ing;  rev.  rose  with  bud  to  r.  and  grapes  to  l.,  all  in  incuse  square; legend: .Head,  HN \u00b2637\u00ad40;Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 2 1011\u00ad28;  SNG  Cop.

The  city-ethnic  is '  (ML 7c  and  g  ( 591);  C 5  coins  (infra))  or  ' (IG i\u00b3  71.i.128  ( 425/4))  or  (Anakreon  fr. 4.1,Page; SEG 28  48.6  (c. 394)). Ialysos  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Thuc. 8.44.2;  Ps.-Skylax 99;  IG xii.1677.15  (c. 300))  and  in  the  polit- ical  sense  (Hdt. 1.144.3). At IG xii.1677.18  and  Ergias  (FGrHist 513)  fr. 1,  polis  refers to  the  acropolis.  Patris  is  found  in  Timocreon  fr. 1.7. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  internally  on C 5  coins  (infra),  and  externally  in  Anakreon  fr. 4,  Page,  and IG i\u00b3  71.i.128  ( 425/4);  the  individual  and  external  use  is found  as  early  as  591  (ML 7  c  and  g). Ialysos  occupied  the  northernmost  part  of  the  island;  its territory  measured  c. 345  km \u00b2.  Several  second-order  settle- ments  within  the  territory  have  been  surmised  on  the  basis of  ceramic  surface  evidence  (Papachristodoulou  ( 1989) 83\u00ad146).  Of  these,  the  most  significant is located at the foot of  the  Daphne  Hill,  a  little  to  the  north-west  of  the  acropolis (Inglieri  ( 1936)  foglio  nord  p. 27  no. 20):  here  rich finds of Classical  pottery  have  been  made  (ASAtene 6\u00ad7  ( 1923\u00ad24) 326);  it  is  not  impossible  that  this  site  was  in  fact  part  of Ialysos  proper.  Another  settlement  of  moderate  size  seems to  have  been  situated  within  that  part  of  Ialysian  territory  on which  later  the  city  of  Rhodos  (no. 1000)  was  built  (Dreliosi- 1198 nielsen  and  gabrielsen Herakleidou  ( 1999)).  At  modern  Theologos  (Tholos)  north of  the  city  are  remains  of  a  temple  dedicated  to  Apollo Erethimios:  it  was  a  Doric  temple  constructed  c. 400  and measuring  7.8  13.10  m;  a  well  in  the  temenos  contained  C 5 pottery  (ClRh 2  ( 1932)  77\u00ad116).  Near  the  temple  are  remains of  a  C 4  theatre  with  a  horseshoe-shaped  koilon  (ibid.;  TGR ii. 281). With  Halikarnassos  (no. 886),  Kos  (no. 499),  Knidos  (no. 903),  Kamiros  (no. 996)  and  Lindos  (no. 997),  Ialysos formed  the  so-called  Dorian  hexapolis,  later  pentapolis,a cultic  association  centred  on  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo  at Triopion  near  Knidos  (Hdt. 1.144). Anakreon  fr. 4,  Page,  has  been  interpreted  as  indicating that  Polykrates  of  Samos  incorporated  Ialysos  in  his  \"empire\" (Weiss  and  Hurter  ( 1998)  13).  Ialysos  was  a  member  of  the Delian  League,  and  was  probably  among  the  original  mem- bers  (ATL  iii. 213).  Ialysos  belonged  to  the  Karian  district  (IG i\u00b3  271.ii.66),and  is  registered  in  the  tribute  lists  from  452/1  (IG i\u00b3  261.iv.13)  to  415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.i.11)  a  total  of  sixteen  times, four  times  completely  restored.  Ialysos  initially  paid  a  phoros of 10  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  263.i.11,  265.ii.27;  cf. 261.iv.13,  262.v.2,  264.ii.37 where  this  amount  is  completely  restored);  in  443/2,  the phoros  had  dropped  to  6  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  269.iv.10,  partly  restored) and  remained  so  until  432/1  (IG i\u00b3  270.iv.11,  271.ii.66, 272.ii.89,279.i.45,280.i.49);  in  428/7,10  tal.  was  again  paid  (IG i\u00b3  283.iii.19;  cf. 284.10),  but  in  421/20  only 5  tal.  was  paid  (IG i\u00b3 285.i.100).  Ialysos  was  assessed  for  tribute  in  424/3  (IG i\u00b3 71.i.128).  In  addition,  the  tribute  lists  thrice  register  the Brikindarioi  (no. 993),  the  inhabitants  of  Brikindera,  a  place in  the  territory  of  Ialysos  (Papachristodoulou  ( 1989)  124\u00ad31). In 412/11  a  Peloponnesian  squadron  arrived  at  Rhodos invited  by  some  wealthy  Rhodians  (Thuc. 8.44.1);  as  a  result, Ialysos  (with  Kamiros  and  Lindos)  defected  from  the Athenians  and  joined  the  Peloponnesians  in  the  war  against Athens  (Thuc. 8.44.2).Thuc.8.44.4  records  a  payment  by  the Rhodians  to  the  Peloponnesians  of 32  tal.,  but  the  share  con- tributed  by  Ialysos  to  this  amount  is  unknown.  An  attempt to  undo  the  new  alliance  with  the  Lakedaimonians  shortly after  was  quelled  by  a  squadron  commanded  by  the  Ialysian exile  Dorieus  (Diod. 13.38.5,  45.1;Gehrke,  Stasis 133\u00ad34).  The presumption  is  that  in  411  a  democratic  constitution  was replaced  by  an  oligarchy  and  that  the  following  neoterismos (Diod.)  was  an  attempt  to  bring  the  democrats  back  into power. According  to Diod. 13.75.1,in  408  the  inhabitants  of Ialysos  (and  Kamiros  and  Lindos)  \u00b5  \u00b5    \u00b5 `,aprocess which Strabo 14.2.10  refers  to by the  verb .  As  in  numerous other  cases,  only  part  of  the  population  was  transferred  to the  new  urban  centre,  and  it  is  clear  that  a  wholesale  reloca- tion  of  the  Ialysian  population  was  not  carried  out (Gabrielsen  ( 2000b)  188\u00ad89).  Furthermore,  there  appears  to be  no  good  reason  for  the  idea  that  the  foundation  of Rhodos  town  was  accompanied  by  a  fundamental  restruc- turing  of  the  political  organisation  of  the  island  (ibid. 189\u00ad90):  the  move  towards  pan-Rhodian  unity  had  begun long  before 408  (ibid. 180\u00ad87),  and  the  three  old  poleis  con- tinued  to  exist  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.25;  Ps.-Skylax 99)  and  function as  poleis  after 408  (Gabrielsen  ( 2000b)  192\u00ad95):  c. 394,  cit- izens  of  Ialysos  were appointed  proxenoi  by  Athens  as  their father  had  been  (Walbank  ( 1978)  no. 72;  SEG 28  48;  cf. Gabrielsen  ( 2000b)  192  with  n. 91),  and  Hellenistic  and  later inscriptions  describe  Ialysos  as  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  (IG xii.1677.16  (c. 300))  and  the  political  (IG xii.158.21 (Roman))  senses,  and  the  former  inscription  attests  to  the existence  of  a  council  (  \u00b5  )  and  an  assembly  (  ... ').  However,  Ialysos  was  now  a  subordinate polis  inside  the  polis  of  Rhodos,  and  constituted  a  phyle ( ';  Maiuri,  Nuova  silloge 19.i.6  (c. 200);  cf.  BCH 99 ( 1975)  p. 97  col.  B. 26\u00ad27  (C 3))  of  the  Rhodian  polis;  see  Jones, POAG 243\u00ad44.  In  the  Hellenistic  period,  a  system  of  Ialysian demes  is  attested,  as  is  the  employment  of  demotics  as  the third  part  of  personal  names  (IG xii.1  166).  By  analogy  with Kamiros  and  Lindos,  where  such  systems  are  known  to  have existed  in  C 4l,  it  may  be  assumed  that  it  existed  in  Ialysos  by that  time  as  well. The  existence  of  a  Ialysian  navy  may  be  inferred  from Diod. 13.70.2  (r 408)  (Gabrielsen  ( 2000b)  182). The  acropolis,  presumably  located  outside  the  city  prop- er,  was  called  Acha\u00efa  polis  (IG xii.1677.14  (c. 300);  Ergias (FGrHist 513)  fr. 1;Diod.  5.57.6).  It  was  situated  on  the  sum- mit  of  Mt.  Phileremos.  The  main  architectural  structure  was the  temple  of  Athena  Polias  and  Zeus  Polieus  (Suppl.  Epigr. Rh. i  no. 54  (no  date)).  In their  present  form  the  remains  of the  Doric  temple  are  C 4l,  but  a  limited  number  of  architec- tural  members  and  roof-tiles  attest  to  the  existence  of  a  C 6 predecessor  (Livadiotti  and  Rocco  ( 1999));  a  rich  deposit  to the  south  of  the  temple  contained  votive  offerings  dating from  C 9  to C 5  (Maiuri  ( 1928)). The  location  of  the  urban  centre  of  Ialysos  can  be  inferred from  IG xii.1677.15  (c. 300),from  which  it  appears  that  it  was situated  near  the  acropolis  (Gabrielsen  ( 2000b)  204  n. 87). However,  the  archaeological  evidence  for  the  city  is  scarce, and  the  urban  history  of  the  polis  thus  poorly  known. In C 5f  the  Diagorids  of  Ialysos  (cf.  Paus. 4.24.2)  and Diagoras  himself  won  several  Olympic  victories  (e.g. rhodos  1199 Olympionikai 252,  287,  299,  300);  Diagoras  himself  was  peri- odonikes  (Knab  ( 1934)  no. 9);  the  victors  are  described,  how- ever,  not  as  Ialysians  but  as  Rhodians  (IvO 151\u00ad52;Gabrielsen ( 2000b)  184);  but  some  Diagorids  participated  as  citizens  of their  new  polis,  Thourioi  (Olympionikai 322,  356),  where Dorieus  settled  after  his  exile  (Xen.  Hell. 1.5.19). Attested  cults  include  those  of  Athena  Polias  and  Zeus Polieus  (Suppl.  Epigr.  Rh. 54.5i  (undated))  and  Alektrona (Michel  434  (C 4\u00adC3)). Ialysos  began  issuing  coins  in  C 6s  and  struck  in  both  electrum  and  silver.  The  earliest  silver  coins  are  possibly  the so-called  palmette  staters  (anepigraphic)  on  the  \"Ialysian standard\"  and  their  fractions  (on  the  Aiginetan  standard: Bresson  ( 1981)  221),  which  have  been  attributed  to  Ialysos and  dated  c. 540\u00ad530:  obv.  palmette;  rev.  two  incuse  rectan- gles  separated  by  a  broad  band,  a  type  used  also  at  Kamiros (no. 996)  and  Lindos  (no. 997)  (Bresson  ( 1981);  Weiss  and Hurter ( 1998)  13\u00ad14).  The  main  issue  is  a  series  of  electrum fractions  and  silver  staters  with  thirds  and  minor  fractions, beginning  c. 520  and  continuing  into  C 5,  and  apparently struck  to  the  same  individual,  Ialysian,  standard  as  the  palmette  coins:  obv.  forepart  of  winged  boar  sometimes with  symbol  beneath;  rev.  eagle's  head  in  dotted  and  incuse square  with  floral ornament in c orner; legend: or (sometimes  on  both  obv. and  rev.;  sometimes  retrograde),  sometimes  no  legend. Minor  silver  fractions  struck  after  479  depict  ( 1)  obv. forepart  of  winged  boar  to  r.;  rev.  helmeted  head  of  goddess (Athena?);  anepigraphic  but  \"Gef.  in  Rhodos\"  (SNG  von Aulock 2777\u00ad78);  weight  1.37  g, 1.40  g diobol?;  ( 2)  obv. forepart  of  winged  horse;  rev.  rose  in  dotted  and  incuse square;  legend: (retrograde);  a  similar  obv.  occurs  on contemporary  coins  of  Kamiros  and  Lindos  (Gabrielsen ( 2000b)  182).

Il. 2.656;  IG i\u00b3  269.iv.18  ( 443/2);  I.Lindos 13  (before  411 or  later)),  (Callim.  Aet.fr. 7.20).  The  city-ethnic  is   (C 6\u00adC5  coins  (infra);  IG i\u00b3  71.i.120  ( 425/4);  I.Lindos 13). Lindos  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Thuc. 8.44.2;  Ps.-Skylax 99)  and  in  the  political  sense  (Hdt. 1.144.3);  akropolis  is  found  in  FGrHist 532  D. 1  (r 490). Damosios  is  found  in  I.Rhod.Per. 251.6\u00ad7  ( 440\u00ad420).Politai  is found  in  FGrHist 532  D. 1  (r 490). The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on C 6\u00adC5  coins  (infra)  and  in  I.Lindos 13  and 15\u00ad16  App.  (all before  411?).  The  external  collective  use  of  the  ethnic  is found  in  IG i\u00b3  71.i.120  ( 425/4),  269.iv.12  ( 443/2)  and  Hdt. 7.153.1  (r 689/8);  the  external  individual  use  is  found  in  Pl. Prt. 343A;  IG i\u00b3  1454A.38  ( 445\u00ad430);  and  possibly  I.Knidos 623 (C 4f). The  territory  of  Lindos  on  Rhodos  itself  measured c. 790  km \u00b2.  In  it  were  situated  several  second-order  settle- ments,  among  which  the  following  are  worth  noting.  At Kattabia,  in  the  south-western  part  of  the  territory,  an inland  settlement  is  indicated  by  an  Archaic  (and  later)  bur- ial  ground  (Inglieri  ( 1936)  foglio  sud  p. 69  no. 87).  On  the coast  south  of  Lindos,  remains  of  two  Archaic  settlements have  been  located,  one  at  Kiotari  and  another,  at  Plimmiti further  south,  at  Germatas,  where  the  settlement  seems  to have  been  fortified;  neither  of  these  sites  has  been  excavated (Konstantinopoulos  ( 1972)  24\u00ad25).  Finally,  and  most  con- spicuously,  there  is  Vroulia,  at  the  southernmost  tip  of  the island.  The  settlement  there  was  founded  ab  novo  c. 700; parts  of  the  settlement  have  fallen  into  the  sea,  but  the  preserved  remains  consist  of  a  fortification wall separating the  settlement  from  a  cemetery  to  the  north-east;  inside  the settlement  are  remains  of  two  rows  of  houses  and  a  small sanctuary  with  a  naiskos;  to  the  west  is  an  unbuilt  area.  The settlement  was  abandoned  in  C 6e.  See  further  Kinch  ( 1914); Drerup  ( 1969);  and  Melander  ( 1988).  Furthermore,  Lindian territory  extended  to parts  of  the  peraia  already  in  C 4:  this  is shown  by  I.Lindos 51.cii.17  (c. 325),  a  catalogue  of  donors arranged  by demes  and  including  the  deme  of  the   known  to  have  been  located  at  Physkos  in  the  peraia  (Fraser and  Bean  ( 1954)  57,  66\u00ad67). With  Halikarnassos  (no. 886),  Kos  (no. 499),  Knidos  (no. 903),  Ialysos  (no. 995)  and  Kamiros  (no. 996),  Lindos formed  the  so-called  Dorian  hexapolis,  later  pentapolis,a cultic  association  centred  on  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo  at Triopion  near  Knidos  (Hdt. 1.144). According  to  the  Lindian  Temple  Chronicle  (FGrHist 532 D. 1),  Lindos  was  besieged  in  490  by  a  Persian  force  under Datis;  the  siege  was  unsuccessful  and  ended  in  the  conclusion of  a  treaty  of  philia.  Lindos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian League,  and  was  probably  among  the  original  members  (ATL iii. 213).Lindos  belonged  to  the  Karian  district  (IG i\u00b3  271.ii.74), and  is  registered  in  the  tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.6) to 415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.i.8)  a  total  of  fifteen times,  once  complete- ly  restored.  Lindos  initially  paid  a  phoros  of 8  tal., 2,700  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.6;  cf. 261.iv.14  where  this  amount  is  completely restored);  in  448/7  it  paid  10  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  264.ii.11;  cf. 265.i.53, where  this  amount  is  restored);  in  445/4\u00ad440/39  it  paid  6  tal. (IG i\u00b3  267.iii.21,  269.iv.12,  270.iv.25,  271.ii.74,  272.ii.68);  in 433/2  and 432/1  it  paid  10  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  279.i.19,  280.i.51),  but  in 421/0  and  again  in  415/14  15  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  285.i.97,  290.i.8).  Lindos was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.120),  and  there  was a  speech  by Antiphon       (frr. 25\u00ad33, Thalheim).  In  addition,  the  tribute  lists  registered  two  other groups  connected  with  Lindos:  (i)  the     (no. 998)  and  (ii)  the  ~  (no. 999). In 412/11  a  Peloponnesian  squadron  arrived  at  Rhodos invited  by  some  wealthy  Rhodians  (Thuc. 8.44.1);  as  a  result, 1202 nielsen  and  gabrielsen Lindos  (with  Ialysos  (no. 995)  and  Kamiros  (no. 996)) defected  from  the  Athenians  and  joined  the  Peloponnesians in  the  war  against  Athens  (Thuc. 8.44.2).  Thuc. 8.44.4 records  a  payment  by  the  Rhodians  to  the  Peloponnesians  of 32  tal.,  but  the  share  contributed  by  Lindos  to  this  amount  is unknown.  An  attempt  to  undo  the  new  alliance  with  the Lakedaimonians  shortly  after  was  quelled  by  a  squadron commanded  by  the  Ialysian  exile  Dorieus  (Diod. 13.38.5, 45.1;Gehrke,  Stasis 133\u00ad34).  The  presumption  is  that  in  411  a democratic  constitution  was  replaced  by  an  oligarchy  and that  the  following  neoterismos  (Diod.)  was  an  attempt  to bring  the  democrats  back  into  power.  I.Lindos 13  is  a  treaty  of unknown  nature  between  Lindos  and  Cretan  Lyktos  (no. 974),  traditionally  dated  prior  to  411,  though  it  could  well  be later. According  to Diod. 13.75.1,in  408  the  inhabitants  of Lindos  (and  Ialysos  and  Kamiros)  \u00b5  \u00b5    \u00b5 `,aprocess which Strabo 14.2.10  refers  to by the  verb .  As  in  numerous other  cases,  only  part  of  the  population  was  transferred  to the  new  urban  centre,  and  it  is  clear  that  a  wholesale  reloca- tion  of  the  Lindian  population  was  not  carried  out (Gabrielsen  ( 2000b)  188\u00ad89).  Furthermore,  there  appears  to be  no  good  reason  for  the  idea  that  the  foundation  of Rhodos  town  was  accompanied  by  a  fundamental  restruc- turing  of  the  political  organisation  of  the  island  (ibid. 189\u00ad90):  the  move  towards  pan-Rhodian  unity  had  begun long  before 408  (ibid. 180\u00ad87),  and  the  three  old  poleis  con- tinued  to  exist  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.25;  Ps.-Skylax 99)  and  function as  poleis  after 408  (for  Lindos,  see  Gabrielsen  ( 2000b)  192 with  n. 87),  although  Lindos  was  now  a  dependent  polis inside  the  polis  of  Rhodos  (no. 1000)  and  constituted  a  phyle, (BCH 99  ( 1975)  p. 97  col.  A. 8\u00ad9  (C 3);  Suppl.  Epigr. Rh. i18.8  (C 2f))  of  the  Rhodian  polis;  see  Jones,  POAG 243\u00ad44. The  existence  of  a  Lindian  navy  may  be  inferred  from Diod. 13.70.2  (r 408)  (Gabrielsen  ( 2000b)  182).  Hoplites  are attested  by  I.Rhod.Per. 251.33  ( 440\u00ad420);  they  seem  to  have received misthos  for  service  (ll. 4\u00ad9).  Stratagoi  are  attested  in I.Rhod.Per. 251.40  ( 440\u00ad420). I.Lindos 15  (before  411)  is  a  grant  of  proxeny  (with  ateleia, etc.)  by  Lindos  to  a  man  of  unknown  origin;  I.Lindos 16  App. is  a  similar  grant  of  similar  date  to  a  man  described  as  \"living in  Aigyptos\",  presumably  in  Naukratis  (no. 1023)  (cf.  [ ]  `,ll.  17\u00ad18). A  C 6  tyranny  by  Kleoboulos  is  reported  in  later  sources; he  is  known  to  have  waged  war  in  Lykia  (FGrHist 532.23),but apart  from  that  nothing  substantial  is  known  of  his  rule (Berve ( 1967)  119\u00ad20,  588\u00ad89).  Democracy  seems  implied  by C 5s  enactment  formulas  (infra). The  existence  of  a  system  of  demes  and  the  practice  of using  demotics  as  the  third  part  of  personal  names  is  attest- ed  by  two  inscriptions  dating  from  c. 325  (I.Lindos 51;  IG xii.1 761).The  demes  were territorial  divisions  and  probably  sub- divided  into  ktoinai  (Gabrielsen  ( 1997)  29\u00ad31,151\u00ad54).About the  functions  of  these  units  nothing  is  known. The  eponymous  official was the priest of  Athena  Lindia (Sherk  ( 1990)  281\u00ad83).  The  assembly  (damos)  is  attested  by I.Lindos 16  App. 2  (before  411;  cf.  I.Lindos 23.3: [  ]  (c. 400)).  The  council, ,  is  securely  attested  by I.Rhod.  Per. 251.16\u00ad17,  35  ( 440\u00ad420)  and  I.Lindos 16  App. 1 (before  411);  it  was  probouleutic  (      \u00b5:  I.Lindos 16  App. 1\u00ad2;  cf.  I.Rhod.Per. 251  of 440\u00ad420, where  the  same  enactment  formula  has  been  restored). I.Rhod.Per. 251.26\u00ad27  ( 440\u00ad420)  attests  to  the  existence  of prytaneis  holding  office for a month,  and  so  presumably  a committee  of  the  council.  A  grammateus  (I.Lindos 16  App. 3, before  411)  and  a  board  of  epistatai  (I.Rhod.Per. 251.2  and 20 ( 440\u00ad420)),  of  the  council  or  of  the  assembly,  are also  attest- ed.  The  earliest  surviving  public  enactment  is  I.Rhod.Per. 251 ( 440\u00ad420),  an  enactment  by  the  council  and  assembly  con- cerning  the  cult  of  Enyalios. The  city  of  Lindos  was  situated  by  the  southern  peninsu- la  delineating  the  bay  of  Megalos  Gialos  on  the  western  coast of  the  island.  The  ancient  town  lies  beneath  its  modern  suc- cessor  and  is  thus  virtually  unknown,  with  the  exception  of a  small  rock-cut  theatre,  possibly  of  C 4  date,  which  occupies part  of  the  south-eastern  slope  of  the  acropolis  and  has  an estimated  capacity  of  c. 1,800\u00ad2,000  (Dyggve  ( 1960)  406\u00ad7; see  also  TGR  ii. 279).On  the  plateau  of  the  steep  rock  forma- tion  rising  above  the  city  was  the  Lindian  acropolis  (called in  (FGrHist 532)  D. 1  (r 490)).  It  served  as  a  place of  refuge  in  490  and  was  besieged  by  the  Persians  under Datis  ((FGrhist 532)  D. 1:  cf.  Dyggve  ( 1960)  51\u00ad52).  The  most important  feature  of  the  acropolis  was  the  temple  of  Athena Lindia,  whose  cult  is  assumed  to  have  been  instituted  by  C 8 (Konstantinopoulos  ( 1972)  32).The  earliest  known  temple  is C 6,  but  in  its  present  form  the  structure  is  Hellenistic (Dyggve  ( 1960)).  The  Archaic  temple  was  a  Doric amphiprostyle  (or  prostyle:  Gruben  ( 1986)  414)  with  four columns  at  each  end  and  situated  within  a  walled  temenos approached  by  a  long  staircase  (Dyggve  ( 1960)  112\u00ad26,  365, 463  with  fig.  II. 1  at 44;  Konstantinopoulos  ( 1986)  180  fig. 203).  Having  been  destroyed  by  fire (cf.  Blinkenberg, I.Lindos  cols. 198\u00ad200),  the  temple  was  rebuilt  in  C 4  on  a similar  plan  but  with  the  addition  of  monumental  propylaia rhodos  1203 entered  by a  21  m-wide  staircase  (Dyggve  ( 1960)  126\u00ad30; Konstantinopoulos  ( 1986)  fig. 205).North-east  of  the  acrop- olis,  on  the  rocky  plateau  of  Vigli,  clearly  visible  from  the acropolis,  was  the  Boukopion,  an  Archaic  sanctuary  consist- ing  of  a  grotto  on  top  of  which  was  a  small  temple  whose dedicatee  divinity  is  unknown;  the  temple  is  Archaic,  but  its precise  date  is  disputed  (Dyggve  ( 1960)  459\u00ad63);  rock-cut inscriptions  at  the  sanctuary  date  from  C 6  onwards (I.Lindos 580\u00ad612). In  the  Hellenistic  period,  a  group  of  citizens  described  as \u00b5  (or  as  being  \u00b5 ) is commonly encountered  in  inscriptions;  matroxenoi  were  full  citizens though  their  mothers  were  of  foreign  extraction  (Morelli ( 1955);  Hannick  ( 1976);  Gabrielsen  ( 1992)  48  n. 7).  An inscription  of  c. 325  shows  that  the  group  of  matroxenoi existed  already  in  C 4  (I.Lindos 51.ci.26\u00ad27:[ ][]   \u00b5  [ \u00b5 ] ,  in  a  list  of  donors arranged  by  demes);  the  implication  is  that  a  group  of  free foreign  women  married  to  Lindian  citizens  resided  in  the community. I.Rhod.Per. 251.26  ( 440\u00ad420),  refers  to the  month Artamitios,  and,  prior  to  the  synoecism  of  Rhodos  city, Lindos--as w ell  as  Ialysos  and  Kamiros--may have had its own  individual  calendar  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 168). An  undated  communal  dedication  by  Lindos  in  Delphi  is mentioned  in  Paus. 10.18.4  (Jacquemin  ( 1999)  no. 336). The  chief  divinity  of  Lindos  was  Athena  Lindia,  in  whose sanctuary  state  documents  were  published  (I.Lindos 16  App. 9\u00ad10  (before  411));  the  sanctuary  was  also  of  wider,  pan- Rhodian  importance:  documents  of  Kamiros  were  deposit- ed  there  (Tit.  Cam. 105.16  (C 4e))  and  a  copy--inscribed in golden  letters--of  Pind.  Ol. 7,celebrating  an  Olympic  victo- ry  by  Diagoras  of  Ialysos,  was  deposited  there  as  well (Gorgon  of  Rhodos  (FGrHist 515)  fr. 18;  on  Athena  Lindia, see  Morelli  ( 1959)  80\u00ad86).Zeus  Polieus  is  attested  by  I.Lindos 56.B  ( 313\u00ad275);Apollo  Pythios  by  I.Lindos 61a.3  (c. 308);a  cult of  Enyalios  is  attested  by  I.Rhod.Per. 251  ( 440\u00ad420).  Other attested  cults  include  those  of  Athena  Apotropaia  (Nuovo Supplemento  Epigr.  Rh. 20  (C 4)),  Zeus  (I.Lindos 26.2 (c. 400)),  Zeus  Polieus  (I.Lindos 56  (c. 313)),  Apollo  (I.Lindos 57C  (c. 313)),  Enyalios  (I.Rhod.Per. 251  ( 440\u00ad420)),  and Hermes  (I.Lindos 20  (c. 400)). Lindos  began  issuing  coins  in  C 6  and  continued  minting down to at  least  408;  the  earliest  issues  included  small  elec- trum  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2637;  cf.  J.  Hirsch  Auct.  xiii  4002\u00ad3) and  silver  already  in  C 6.  The  types  are  obv.  lion's  head  with open  jaws  and  tuft  of  hair  on  forehead;  rev.  incuse  square divided  into  two  oblong  halves  by  broad  band  (a  type  used also  at  Kamiros  (no. 996)  and  Ialysos  (no. 995);  if  the  attri- bution  of  the  palmette  coins  to  Ialysos  is  accepted;  cf.  supra 1200);  some  coins  are  anepigraphic,  but  when  present  the legend  is  ,  (sometimes  retrograde:  Babelon,  Trait\u00e9 ii. 1  no. 779;Fried ( 1987)  no. 46)  or   (Babelon,Trait\u00e9  ii. 1  no. 781;  Cahn  ( 1957)  22).  The  silver  coins were  struck,  according  to  Babelon,  first on the M ilesian standard  (Trait\u00e9  ii. 1.  475\u00ad78:  staters  and  diobols;  cf.  Cahn ( 1957)  25),  later  on  the  Aiginetan  (Trait\u00e9  ii. 2.  1011\u00ad12:  diobols and  hemiobols).  After  479,  Lindos  struck  minor  silver  frac- tions  with  types:  obv.  forepart  of  a  horse;  rev.  lion's  head within  incuse  square;  legend: ;  similar  obverse  types were  employed  by  Ialysos  and  Kamiros  (Gabrielsen  ( 2000b) 182).

According  to  Hdt. 7.153.1,Lindos  founded  the  colony  Gela (no. 17)  in  Sicily  (see  also  Thuc. 6.4.3,reporting  that  the  orig- inal  site  of  Gela  town  was  called  ;  cf.  Fischer- Hansen  ( 1996)  321\u00ad22);  Thuc. 6.4.3  reports  that  Cretans  also participated  in  the  foundation  of  Gela  in  689/8  (see  further Gela  (no. 17)).In addition,  Lindos  is  claimed  by later  authors to  have  been  the  founder  of  Phaselis  (no. 942)  in  Lykia  in 691/0  (Philostephanos,  FHG iii  29;  Aristainetos  (FGrHist 771)  fr. 1);  but  this  tradition  is  not  beyond  suspicion.  The oecist  was  supposedly  Lakios  (Aristainetos  (FGrHist 771)  fr. 1;  Ath. 297E\u00ad298A),  a  native  of  either  Lindos  or  Argos (Philostephanos,  FHG iii  29),  but  he  is  possibly  mythical; Phaselis  is  described  as  Dorian  by  Hdt. 2.178.2,  but  is  not called  a   `  by  Ps.-Skylax.  According  to Strabo 14.5.8,  Lindians  and  Achaians  founded  Kilikian  Soloi  (no. 1021). Pind.  Ol. 7.73ff  relates  the  foundation  myth  of  the  three Rhodian  poleis  (they  were founded  by descendants  of Helios)  and  names  the  eponymous  hero  of  Lindos  (a  votive to whom  survives  as  I.Lindos 56Ab (c. 313)). 998.

Pindos  is  implicitly  classified as a polis  by  the  term used  by  the  unnamed  historians  quoted  by Strabo  at  10.4.6.  Ps.-Skymnos  594  counts  Pindos  as  the fourth  Dorian  polis;  and  Strabo  9.4.10  lists  four  poleis: Erineos,  Boion,  Pindos  and  Kytinion. Quoting  Theopompos  ((FGrHist 115)  fr. 364)  Steph.  Byz. 66.3\u00ad4  classifies Akyphas as a Dorian polis;  we  cannot  be  sure, however,  that  the  site-classification polis  is  part  of  the  quote. At Strabo  9.5.10  Akyphas  is  placed  in  Oitaia.  The  individual and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  a Delphic  inscription  (Rousset  ( 2002)  252.12  ( 191/0)).

It  seems  that  the  city  called  sometimes  Pindos,  sometimes Akyphas,  changed  its  regional  affiliation a c ouple  of  times.  It was  probably  not  part  of  Doris  in  C 5s,  when  the  region  had only  three  cities  (Thuc. 1.107.2;Diod.11.79.4).It  became  part of  Doris  in  C 4  (Theopomp.  and  Ps.-Skymnos).  By  C 2s  it belonged  to  Oitaia  (IG ix  1  227),  but  may  have  become Dorian  once  again  at  the  end  of  the  Hellenistic  period (Strabo  9.4.10);  see  Rousset  ( 1989)  231\u00ad3,(1994)  367.The only  remains  of  the  urban  centre  are  a  section  of  an  undated defence  circuit  (Rousset  ( 1989)  217). 390.Boion  (Boiaios) Map  55.

Patra  (  patris)  is found  in  CEG ii  850  ( 345\u00ad335). The  ancient  city  is  located  at  Balkiz  (Turkish  name),  on the  isthmus  of  the  Kapu  Dagi peninsula (ancient Arktonnesos)  jutting  out  from  the  south-west  coast  of  the Sea  of  Marmara.  Ps.-Skylax  94  mentions  that  Kyzikos  was lying      \u00b5   \u00b5    \u00b5,  while Anaximenes  of  Lampsakos  ((FGrHist 72)  fr. 26)  writes  about a (cf.  Strabo  2.5.23).  The  confusion  persists  in  later writers:  Diod. 18.51.2  (r 319): (cf.  Steph.  Byz.  s.v. ),  Plin.  HN 5.142  (relating  that  Alexander  the  Great insulam  continenti  iunxit  in 334).  The  island  of  Arktonnesos became  a  peninsula  through  the  construction  of  two  paral- lel  dykes  and  accumulations  of  sand.  It  is  assumed  that  the isthmus  had  been  connected  with  the  mainland  shortly before  the  first t estimonies,  but  that  the  insular  tradition was  so  strong  that  some  writers  continued  to  describe Kyzikos  as  an  island  (cf.  Philippson  ( 1910)  50;  Ruge  ( 1924) 228;  Akurgal  ( 1976b)  473). The  main  contribution  to  the  topography  of  Kyzikos  has been  produced  by Hasluck  ( 1902)  and  ( 1910);  for  supple- ments  see  especially  L.  Robert  ( 1955)  124  n. 7;  Schwertheim ( 1978)  227\u00ad28;  Vian  ( 1978),  while  some  archaeological  exca- vations  (Akurgal  ( 1956)  15\u00ad20)  brought  to light  orientalising ceramics  from  C 7l/C6e.  Unfortunately,  Kyzikos  remains \"the  least  studied  of  the  great  cities  of  Asia\"  (Mitchell  ( 1999) 130)  and  \"its  history  is  only  illuminated  by  stray  finds\" (Mitchell  ( 1985)  74),  as,  for  example  Archaic  sculptural  and architectural  marbles  from  C 6s  (Akurgal  ( 1965);  Koenigs ( 1981)).  Moreover,  there  is  no  complete  corpus  of  the  huge number  of  inscriptions  (list  at  Hasluck  ( 1910)  263\u00ad95;  funer- ary  inscriptions  at  Schwertheim  ( 1980);  cf.  BE  ( 1980) 389\u00ad423),  and  only  the  Hellenistic  and  Roman  funerary  ste- lae  have  been  brought  together  (Cremer  ( 1991)). Kyzikos  controlled  a  large  territory  inhabited  by  the indigenous (Hecat.  fr. 219;Strabo 14.5.29,  quoting Alexandros  of  Aitolia  (C 4\u00adC3);  schol.  Ap.  Rhod. 1.943,  961, the  propontic  coast  of  asia  minor  983 1024,  1037).  Originally,  the  territory  did  not  comprise  the whole  island,  since  at  least  Artake  (no. 736)  was  a  polis  with its  own  territory;  but  Kyzikos  later  absorbed  many  other  set- tlements  which  are  known  to  have  been  poleis:  Prokonnesos (no. 759)  (shortly  after  362/1:Dem.50.5;  Paus. 8.46.4),Artake (no. 736)  (perhaps  about  the  same  time),  Plakia  (no. 757) (towards  the  end  of  C 4),  Skylake  (no. 761),  Tereia  (no. 763) and  the  island  of  Bysbikos  (no. 738)  (at  latest  in  C 4)  and  the satrap's  residence  of  Daskyleion  (at  latest  in  the  early Hellenistic  period:  Robert  and  Robert  ( 1976)  231  with  n. 321, 232\u00ad35).  At  an  unknown  date  the  western  limit  between  the  territories  of  Kyzikos  and  Priapos  (no. 758)  was  at  the unlocated        (Strabo  13.1.11;see Harpagion  (no. 742)).  More  toponyms  are  recorded  by Steph.  Byz.  s.v. ( 442.16\u00ad17), \u00b5 ( 530.9\u00ad10),  and  \u00b5  ( 579.14).  Poimanenon  is  surely late  (first mention c. 80:  Kaufmann  and  Stauber  ( 1992)  45) and  so  may  the  other  settlements  be.  For  later  extensions  of the  territory  of  Kyzikos,  see  Jones  ( 1971)  86\u00ad88,  94. Kyzikos  was  founded  by  Miletos  (no. 854)  (Anaximenes of  Lampsakos  (FGrHist 72)  fr. 26).  Two  dates  are  given  for the  foundation  year: 756  (Euseb.  Chron. 88b,  Helm)  and  679 (ibid. 93b).Assuming  a  \"double  colonisation\",  some  scholars have  accepted  the  earlier  date  (Graham  ( 1958)  32,(1971) 39\u00ad42,(1983)  107),  but  the  archaeological  record  supports only  the  second  (Akurgal  ( 1956)  15,  19,(1976b)  474; Laubscher  ( 1963\u00ad64)  74;  Kiechle  ( 1959\u00ad60)  96;  Ehrhardt ( 1988)  42,  49\u00ad50;  Cremer  ( 1991)  9).  Thus  Kyzikos--together with  Prokonnesos,  the  earliest  colony  in  the  Propontis-- must  have  been  founded  c. 680.Alf\u00f6ldi  ( 1991)  137  suggests  an overland  expedition  from  Miletos  to  Kyzikos. Kyzikos  came  under  Persian  domination  after  547  and was  included  in  the  third  satrapy  ruled  from  Daskyleion. A  failed  attempt  to  establish  a  tyranny  is  recorded  under Kyros  (Ath. 1.30A),while  about  514/13Aristagoras  of  Kyzikos is  mentioned  among  the  Hellespontine  tyrants  (Hdt. 4.138.1).  Kyzikos  took  part  in  the  Ionian  Revolt  but  was  sub- jected  by  Oinobares,  the  satrap  in  Daskyleion  (Hdt. 6.33.3). About 478  it  joined  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  from  452/1  (IG i\u00b3 261.v.30)  to  418/17  (IG i\u00b3  287.ii.10)  a  total  of  thirteen  times, once  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 4,320  dr.  in 447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.i.95),  but  9  tal.  from  443/2  on  (IG i\u00b3 269.ii.23). A  change  of  the  constitution  towards  democracy  is  to  be assumed  thanks  to  Athenian  influence (see the prytanies  of the  phylai).  The  change  may  perhaps  be  connected  with  the story  told  at  Arist.  Oec. 1347b30\u00ad34:  after  a  stasis  the  demo- cratic  faction  got  the  upper  hand  over  the  oligarchs;  but instead  of  killing  their  opponents,  they  exacted  a  ransom and  had  them  exiled.  In  411  Kyzikos  defected  from  Athens (Thuc. 8.107.1),but  was  soon  reconquered  (Xen.  Hell. 1.11,14, 16\u00ad18).After  the  Peloponnesian  War  Kyzikos  was  allied  with or  perhaps  even  controlled  by  Sparta  (no. 345)  (Xen.  Hell. 3.4.10,  An. 7.2.5)  and  took  part  in  the  symmachia  with Rhodes  (no. 1000),  Knidos  (no. 903),  Iasos  (no. 891), Ephesos  (no. 844),  Samos  (no. 864),  Byzantion  (no. 674)  and Lampsakos  (no. 748)  (Karwiese  ( 1980),  but  cf.  Debord ( 1999)  273\u00ad77  for  a  date  post- 394).  In consequence  of  the King's  Peace,  Kyzikos  may  have  been  subject  to  Persia  for  a short  time  after  387/6.If  we  can  trust  schol.  Dem. 21.173  ( 586, Dilts),  Kyzikos  seems  to  have  joined  the  Second  Athenian Naval  League,  and  in  364  Timotheos  assisted  Kyzikos  when besieged  by,  probably,  a  Persian  satrap  (Diod. 15.81.5;Nep. Timoth. 1.2).  Shortly  afterwards,  in  362,  Kyzikos,  like Kalchedon  (no. 743)  and  Byzantion  (no. 674),  captured Athenian  merchantmen  (Dem. 50.6).During  the  Social  War ( 357\u00ad355)  the  Athenians  captured  Kyzikos'  merchantmen (Dem. 21.173);  Kyzikos  then  broke  with  Athens  (schol.  Dem. 21.173). An  alliance  with  Kalchedon  at  an  unknown  date  in  C 4f, perhaps  in  the  360s,  is  attested  by  the  fact  that  Kyzikene  sol- diers  assisted  the  city  of  Kalchedon  during  a  siege  (Aen.  Tact. 12.3;  P  Oxy. 303,  perhaps  also  Arist.  Oec. 1347b20\u00ad30).  At  the beginning  of  Alexander's  campaign  Kyzikos  was  unsuccess- fully  besieged  by  the  satrap  Memnon  (Diod. 17.7.3;  Polyaen. 5.44.5). An  isopolity  treaty  with  Miletos  (no. 854)  (Milet. i.3 137  Gawantka  ( 1975)  no. 19)  is  attested  shortly  after  334 (Ehrhardt  ( 1987)  114\u00ad16)  but  may  go  back  to C 5  or  even  ear- lier  (Graham  ( 1983)  117,  cf. 107\u00ad8;  Ehrhardt  ( 1988)  235\u00ad38). Citizens  of  Kyzikos  were  awarded  proxenia  by  Karthaia  (no. 492)  (IG xii.5542.54\u00ad55  (C 4m))  and  Chios  (no. 840)  (PEP Chios 50.12  (C 4)). Local  inscriptions  (starting  with  Michel  533.1  (c. 390)) produce  evidence  for  all  the  six  Milesian  phylai:  Geleontes, Aigikoreis,  Argadeis,  Hopletes,  Boreis,  Oinopes  (Jones, POAG 287\u00ad90;  Ehrhardt  ( 1988)  384  n. 24)  and  for  the  six (Michel  596.3;  Hasluck  ( 1910)  250\u00ad51;  Bilabel ( 1920)  120\u00ad21;  Ehrhardt  ( 1988)  107\u00ad9). A  popular  assembly  ( \u00b5) and a council (  )  are attested  in  a  probouleutic  decree  of  C 4  (BCH 13  ( 1889) 514\u00ad18).  Assembly  and  council  were presided  over  by monthly  shifting  prytaneis  belonging  to  one  of  the  six  tribes, so  that  each  tribe  must  have  been  in  prytany  twice  during  a year  (Michel  533  (c. 390);  Hasluck  ( 1910)  251\u00ad52  and 266  with 984 avram the  list  of  inscriptions).  There  was  a  prytanarch.  Meetings  of the  demos  were  chaired  by  a  daily  epistates  assisted  by  a grammateus  (Michel  533;  cf.  Ehrhardt  ( 1988)  100;  Rhodes, DGS 415\u00ad17).  The  original  eponymous  magistrate  may  have been  a  (unattested,  but  highly  probable  by reason of  the  Milesian  model:  Ehrhardt  ( 1988)  194\u00ad95).  In  C 4f  the eponymous  magistrate  was  an  archon  (SGDI 5523,  perhaps attesting  some  passing  Athenian  influence;  see  Ehrhardt ( 1988)  195).  From  about  C 4m  he  was  replaced  by  a (Michel  596),  perhaps  in  connection  with  the conquest  of  neighbouring  communities  (Hasluck  ( 1910) 254\u00ad55,  cf. 304\u00ad5:  list  of  the  attested  eponyms).  Other  offi- cials  are  a  board  of  strategoi  (Michel  596.2  (C 4f))  and hieromnemones  (SGDI 5523.3  (C 4m)). Kyzikos  had  no  walls  in  410  when  the  city  was  attacked  by Athens  (Thuc. 8.107.1;Diod.  13.40),  but  the  Athenians  pre- sumably  fortified the city since it was taken b y  the  Spartans and  Persians  in  410  \"after  a  siege\"  ( ,Diod. 13.49.4).  Defensive  walls  are  attested  in  a  building  inscrip- tion  of  C 4f(Michel 596)  and  their  existence  can  be  inferred from  the  account  of  the  siege  of  Kyzikos  in  364  (Diod. 15.81.5; Nep.  Timoth. 1.2). The  evidence  of  public  architecture  is  remarkably  rich.  A prytaneion  is  mentioned  in  a  dedication  of  C 6l  (Syll. \u00b34.5\u00ad6). An honorific decree of  C 3e  (Michel  534)  refers  to a  theatre ( 12,  21;  TGR  iii. 390),  an  agora  ( 14),  and  a  Doric  stoa  ( 24:     ),which indicates that these mon- uments  existed  at  least  in  C 4l  if  not  earlier.  A  temple  ( ) is  attested  by  an  inscription  of  C 6  recording  the  building  of its  roof  by  means  of  the  income  produced  by  the  sacred lands  and  the  sale  of  the  skin  of  sacrificed animals (Robert and  Robert  ( 1950)  78\u00ad80).  At  Kyzikos  was  located  \"the  earli- est  sanctuary  in  Asia\"  for  Athena  (Anth.  Pal. 6.342.5\u00ad6), which  is  perhaps  to  be  identified w ith  the     (cf. Hasluck  ( 1910)  236)  and  with  the  \u00b5    [ ] (SEG  28  953.79;  for  the  restoration,  see  S\u00e8ve ( 1979)  359  n. 189). Strabo  12.8.11  records  two  harbours,  one  on  either  side  of the  two  bridges  that  connected  the  island  with  the  mainland (Lehmann-Hartleben  ( 1923)  63\u00ad64,  262\u00ad63;  L.  Robert  ( 1955) 122\u00ad25  with  pls.  XXI  no. 2,  XXII  nos. 1\u00ad2).  The  channels between  the  bridges  formed  a  kind  of  \"third\"  harbour (Philippson  ( 1910)  50),  presumably  identical  with  the  \u00b5 mentioned  at  schol.  Ap.  Rhod. 1.940  and  the  \u00b5  recorded by Syll. \u00b3799.ii.2  (S\u00e8ve  ( 1979)  349\u00ad51).  For  the  topography, see  Hasluck  ( 1902)  pl.  XI:  plan  by  R.  de  Rustafjaell;  cf. L.  Robert  ( 1955)  122\u00ad25.  The  western  harbour  has  been  identified (S\u00e8ve ( 1979)  351)  with  the   \u00b5  recorded at  schol.  Ap.  Rhod. 1.987a  (quoting  the  local  writer Deiochos).  Minor  harbours  belonging  to  the  Kyzikene territory  were  at  Panormos  (schol.  Ap.  Rhod. 1.954: \u00b5 \u00b5  ),  located  at  modern Bandirma  (Lehmann-Hartleben  ( 1923)  293  n. 4)  and  Bathys Limen,  which  could  be  sought  at  Artake  (no. 736)  or  on  the north  coast  of  the  island,  in  the  area  of  the  village  of  Kerek (Greek  Vathy):  cf.  L.  Robert  ( 1955)  128\u00ad31;  S\u00e8ve  ( 1979) 351  n. 132. Kyzikos'  patron  deity  was  Apollo  (Hecat.  fr. 217;  SNG  Cop. Mysia 43,  57;  cf.  Hasluck  ( 1910)  228\u00ad32;  Ehrhardt  ( 1988)  135). In  addition  to  Athena  Polias  (supra),  there  is  evidence  for  an Athena  called  on  a  coin  (Imhoof-Blumer ( 1890)  614  no. 168),  and  her  worship  is  also  attested  by  Ap. Rhod. 1.955.  A  very  popular  civic  cult,  at  least  from  C 4 onwards,  was  that  of  Kore  with  the  epithet  soteira  (App. Mithr. 75)  attested  on  C 4  coins  (SNG  Cop.  Mysia 53\u00ad56, 58\u00ad62,  infra).  Other  communal  cults  are  attested  by  various sources:  [] (Delphic oracle for Kyzikos: SGDI 2970;  Hasluck  ( 1910)  221  and 301.4\u00ad5;  perhaps  also  on coins  from  C 5:  SNG  Deutschland.  Nachtr\u00e4ge ii  7320); Poseidon  (with  various  epikleseis  in  Hellenistic  and  later inscriptions  summarised  by  Ehrhardt  ( 1988)  475  n. 886; depicted  on  coins  from  c. 450  to C 4,  e.g.  SNG  Deutschland. Nachtr\u00e4ge ii  no. 7310);  Kybele  (Hdt. 4.76.2\u00ad3);  Pan  (Michel 533  Hasluck  ( 1910)  264  no. 4  (c. 390);  on  coins  from  c. 450  to C 4  (SNG  Deutschland.  Nachtr\u00e4ge ii  7319));  the  hero Herakles  (Archaic  relief:  Akurgal  ( 1961)  239).  There  is  also evidence  for  some  civic  festivals:  a  festival  for  Kybele  (Hdt. 4.76.3)  and  the  Anthesteria  for  Dionysos  (Michel 534  Hasluck  ( 1910)  264  no. 5.20,  27;  SEG 28  953.52\u00ad53). Through  Ap.  Rhod. 1.936ff  a  foundation  myth  can  be traced  back  to  the  local  writer  Deiochos  (C 5l\u00adC4f).  He  tells the  story  of  Kyzikos,  the  young  king  of  the  Doliones  who  was killed  by  a  terrible  mistake  by  Jason.  The  hero  Kyzikos  can  be recognised  on  electrum  coins  of  C 5f(BMC  Mysia 21  no. 23). On  the  other  hand,  a  Milesian  origin  of  the  city  is  also  attest- ed  in  the  Classical  period  (Anaximenes  of  Lampsakos (FGrHist 72)  fr. 26  and  Kyzikos'  isopolity  treaty  with Miletos). The  Kyzikene  calendar  was  identical  with  the  Milesian (Samuel  ( 1972)  116;  cf.  Ehrhardt  ( 1988)  116)  apart  from  the month  Boudion Milesian  Boedromion  (Schwertheim ( 1986)  13\u00ad14  (C 4);  cf.  Knoepfler ( 1997)  359,  412  n. 56). Outside  Kyzikos  Boudion  is  attested  only  at  Apollonia  on the  Rhyndakos  (Abmeier  ( 1990)  5). Kyzikos  possessed  a  practical  monopoly  of  coining  the so-called  Kyzikenes.  From  C 6f  to  C 4,  they  were  the  most the  propontic  coast  of  asia  minor  985 important  currency  in  the  area  from  Troy  to  Ionia,  in  the Propontis,  in  Bithynia  and  in  the  Black  Sea  regions  (Alf\u00f6ldi ( 1991)  129\u00ad34).Kyzikos  struck  electrum  staters  weighing  c. 16 g  from  c. 550  (Mildenberg  ( 1993\u00ad94)  7)  until  after  322/1 (Touratsoglou  ( 1999)  353,  356\u00ad57).  Denominations:  elec- trum  staters,  one-sixth  staters  and  a  few  smaller  fractions (Head,  HN \u00b2522).  On  the  exchange  rate  of  the  Kyzikenes,  see Bogaert ( 1977).Types:  obv.  c. 240  different  types  (Jenkins  and Castro  Hipolit\u00f2  ( 1989)  61),  perhaps  changing  every  year (Mildenberg  ( 1993\u00ad94)  3,7),but  all  with  the  tunny  fish as the main  type  or  later  as  an  adjunct  type  (Head,  HN \u00b2523; Kiechle  ( 1959\u00ad60)  97);  rev.  quadripartite  incuse  square (SNG  Cop.  Mysia 35\u00ad44).  Kyzikos  also  struck  silver  coins from  c. 550\u00ad530  onwards  (Mannsperger  ( 1989)  nos. 2206\u00ad8, pl. 80)  and  bronze  coins  from  c. 400  (Fritze  ( 1917)). Denominations:  obols  and  their  divisions  in  C 6\u00adC5, tetradrachms  on  the  Rhodian  weight  standard  in  C 4,  small fractions  in  bronze.  C 5  types:  obv.  forepart  of  boar,  behind, tunny;  rev.  lion's  head  in  incuse  square;  legend:  on  some   reversed.  C 4:  obv.

Taking  a  strange  coincidence  revealed  by the  calendars  into  consideration  (supra),  another  Kyzikene foundation  might  have  been  Apollonia  on  the  Rhyndakos (supra 975).  In  both  cases  primary  Milesian  foundation  is  the alternative  (and  perhaps  more  likely)  explanation. 748. ", "Harpagion": "Identifier: 743. , (Harpagianos) Map  52.

According  to  Strabo  13.1.11,  Harpagion  (    ) was  situated  between  Kyzikos  (no. 747)  and  Priapos  (no. 758).  It  has  not  been  convincingly  located  (Olshausen  ( 1974) 483),but  a  position  near  the  mouth  of  the  river  Granikos  was suggested  in  ATL  i. 470. Harpagion  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  in  the tribute  lists  from  448/7  (IG i\u00b3  264.iii.37)  to  429/8  (IG i\u00b3 282.iii.36)  a  total  of  fourteen  times,  twice  completely restored,  paying  in  all  years  a  phoros  of 300  dr.  (IG i\u00b3 264.iii.37).  It  was  perhaps  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3 71.iii.68,  completely  restored).  Harpagion  is  not  mentioned in  later  historical  sources,  and  one  may  assume  that  it  was incorporated,  possibly  in  C 4l,  into  either  Priapos  (no. 758) or  Kyzikos  (no. 747).  In  C 4,  before  the  incorporation, Harpagion  struck  bronze  coins.  Types:  obv.nymph,head turreted;  rev.  fish,  below  corn-ear;  legend:  (Fritze  ( 1913)  14  no. 597). 743.

The  city-ethnic  is (I.Kios 2.5  (C 4m)  Tod 149).  Kios  is  called  a  polis both  in  the  political  sense  (I.Kios 1\u00ad2  (C 4);  tentatively restored  in  SEG 45  208.5  (C 4l))  and  in  the  urban  sense  (Ps.- Skylax 93,  where    is  listed  under  the  heading  ` ).The collective and internal use of the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  an  honorific decree of  C 4m (I.Kios 2.5)  and  on  C 4  coins  (infra).  The  external  use  is  found in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  259.vi.7).  For  the  individ- ual  and  external  use,  see  the  C 4  Athenian  tombstone  set  over two  men  and  four  women  from  Kios  (Agora xvii  519). Kios  is  located  at  modern  (Turkish)  Gemlik,  where,  in 1835,  Texier  could  see  remains  of  ancient  walls  and  scattered architectural  fragments  (Texier  ( 1862)  113).  Its  territory  was presumably  bordered  towards  the  north  by the  mountains Karli-Dagi,  towards  the  east  by  the  Askanian  lake  (I . znik G\u00f6l\u00fc),  towards  the  south-east  by  Mt.  Kurban-Dagi,  perhaps halfway  between  Kios  and  Prusa,  in  the  area  of  the  villages  of D\u00fcrdane,  Sel\u00e7ukgazi  and  Se\u00e7k\u00f6y,  and  towards  the  south  by the  territory  of  Myrleia  (no. 752)  (  the  later  Apameia),  in the  region  between  the  villages  Kur \u017esunlu  (belonging  to Apameia)  and  Tuzla\u00e7iftligi  (Corsten  ( 1985)  9\u00ad10). Pythopolis  (no. 760),  in  C 4  a  Kian  kome  near  the  Askanian lake  120  stades  from  Kios  (Arist.  Mir.  ausc. 834b34),  has  been identified w ith  modern  S\u00f6l\u00f6z,  on  the  south  shore  of  the I . znik  G\u00f6l\u00fc  (Corsten  ( 1987)  148\u00ad49)  and  thus  indicates  the limit  of  the  Kian  territory  in  this  direction. According  to  Euseb.  Chron. 97b,  Helm,  Kios  was  founded in 626/5.  A  Milesian  origin  is  invoked  as  a  reason  for  the isopoliteia  between  Miletos  (no. 854)  and  Kios  c. 228  (Milet. i.3141.6\u00ad7;  cf.  Plin.  HN 5.144),  and  foundation  by  Miletos  is further  indicated  by  a  phiale  which  the  Kians  dedicated  to Apollo  of  Didyma  in  276/5  (infra).  Also,  the  two  attested months-- (I.Kios 1.1)  and   (I.Kios 27)--suggest a M ilesian  origin  (Samuel  ( 1972)  117). According  to  Aristotle  (Arist.  fr. 519.1\u00ad2),  first a M ysian  and then  a  Karian  colony  preceded  the  Milesian  foundation  of Kios.  Aristotle  mentions  the  hero  Kios  as  the  oecist  of  the Milesian  foundation,  and  this  tradition  can  be  traced  back to  an  Attic  documentary  relief  (IG i\u00b3  124;  Lawton  ( 1995)  no. 9)  dated  406/5  and  representing  a  man  called  shak- ing  hands  with  the  helmeted  Athena  (Ehrhardt  ( 1995) 31\u00ad33).  According  to  a  different  tradition,  Kios  was  founded by  the  Argonaut  Polyphemos  with  Herakles'  approval.  This version  of  the  foundation  myth  is  known  from  Ap.  Rhod. 1.1321ff,  1345\u00ad57  and 4.1467ff,  but  its  earlier  origin  is  attested by  schol.  Ap.  Rhod. 4.1470,  which  quotes  the  C 4  historian Nymphodoros  of  Syracuse  ((FGrHist 572)  frr. 16  bis,  ter). Nothing  is  known  about  the  city's  early  history.  Kios  was under  Persian  domination  from  547/6  onwards.  It  took  part in  the  Ionian  Revolt  and  was  conquered  by  Hymaies  in  497 (Hdt. 5.122.1). At  an  unknown  date  Kios  joined  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  from 454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.vi.7)  to  418/17  (IG i\u00b3  287.ii.12)  a  total  of twelve  times,  twice  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  265.ii.48).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4 (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.89,heavily  restored).  Before  408  (Xen.  Hell. 1.4.7) Kios  came  under  Persian  control.  It  may  have  joined  the Delian  League  once  again  in  406/5  after  the  Athenian  victo- ry  at  Arginusai  (Attic  relief:  IG i\u00b3  124  Meyer  ( 1989)  272  A 22  Lawton  ( 1995)  no. 9;  Ehrhardt  ( 1995)  31\u00ad33).  But  after 404  Kios  was  certainly  under  Persian  domination  (Corsten ( 1985)  25). The  Aristotelian  collection  of  constitutions  included  a    (Arist.  fr. 519).  Two  honorific decrees, both  of  C 4m  (I.Kios 1,2),testify  to  democratic  institutions:  a popular  assembly  ([ ]  ) presided over by a prytanis,  passing  bills  moved  by  boards  of  archontes  and strategoi,  and  to  be  published  in  a  sanctuary  of  Athena.  The eponymous  magistrate  was  a  (I.Kios 1.1,  2.1;  cf. Corsten ( 1985)  50\u00ad51).A  board  of  hieropoioi  (I.Kios 1.15)  and a  board  of,  probably,  synedroi  (I.Kios 25.3  (C 4m))  are  also attested.  The  Kianoi  granted  proxenia  to a  citizen  of  Sigeion (no. 791)  (I.Kios 1  (C 4)),  and  some  citizens  of  Kios  were 982 avram awarded  proxenia  by  Karthaia  (no. 492)  (IG xii.5542.58 (C 4m)).  From  337  to 302  Kios  was  ruled  by  Mithridates  II (Diod. 20.111.4;  cf.  Corsten  ( 1985)  30;Debord ( 1999)  101\u00ad2). C. 330  a  theorodokos  was  appointed  to  host  theoroi  from Argos  (no. 347)  (SEG 23  189.ii.14). Given  the  Milesian  origin  of  the  city,  Apollo  was  presum- ably  the  patron  deity  of  Kios.  The  god  is  represented  on coins  (infra)  and  his  cult  is  implicitly  attested  by  the  com- munal  dedication  of  a     to Apollo  from Didyma  in  276/5  (I.Didyma  no. 427.6\u00ad7). Kios  struck  coins  from  C 4m:  ( 1)  silver  drachms  on  the Rhodian  standard,  followed  by ( 2)  gold  staters  on  the  Attic standard,  and  ( 3)  silver  drachms,  hemidrachms  and  quar- ter-drachms  on  the  Persian  standard.  Types:  obv.  head  of Apollo,  r.;  rev.  prow  ornamented  with  star.  Legend:  ( 1) ,(2) signature of  official,  e.g.  , ( 3) and  signature  of  official.

The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  285.ii.83;  Hdt. 4.144.1)  or  in  Doric  (coins,  infra;  IG ii\u00b2  8949 (C 4s);  SEG 31  1062  (undated))  or  (Aen.  Tact. 12.3;  Arist.  Pol. 1266a39)  or  (IG i\u00b3  263.v.17; I.Kalchedon 101.1  (Imperial)).  Kalchedon  is  attested  as  a  polis both  in  the  urban  sense  (Xen.  Hell. 1.3.5\u00ad6;  Ps.-Skylax 92; Arist.  Oec. 1347b20)  and  in  the  political  sense  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.31;Aen.Tact.  12.2,  4;  Arist.  Oec. 1347b20,  23,  29;  Orat. Adespota  fr. 8,  Sauppe).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic is  attested  internally  in  abbreviated  form  on  C 4  coins  (infra) and  externally  in  e.g.  IG i\u00b3  263.v.17  and 285.ii.83.  The  indi- vidual  and  external  use  is  attested  by  Plato's  mention  of \u00b5  (Resp. 328B)  and  Aristotle's of (Pol. 1266a39).  The  territory of Kalchedon  ( :  Hdt. 6.33.2)  is  called  (Hdt. 4.85.1;Xen.  Hell. 1.1.22,  An. 6.6.38).  Patris  is  found  in Thrasymachos  T 8,  DK. According  to  Euseb.  Chron. 93b,  Helm,  Kalchedon  was founded  in  685.  Hdt. 4.144.1  reports  that  the  city  was  found- ed  seventeen  years  before  Byzantion  (no. 674)  and  that  the colonisers  were  said  to  have  been  \"blind\"  because  they  had not  realised  the  advantages  of  the  European  shore  of  the Bosporos  (the  later  Byzantion);  cf.  Caecorum  oppidum (Plin.  HN 5.149).All  sources  agree  that  Megara  (no. 225)  was the  metropolis  (Thuc. 4.75.2).  Pompon. 1.101  calls  the  oecist (auctor)  Archias  Megarensium  princeps.  The  city's  history  is blank  down to C 6l.In  514/13  Dareios  crossed  the  Bosporos  at Kalchedon  (Hdt. 4.85.1,  87.2),  but  when  the  king  returned  to Asia  after  the  failed  Scythian  expedition,  he  destroyed  the city  because  the  Kalchedonians  allegedly  had  intended  to demolish  the  bridge  (Ktesias  (FGrHist 688)  fr. 13.21;Polyaen. 7.11.5,  see  Merle  ( 1916)  11;  Merkelbach  ( 1980)  92,  120; Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  88\u00ad89).  The  main  source  for  these events  (Hdt. 4.143.1)  indicates  the  Hellespont  for  Dareios' retreat,  but  Loukopoulou  argues  that  Dareios  first punished Kalchedon  and  then  for  security  reasons  chose  the Hellespontine  route.  Some  years  later  Kalchedon  was  taken by  the  satrap  Otanes  (Hdt. 5.26).  The  regime  established  by the  propontic  coast  of  asia  minor  979 the  Persians  may  have  induced  the  Kalchedonians  to  join  the Ionian  Revolt.  This  is  only  suggested  by  Hdt. 5.103.2 (          ), but  Kalchedonian  participation  in  the  Revolt  is  securely established  by  the  fact  that  in  493  some  of  the  Kalchedonians fled t o  Mesambria  on  the  Pontos  Euxeinos  when  the  city  was attacked  by  a  Persian\u00adPhoenician  fleet (see M esambria  (no. 687)  and  infra).  Pausanias'  conquest  of  Byzantion  in  478 (Thuc. 1.94.2)  probably  marks  the  end  of  Persian  supremacy over  Kalchedon  (Merkelbach  ( 1980)  92). At  an  unknown  date  Kalchedon  joined  the  Delian  League. It  belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded from  453/2  (IG i\u00b3  260.vii.12)  to  418/17  (IG i\u00b3  287.ii.16)  a  total of  nineteen  times,  once  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros of 7\u0153  tal.  ( 452/1),  3  tal.  ( 450/49),  9  tal.  ( 448\u00ad438)  and  6  tal. ( 434\u00ad429).  It  was  perhaps  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3 71.iii.61,  completely  restored).  Kalchedon  fought  with Athens  in  424  (Thuc. 4.75.2),but  in  412  or 411  it  was  occupied by  a  Spartan  garrison  under  a  harmostes  (Plut.  Alc. 29.6; Diod. 13.66.2).  Except  for  a  short  break  in  409  (Xen.  Hell. 1.3.1\u00ad12)  Kalchedon  remained  under  Spartan  occupation (Xen.  Hell. 2.2.1  (r 405))  until  389,  when  Thrasyboulos restored  Athenian  control  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.27\u00ad28).  In  387  it was  conquered  once  again  by  Sparta  (no. 345)  (Xen.  Hell. 5.1.25;Polyaen.  2.24).  By  the  King's  Peace  of 387/6  Kalchedon fell  to  Persia,  and  in  357  it  was  conquered  by  Byzantion (Dem. 15.26;  Theopomp.  fr. 62).  In  362  Kalchedon, Byzantion  and  Kyzikos  (no. 747)  had  been  allied  with Thebes  (no. 221)  and  captured  Athenian  merchantmen (Dem. 50.6,  17;  cf.  Arist.  Oec. 1347b20\u00ad30).  However,  a  crown dedicated  to  Athena  in  Athens  by  the  Kalchedonian  state indicates  friendly  relations  with  Athens  in  354/3  (IG ii\u00b2 1437.16).  At  an  unknown  date  in  C 4f,  perhaps  the  360s, Kalchedon  was  besieged  and  assisted  by  a  contingent  of Kyzikene  soldiers  (Aen.  Tact. 12.3;  cf.  P  Oxy. 303)  and  so  was probably  allied  to Kyzikos.  In C 4l  Kalchedon  joined  the   '  (L.  Robert  ( 1966)  31,  39). The  only  thing  we  know  about  the  type  of  constitution  is that,  as  a  result  of  the  conquest  of  Kalchedon  by Byzantion in 357,  a moderate  form  of  constitution  was  changed  into  a radical  democracy  (Theopomp.  fr. 62).  Civic  subdivisions are  attested  in  Hellenistic  sources  only  (especially I.Kalchedon 6  and 7),  but  since  they  are  of  Megarian  origin, they  may  go  back  to the  foundation  of  Kalchedon  in  C 7e. The  citizen  body  was  subdivided  into,  probably,  hundreds ( ;  cf.  Jones,  POAG 283\u00ad84;  Loukopoulou  ( 1989) 141\u00ad42).  The  names  of  several  of  the  hundreds  are  attested  as  sub-ethnics  in  Hellenistic  dedications,  e.g.   `  (I.Kalchedon 7.11).  The  presence  of metics  is  attested  in  Arist.  Oec. 1347b20\u00ad30. Some  of  the  known  officials are c ommon  for  all  (or  some) Megarian  foundations;  consequently  the  Hellenistic  sources can  be  interpreted  retrospectively.  This  applies  to  the  epony- mous  magistrate,  called  basileus  (I.Kalchedon 7.1,  8.1).  A hieromnamon  (I.Kalchedon 4.5,  7,  42)  is  not  attested  at Megara (no. 225);  at  Byzantion  he  was  the  eponymous  mag- istrate;  while  at  Kalchedon  he  clearly  accompanied  the basileus  (Hanell  ( 1934)  151)  and  indicates  a  Kalchedonian origin  for  the  Byzantine  hieromnamon  (Loukopoulou ( 1989)  145\u00ad46).Also  of  Megarian  origin  were  the  aisymnatai. Like  the  Athenian  prytaneis,  they  were  perhaps  members  of the  Council  (I.Kalchedon 10.10)  selected  by  lot  every  month (I.Kalchedon 6.1\u00ad2).  One  of  them  seems  to  have  been  the \u00b5   (I.Kalchedon 7.8;  see  Hanell  ( 1934)  150; Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  145).The  council  itself  ( ),  as  well as  the  assembly  ( \u00b5),  is  attested  in  I.Kalchedon 1  (C 2e) and 10  (C 3\u00adC2).  A  board  of  strategoi  (I.Kalchedon 1.73\u00ad74) may  also  go  back  to  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods.  Since Kalchedon  was  a  Megarian  colony,  a  number  of  attested civic  subdivisions  may  be  evidence  of  hekatostyes (I.Kalchedon 6  and 7;see supra).  Citizens  of  Kalchedon  were granted  proxenia  by  Karthaia  (no. 492)  (IG xii.5542.10 (C 4m))  and  Pantikapaion  (no. 705)  (IOSPE ii  2  CIRB 2 (C 4s)). Kalchedon  is  located  on  the  promontory  Kadik\u00f6y,  on  the Asiatic  shore  of  modern  Istanbul.  The  ancient  topography  is imperfectly  known  (see  a  plan  at  Merkelbach  ( 1980)  143). However,  mediaeval  testimonies  attest  remains  of  a  harbour between  Kadik\u00f6y  and  Haidar  Pa \u017esa  (Ruge  ( 1919a)  1558);  a cemetery  has  been  identified (Asgari and Firatli ( 1978));  and some  inscriptions  and  architectural  or  sculptural  remains have  been  found  by  chance  or  through  minor  excavations (see  also  M\u00fcller-Wiener  ( 1977)).  City  walls  are  explicitly mentioned  by Polyaen. 7.11.5  (r 513)  and  can  be  inferred  from the  numerous  sieges  of  Kalchedon  (Xen.  Hell. 1.3.4  ( 409); Polyaen. 2.24  (r 387);  Aen.  Tact. 12.3  ( 360s?);  Diod. 19.60.3 (r 315)).  Evidence  for  public  architecture  is  late,  and  the  lack of  excavations  does  not  allow  a  closer  examination  of  the  lit- erary  and  epigraphic  testimonies.  The  town  had  two  har- bours,  one  on  each  side  of  the  peninsula  (Dionysios  of Byzantion 111  p. 33,  G\u00fcngerich),  but  the  most  important seems  to  have  been  the  unlocated   \u00b5  (Diod. 18.72.4  (r 318);  Dionysios  of  Byzantion  99  p. 31,  G\u00fcngerich; Steph.  Byz. 672.15,  quoting  Nymphis  of  Herakleia  (C 4\u00adC3)). Oberhummer  ( 1897)  753  suggests  that  the  Phrixos  harbour was  located  at  Kanli\u00e7e  at  the  far  end  of  the  Bosporos. 980 avram The  most  important  and  best-attested  settlement  in  the territory  of  Kalchedon  is  Chrysopolis,  located  at  \u00dcsk\u00fcdar (former  Skutari)  (Xen.  Hell. 1.1.22,  1.3.12,  An. 6.6.38;Diod. 14.31.4  (r 400);  P  Oxy. 303).  In  410/9  it  was  fortified b y Alkibiades  (Xen.  Hell. 1.1.22;  cf.  Diod. 13.64.2\u00ad3).  Another settlement  ( ) called   \u00b5  is  mentioned  in  schol. Ap.  Rhod. 2.159b,  quoting  Androitas  of  Tenedos  (C 4\u00adC3). Of  sanctuaries  in  Chalkedon's  territory,  the  most  famous was  the  hieron  (Dem. 20.36,  35.10,  50.17  and 58;  Ps.-Skylax 67 and 92)  at  the  Euxine  end  of  the  Bosporos  (located  at Anadolu  Kavagi-Yenimahalle).  According  to  the  tradition, Jason  sacrificed here when he r eturned  from  Kolchis  (Pind. Pyth. 4.203\u00ad7;  Polyb. 4.39.6)  and  various  testimonies  record a  sanctuary  of    (Arr.  Peripl.M.Eux. 12,  25)  and the  Twelve  Gods  (Polyb. 4.39.6,  50.2)  with  an  altar  Syll. \u00b3 1010  (I.Kalchedon 13  (C 3)).Diod.20.111.3  (r 302)  shows  that the  sanctuary  belonged  to  Kalchedon,  though  it  was  repeat- edly  claimed  (and  sometimes  also  occupied)  by  Byzantion (no. 674)  (Polyb. 4.50.2\u00ad3).  An  extra-urban  sanctuary  of Herakles  remains  unlocated  (Xen.  Hell. 1.3.7  (r 409)).  His priest  is  attested  at  Syll. \u00b31011  I.Kalchedon 10.4  and 11 (C 3\u00adC2).  There  is  no  early  evidence  for  the  sanctuary  of Artemis  (Ptol.  Geog. 5.2)  located  more  likely  at  Phrixos (Hanell  ( 1934)  184;Avram  ( 1998\u00ad2000))  than  at  Chrysopolis (Merkelbach  ( 1980)  131). As  in  the  metropolis  Megara  (no. 225),  the  patron  deity  of Kalchedon  was  Apollo  Pythios  or  Chresterios  (I.Kalchedon 5.5),  whose  priest  ( )  is  mentioned  in  inscriptions side  by  side  with  the  highest  city  officials:  the  basileus  and  the hieromnamon  (I.Kalchedon 7.3).His  sanctuary  was  the  oldest in  the  city  (Luc.  Pseudomantis 10;  Dionysios  of  Byzantion  111 p. 35,  G\u00fcngerich;  see  also  SEG 4720)  and  was  declared by  Delphi  (Syll. \u00b3550  (C 2l)).  An  attempt  to  recon- struct  the  local  calendar,  based  on  comparison  with  the  other Megarian  colonies,  is  proposed  by  Avram  ( 1999)  30. The  first silver c oins  of  Kalchedon  were  minted c. 387/6\u00ad340  on  the  Rhodian  standard.

For  the chronology,  see  Le  Rider  ( 1963)  44\u00ad50.  The  close  relation- ship  to  Byzantion  is  illustrated  by  the  fact  that  the  types  of these  series  are  quite  similar  to  Byzantine  types;  they  \"differ only  in  one  respect,  viz.  that  the  bull  on  the  money  of Byzantium  stands  upon  a  dolphin,  while  at  Calchedon  he stands  upon  an  ear  of  corn\"  (Head,  HN \u00b2512).  The  sympo- liteia  with  Byzantion  of 357  is  attested  in  the  C 3\u00adC2  bronze coins  with  the  legend     (Sch\u00f6nert- Geiss  ( 1970)  78\u00ad80  nos. 1252\u00ad1301  pl. 59\u00ad62;Price ( 1993)  pl.

Kalchedon  was  involved  in  three  colonial  foundations, but  only  one  of  them  can  be  considered  a  purely Kalchedonian  colony,  viz.( 1)  Astakos  (no. 737),  founded  in C 7  according  to  Charon  of  Lampsakos  (FGrHist 262)  fr. 6. ( 2)  Kalchedonian  participation  in  the  foundation  of Byzantion  (no. 674)  is  indicated  by  Hesychios  of  Miletos ((FGrHist 390)  frr. 20\u00ad23;  cf.  Hanell  ( 1934)  123\u00ad28)  and  by the  existence  of  the  office of  hieromnamon  both  at Kalchedon  and  Byzantion  compared  with  its  absence  at Megara (no. 225)  (Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  146).  Nevertheless, the  idea  of  a  direct  foundation  of  Byzantion  by  Kalchedon (Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  52,  146)  remains  a  hypothesis. ( 3)  Jointly  with  Megara  (no. 225),  Kalchedon  founded Mesambria  in  C 6l,  at  the  time  of  Dareios'  campaign  against the  Scythians  (Ps.-Skymnos  739\u00ad42;  cf.  Anon.  Peripl.  M. Eux. 83\u00ad84,  Diller),  and  in  493  the  colonists  were  reinforced by  refugees  from  Byzantion  and  Kalchedon  (Hdt. 6.33);  see Mesambria  (no. 687)  and  Avram  ( 1996)  290\u00ad92. 744.

(IG i\u00b3  278.vi.34);  there- after  the  city  is  listed  as  having  been  assessed  by  the  boule and  a  dikasterion  in 430/29  (restored  in  IG i\u00b3  281.iii.65)  and in 429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.48).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4 (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.80). The  Bysbikenians  inhabited  the  island  of situ- ated  in  the  Sea  of  Marmara  outside  the  mouth  of  the  river Rhyndakos  (Ps.-Skylax  94;  Plin.  HN 5.151:  circumference  18 Roman  miles)  and  probably  to  be  identified w ith  modern I . mrali  Adasi  (Hasluck  ( 1910)  53\u00ad55),  which,  however,  has  a circumference  of  no  more  than  13  Roman  miles.  For  a  differ- ent  identification,  see  the  garbled  passage  at  Strabo  12.8.11 and  Amm.  Marc. 22.8.6.  If  we  can  trust  some  of  Strabo's  gar- bled  account,  Besbikos  was  a  dependency  of  Kyzikos  (no. 747),  a  piece  of  information  which  may  be  linked  to  the tradition  that  Kore  (whose  worship  is  attested  in  Kyzikos  by coins  from  C 4  onwards)  played  an  important  role  in  the  bat- tle  of  the  Giants  (cf.  L.  Robert  ( 1987)  166). Quoting  Agathokles  of  Kyzikos  ((FGrHist 472)  fr. 2  (C 3)), Steph.  Byz. 165.10\u00ad166.5  says  that  the  island  originally  was  a stone  thrown  by  the  Giant  Besbikos  and  transformed  into an  island  by  his  opponent,  the  goddess  Kore.Agathokles  also reports  what  must  be  a  rival  foundation  myth  according  to which  Besbikos  was  a  Pelasgian  (T\u00fcmpel  ( 1897)). So  far  no  remains  of  an  ancient  town  have  been  found  on the  island,  but  its  classification b y  Agathokles  as  a  \u00b5 indicates  some  kind  of  nucleated  settlement. 739.

The  toponym  is  completely  restored  in  the  assess- ment  decree  of 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.102).  Under  Persian  domi- nation  from,  at  latest,  the  King's  Peace  of 387/6,Zeleia supported  the  Persians  against  Alexander  the  Great  in  334 but  obtained  an  amnesty  from  the  conqueror  (Arr.  Anab. 1.17.2).  Some  decrees  passed  in  the  wake  of  the  battle  of Granikos  testify  to  a  democratic  constitution  (infra). Finally,  like  many  other  settlements  in  the  region,  Zeleia  was eventually  subdued  by  Kyzikos  (no. 747)  (Strabo  13.1.5;  cf. 12.4.6,  13.1.10)  and,  probably,  turned  into  a  fort  ( ) in  the  Kyzikene  territory  (cf.  Steph.  Byz. 295.7). Almost  all  information  about  institutions,  officials,  cults and  calendar  stems  from  two  inscriptions  (SGDI 5532  Syll. \u00b3279  Michel 530  and  SGDI 5533  Michel 531) connected  with  the  establishment  of  a  democratic  regime after  334  (cf.  Lolling  ( 1881),  ( 1884)  58\u00ad60).  They  attest  a popular  assembly  called  \u00b5  ( 5532.1,  5533b\u00adf),  an ( 5532.1,  5533b\u00ade),  the  \"officials\"  ( : 5532.22,  33,  38), and []  ( 5532.27,  30\u00ad32; see  also  \u00b5:  11,  26,  34; \u00b5:  13).  SGDI 5532  and 5533f concern  the  regulation  of  the  possession  of  public  land  (cf. \u00b5 :  5532  passim).  The  reference  to land belonging  to  exiles  testifies t o  a  stasis  in  connection  with  the change  of  constitution  (   \u00b5 :  5533f). The  decrees  SGDI 5533a\u00adc  grant  politeia,  ateleia  and  proedria to foreigners; 5533d  grants  politeia,  land,  ateleia  and  proedria to  an  inhabitant  of  Zeleia;  while  5533e  grants  land  (as  above), ateleia  and  proedria  to  a  Zeleian  citizen.  Of  the  foreigners honoured,  one  is  a  proxenos  of  Zeleia  in  Eresos  (no. 796) ( 5533c)  and  one  is  from  Thourioi  (no. 74)  ( 5533b). the  propontic  coast  of  asia  minor  995 SGDI 5532  mentions  the  acropolis  of  the  city  ( 6\u00ad7),  the sanctuary  of  Apollo  Pythios  ( 36\u00ad37)  as  well  as  other  public sanctuaries  ( 38).

Before  the  colonisation  of  Lampsakos  in  C 7m  the toponym  seems  to  have  been  (Charon  of Lampsakos  (FGrHist 262)  fr. 7a)  or  (Hom.  Il. 2.829; schol.  Ap.  Rhod. 1.933;  Steph.  Byz. 410.18,  quoting  Deiochos of  Kyzikos  (C 5\u00adC4)).  It  is  possible  that  the  Homeric existed  before  the  proper  foundation  of Lampsakos  (infra).  The  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5 (I.Lampsakos 1.20  (c. 300)).  Lampsakos  is  called  a  polis  both in  the  urban  sense  (Hdt. 5.117.1;Xen.  Hell. 2.1.19;  in  Ps.- Skylax 94  Lampsakos  is  one  of  the  toponyms  listed  after  the heading  ` ) and in the political sense (I.Lampsakos 1.20  (c. 300),  8.2\u00ad4  (C 4?);  Arist.

The  collective  use  of  the  city- ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  abbreviated  form  on  coins (infra)  and  in  inscriptions  (I.Lampsakos 1.20)  and  externally at  Hdt. 6.37\u00ad38;  Thuc. 8.62.2;Xen.

Patris  is  found  in  Dem. 23.142. Lampsakos  is  located  at  modern  Lapseki  (Turkish  name), which  has  preserved  the  ancient  toponym.  Some  testi- monies  of  the  eighteenth  century  attest  walls  and  architec- tural  remains  (but  Texier  ( 1862)  174\u00ad76  reported  that  he found  no  ancient  monument  in  1835),  while  various  objects continue  to  be  found  occasionally:  Leaf  ( 1923)  93\u00ad97; B\u00fcrchner  ( 1924b)  591;  MacKay  ( 1976)  480  and  map  7; Mitchell ( 1999)  142.  The  best  evidence  is  produced  by inscriptions  (Frisch  ( 1978)),  but  almost  all  are  of  the Hellenistic  and  Roman  periods. The  territory  of  Lampsakos  was  originally  called after  the  name  of  the  native  (Charon (FGrHist 262)  fr. 8;  cf.  fr. 7a).  The  countryside  was  renowned for  its  vineyards  (Thuc. 1.138.5;Diod.11.57.7  (r 464)).The  ter- ritory  (B\u00fcrchner  ( 1924a);  Frisch  ( 1978)  105\u00ad7)  was  bordered to  the  west  by  Perkote  (no. 788)  (  modern  Umurbey)  situ- ated  c. 12  km  from  Lampsakos,  and  to  the  north-east  by Paisos,  c. 12  km  from  Lampsakos  and  incorporated  after 425/4  (see  Paisos  (no. 755)).According  to  an  anecdote  told  by Polyaen. 6.24  the  frontier  between  Lampsakos  and  Parion (no. 756)  was  placed  at  Hermaion modern  Otlukdere,  c. 10 km  south  of  Parion,  according  to Leaf  ( 1923)  100\u00ad1  to be identified w ith  Hermoton  (Arr.

There  is  evidence  of  a  number  of  settlements  in  the  terri- tory  of  Lampsakos. was  probably  a  dependent polis  (Arr.  Anab. 1.12.6  (r 334);  Strabo  13.1.19)  and  perhaps  a secondary  colony  founded  by  Lampsakos  (see  no. 746). \u00b5  (Steph.  Byz. 164.8\u00ad9,  quoting  Polemon:   \u00b5) and '  (schol.  Eur.  Med. 484)  were perhaps  situated  close  to  Lampsakos. or  was  a  settlement  near  the  homonymous  promontory (Hecat.  fr. 220;Xen.  Hell. 2.1.29;Ephor.  fr. 46),  tentatively located  c. 8  km  north  of  Lampsakos,  at  \u00c7ardak  Burnu  (Leaf ( 1923)  93);  according  to  Steph.  Byz. 4.4,  it  was  a  polis.  Other settlements  are  attested  only  in  late  sources. Lampsakos  was  founded  in  654/3  (Euseb.  Chron. 95d, Helm;  Synkellos  213b,  p. 402,  Dindorf)  by colonists  from Phokaia  (no. 859)  (Charon  of  Lampsakos  (FGrHist 262)  fr. 7a  and  b;  Polyaen. 8.37;  Steph.  Byz. 4.13\u00ad14,quoting  Ephor.  fr. 46).That  Phokaia  was  the  metropolis  is  confirmed b y  the  tra- dition  that  the  citizens  of  Lampsakos  called  themselves brothers  of  the  Massaliotai  (cf.  Massalia  (no. 3),  so  a Phokaian  colony;  I.Lampsakos 4.26),  and  by  the  name  of  the month  Heraion,  attested  both  in  Lampsakos  (I.Lampsakos 986 avram 8.5)  and  Phokaia  (Samuel  ( 1972)  125,131).Strabo  13.1.19  erro- neously  states  that  Lampsakos  was  colonised  from  Miletos (no. 854). In C 6m  Lampsakos  was  a  dependency  of  Lydia,  and  when the  Lampsakenes  had  captured  Miltiades,  the  Athenian tyrant  of  the  Chersonese,  they  were forced  by Kroisos  to set him  free  (Hdt. 5.37\u00ad38).  After  the  fall  of  Lydia  in  547, Lampsakos  came  under  Persia;  in  499  the  city  joined  the Ionian  cities  in  their  Revolt,  and  the  winged  horse  on Lampsakos'  coins  was  used  by  the  Ionian  koinon  on  some  of their  issues  (Meiggs  ( 1972)  27);  but  Lampsakos  was  con- quered  by  Daurises  in  498  or 497  (Hdt. 5.117).  Lampsakos remained  under  Persian  domination,  and  in  464  it  was  given by  King  Artaxerxes  to  the  exiled  Themistokles  (Thuc. 1.138; Plut.  Them. 27.1,  29.11).  At  an  unknown  date  Lampsakos joined  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the  Hellespontine district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  453/2  (IG i\u00b3 260.v.17:[ \u00b5]  )  to  428/7  (IG i\u00b3  283  pars  aversa 37) a  total  of  thirteen  times,  three  times  completely  restored, paying  in  most  years  a  phoros  of 15  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  262.iv.5),  in 447/6  reduced to 3,600  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  265.ii.59)  and  in  442/1  to 9 tal.  (IG i\u00b3  270.ii.6).  It  was  perhaps  assessed  for  tribute  in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.176,  completely  restored).  The  quota  of 12 tal.  would  suggest  that  the  income  from  the  gold  mines  was taken  into  account  (Ruschenbusch  ( 1983)  143).  After  430/29 the  citizens  of  Paisos  (no. 755)  were  moved  to  Lampsakos (Strabo  13.1.19:    \u00b5  \u00b5),  and  Kolonai  (no. 746)  may  have suffered  a similar  fate. Lampsakos  supported  Athens  during  the  first stages of the  Peloponnesian  War,  then  went  over  to  the  Persians  (who were  allies  of  the  Spartans);  but  in  411  the  city  was  conquered by  the  Athenian  strategos  Strombichides  (Thuc. 8.62)  and continued  to  be  allied  with  Athens  (Xen.  Hell. 2.1.18).  It  was conquered  by  Lysandros  in  405  shortly  before  Aigos  pota- moi  (no. 658)(Xen.  Hell. 2.1.18\u00ad21,  30  and 2.2.1).  The  city remained  under  Spartan  hegemony  until  the  mid- 390s (Xen.  Hell. 3.2.2\u00ad5).  Some  Lampsakene  gold  staters  (obv. Herakles  strangling  the  serpents,  infra)  indicate  that Lampsakos  in  394  presumably  joined  the  so-called  Herakles Coinage  Alliance  between  Rhodes  (no. 1000),  Knidos  (no. 903),  Iasos  (no. 891),  Ephesos  (no. 844),  Samos  (no. 864), Byzantion  (no. 674)  and  Kyzikos  (no. 747)  (Seltman  ( 1933) pl. 32.12;  Cawkwell  ( 1956);  Karwiese  ( 1980),  dating  the alliance  to  the  last  years  of  the  Peloponnesian  War;  Frisch ( 1978)  122;Debord ( 1999)  273\u00ad77). Like  all  other  cities  of  Asia  Minor,  Lampsakos  fell  to  Persia by  the  King's  Peace  of 387/6.  Together  with  other Hellespontine  cities,  it  belonged  to  the  satrapy  ruled  from Daskyleion,  conceded  by  Ariobarzanes  to  the  hyparchos Philiskos  of  Abydos,  who  was  killed  by  two  citizens  of Lampsakos  (Dem. 23.142).  During  the  Social  War  ( 357\u00ad355) Lampsakos  was  conquered  by  the  Athenian  strategos  Chares (Dem. 2.28;  schol.  Dem.  Olynth. 3.31),  and  in  the  340s  it  was ruled  by  Memnon  of  Rhodes  (Arist.  Oec. 2.1351b1;  cf.  Frisch ( 1978)  127).  From  c. 310  onwards  Lampsakos  was  a  member of  the    '  (L.  Robert  ( 1966)  18\u00ad46). Moreover,  a kind  of  sympoliteia  with  Ilion  (no. 779)  is  probably  attested  by  a  unique  silver  tridrachm:  obv.  head  of  Athena  wearing  Corinthian  helmet,  r.;  rev.  winged  horse r.  under  the  horse: (),  above  it: () (Frisch (1975) XV,  ( 1978)  129\u00ad30  (c. 300)). A  tradition  that  Lampsakos  was  originally  ruled  by  kings is  reported  by  Charon  of  Lampsakos  ((FGrHist 262)  fr. 7ab). After  the  Persian  conquest,  c. 513,  Lampsakos  was  ruled  by  a tyrant,  Hippoklos  (Hdt. 4.138.1).  His  son  Aiantides  married Archedike,  the  daughter  of  Hippias,  the  tyrant  of  Athens (Thuc. 6.59.3),  and  the  epigram  on  Archedike's  gravestone (Thuc. 6.59.3  I.Lampsakos 24a  (C 5e))  testifies t o  a  third generation  of  tyrants  (Frisch  ( 1978)  113\u00ad14).We  have  no  fur- ther  information  about  the  constitution  of  Lampsakos  until C 4f,  when  we  hear  about  another  tyrant,  Astyanax,  who  was overturned  and  killed  (Aen.  Tact. 31.33,  tentatively  dated  to c. 355  by  Berve  ( 1967)  313).  A  few  years  later  a  pupil  of  Plato, Euaion,  held  the  acropolis  as  security  for  a  public  debt. He  attempted  to  set  up  a  tyranny,  but  was  eventually  paid  off  and  expelled  (Ath. 508F;  cf.  Berve  ( 1967)  312\u00ad13). Inscriptions  attesting  democratic  institutions  all  belong  in the  Hellenistic  period;  see  especially  I.Lampsakos 4.34.  Only I.Lampsakos 1  and 8  may  perhaps  be  dated  as  early  as  C 4  (for the  date  of 8,  see  Wilhelm  ( 1974)  46\u00ad48).  In  these  inscrip- tions  we  learn  about  a  popular  assembly  called  demos;  cf.  the statue  of  Anaximenes  of  Lampsakos  set  up  in  Olympia  by  \u00b5  \u00b5  (Paus. 6.18.2  (rC 4s)). Furthermore,  the  inscriptions  mention  a  council  (boule),  a tamias,  a board  called       ,  and  an  envoy elected  by  a  show  of  hands  (Rhodes,  DGS 412\u00ad14).  In  346  a citizen  of  Lampsakos  was  sent  by  the  Odrysian  dynast Kersobleptes  to  Athens  (Aeschin. 2.83).  Citizens  of Lampsakos  became  proxenoi  at  Chios  (no. 840)  (Vanseveren ( 1937)  325  A. 10\u00ad11  (C 4m)),at  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.151 (C 4))  and  at  Athens  (no. 361)  (IG ii\u00b2  205  ( 351/50)).  In  C 4s Lampsakos  had  a  theorodokos  to  host  theoroi  from  Nemea (SEG 36  331.B.26  ( 331/30\u00ad313)). The  acropolis  of  Lampsakos  is  mentioned  at  Ath. 508F (r 350).  The  city  was  not  yet  fortified when it was c onquered the  propontic  coast  of  asia  minor  987 by the  Athenians  in  411  (Thuc. 8.62.2),  and  the  first defence circuit  was  erected  by  the  Athenians  under  Thrasyllos  and Alkibiades  in  409  (Xen.  Hell. 1.2.14;  cf.  Diod. 13.66).  These walls  are  also  mentioned  by  Plut.  Lys. 9.5  in  connection  with the  conquest  of  the  city  by  the  Spartan  commander  in  405. The  city  also  had  a  harbour  (Strabo  13.1.18). The  patron  deity  was  Priapos  (Paus. 9.31.2;  cf.  the  testi- monies  collected  by Frisch  ( 1978)  150\u00ad52).A  cult  of  Dionysos is  attested  through  the  mention  of  a  sanctuary  for  Dionysos in  I.Lampsakos 8.6\u00ad7;  cf. 34.34\u00ad35.  A  local  agon  is  known from  a  C 5  bronze  hydria  inscribed      \u00b5 (LSAG \u00b2367  no. 47). The  earliest  coins  of  Lampsakos  (Head,  HN \u00b2529\u00ad30)  are electrum  staters  of  c. 525\u00ad500.  Types:  obv.  forepart  of  winged horse  (Pegasos),  above,  acanthus;  rev.  quadripartite  incuse square.  After  an  interruption,  Lampsakos  started  again  from c. 450  to  strike  electrum  staters  of  two  main  types  ( 1)  obv. forepart  of  winged  horse,  sometimes  in  vine  wreath;  rev. quadripartite  incuse  square;  ( 2)  obv.  Janiform  female  head of  Archaic  style;  rev.  head  of  Athena  in  incuse  square. Between  the  two  series  there  was  an  issue  of  lighter  standard, interpreted  as  a  local  coinage  connected  with  the  Ionian Revolt  (Baldwin  ( 1914);  Gaebler  ( 1922);  for  the  coinage  of the  Ionian  Revolt:  Gardner  ( 1911),  ( 1918)  91\u00ad103;Meiggs ( 1972)  441\u00ad42;  cf.  IGCH  no. 1167).  The  later  series  of  elec- trum  staters  is  also  mentioned  in  the  Athenian  accounts  of the  Parthenon  as  ~ ~  \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3 436\u00ad49  ( 447/6\u00ad433/2)).  The  local  gold  mines  mentioned  in Polyaen. 2.1.26  (r 396)  must  have  provided  the  metal  for  the gold  staters  struck  c. 390\u00ad330  on  the  Persian  standard.  Obv. different  types;  one  is  the  infant  Herakles  strangling  the  ser- pents  (cf.  supra);  Baldwin  ( 1920)  and,  for  the  chronology, Baldwin  ( 1924);  rev.  forepart  of  a  winged  horse  in  incuse square  (Head,  HN \u00b2529\u00ad30).  The  C 4  gold  staters,  referred  to as  \u00b5  [ ] (IG  vii 2418.9  Syll. \u00b3201)  became  almost  an  \"international\"  cur- rency  (Baldwin  ( 1924);  Regling  ( 1924)  590;  SNG  Cop.  Mysia 187).  Furthermore,  from  C 6l  to  C 4  (and  later)  Lampsakos struck  silver  staters  and  smaller  fractions  sometimes  on  the Persian,  sometimes  on  the  Attic  standard  (Gaebler  ( 1923);  cf. Le  Rider  ( 1963)  51,  55).  Bronze  coins  were  struck  in  C 4.  Obv. heads  of  different  deities;  rev.  mostly  forepart  of  winged horse;  legend: or (SNG  Cop.

Mir.  ausc. 834b34;  Menekrates  (FGrHist 701)  fr. 1).  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  77.iv.7). The  toponym  as  well  as  the  membership  of  the  Delian League  suggest  that  Pythopolis  was  originally  a  polis,but at Arist.  Mir.  ausc. 834b34  it  is  classified as a kome.  The  pre- sumption  is  that  the  polis  Pythopolis  was  subdued  by Kios (no. 745)  and  turned  into  a  civic  subdivison. Ps.-Aristotle  locates  Pythopolis  on  the  Askanian  lake (  I . znik  G\u00f6l\u00fc), 120  stades  from  Kios,  and  considers  it  a  \"vil- lage\",  apparently  a  second-order  settlement  in  the  territory of  Kios.  According  to  Menekrates  (FGrHist 701)  fr. 1,  it  was close  to  the  river  Soloeis.  A  combination  of  these  two sources  suggests  a  location  at  the  village  of  S\u00f6l\u00f6z,  on  the south  shore  of  I . znik  G\u00f6l\u00fc  (Corsten  ( 1987)  148\u00ad49). The  Pythopolitai  are  recorded  among  the  Hellespontine members  in  the  Athenian  assessment  decree  of 422/1  (IG i\u00b3 77.iv.7),  and  the  city-ethnic  is  restored  in  the  assessment decree  of 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.117).Thus,the  Athenians  claimed that  they  were  members  of  the  Delian  League. According  to  Menekrates  (FGrHist 701)  fr. 1,  Pythopolis had  been  founded  by  Theseus  and  named  after  the  Pythian Apollo. 761.  Skylake Map 52.  Lat. 40.25,long.  28.25.  Size  of  terri- tory:? Type:C: .  The  toponym  is  (Hecat.  fr. 218; Hdt. 1.57.2).  The  only  attestation  of  a  city-ethnic  is  at  Steph. Byz. 579.4.Quoting  Hekataios,  Steph.  Byz. 579.3\u00ad4  states  that Skylake  was  a  polis  near  Kyzikos: .  .`   .There is no reason to doubt the location,  but  we  have  no  guarantee  that  the  site-classifica- tion  stems  from  Hekataios  (Hansen  ( 1997)  17\u00ad18).  Thus,  the main  reason  for  including  Skylake  in  this  Inventory  of  poleis is  the  analogy  with  Plakia  (no. 757):  like  Plakia,  Skylake  is described  by  Hdt. 1.57.2  as  a  semi-barbarian  community  in which  Pelasgians  lived  side  by  side  with  Athenians. Herodotos'  account  implies  that  Skylake,  in  so  far  as  it  was  a Hellenic  community,  was  an  Athenian  foundation. From  the  information  provided  by Steph.  Byz. 579.3\u00ad4, Pompon. 1.98,  Plin.  HN 5.142,  and  Valerius  Flaccus, Argonautica 3.34\u00ad36,  we  must  presume  that  Skylake  was  sit- uated  near  Plakia  at  the  mouth  of  the  river  Rhyndakos (Lolling  ( 1882)  152  n. 2).  Philippson  ( 1913)  map  2  located Skylake  at  Yeni  K\u00f6y,  on  the  coast,  c. 12  km  west  of  the  mouth of  the  Rhyndakos.  The  city  seems  to  have  disappeared  very early  (B\u00fcrchner  ( 1927)),and  was  presumably  integrated  into Kyzikos  (no. 747). 762. ", "Miletoupolis": "Identifier: 751. , (Miletopolites) Map  52.  Lat. 40.05, long. 28.20.  Size  of  territory:  ?  Type:  B: .  The  toponym  is ,  (Strabo  12.8.10;  Suda 1061).  The  city- ethnic  is  (SNG  Cop.  Mysia 249)  or (I.Kyzikos ii  64  (second  century  ad)).  The earliest  attestation  of  Miletoupolis  as  a  polis  comes  from  a decree  of  the  first c entury  ad  (I.Kyzikos ii  25.2).But  polis  sta- tus  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  is  strongly  indicated by ( 1)  the  toponym,  ( 2)  the  C 4  mint,  and  ( 3)  the  cult  of  Zeus Polieus.  The  collective  and  internal  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  on  C 4  coins  (infra).  For  the  individual  and  external use,  see  an  Athenian  sepulchral  inscription  of  C 4f(SEG  18 120)  and  a  C 3  Milesian  citizenship  decree  (Milet. i.367.7). Combining  Strabo  12.8.10  with  the  evidence  of  coin  finds, it  is  now  generally  assumed  that  Miletoupolis  was  at  modern Melde  (Turkish  name), c. 5  km  north-west  of Mustafakemalpa \u017esa  (formerly  Kirmasti)  (Schwertheim ( 1983)  89\u00ad92).  Some  excavations  took  place  in  1975,but only Roman  monuments  were found  (ibid. 90,  127\u00ad28).  The Turkish  name  Melde  derives  from  Miletos,  through  Meletos (L.  Robert  ( 1962)  192). The  territory  of  the  city  was  bordered  to  the  north  by  the mountains  Kara  Daglari (including Lake Miletopolitis which  belonged  to  the  city  (Strabo  12.8.10)),  to  the  west  by the  hills  situated  east  of  Lake  Daskylitis,  to  the  south  by  the Rhyndakos  valley,  and  to  the  east  by  Lake  Apolloniatis, which  belonged  to  the  later  Apollonia  on  the  Rhyndakos  (L.  Robert  ( 1980)  97\u00ad98;  Schwertheim  ( 1983)  100\u00ad1).  At  the western  end  of  this  lake  lay  Miletou  Teichos  (no. 751),  a  for- tified settlement ( Hell.  Oxy. 25.3)  and  in  C 4  probably  a dependency  of  Miletoupolis. The  foundation  of  Miletoupolis  is  not  mentioned  in  any source. Some  late  coins  inscribed   indicate  that  the  city  was  named  after  a  hero founder  called  Miletos  (Schwertheim  ( 1983)  81  nos. 28\u00ad29). According  to  Nikolaos  of  Damaskos  (FGrHist 90)  fr. 63,  this Miletos,  probably  a  Milesian,  married  into  the  Lydian  royal family  but  went  into  exile  and  came  first t o  Daskyleion  (no. 740),later  to  Prokonnesos  (no. 759).If  we  can  trust  these  late sources,  Miletoupolis  was  a  Milesian  colony  and  probably 988 avram founded  in  C 7l/C6e  (Schwertheim  ( 1983)  102\u00ad6).  The  types used  for  the  coins,  the  calendar  used  by  the  Miletopolitai (infra),  as  well  as  a  late  sepulchral  inscription  referring  to \"Attic  blood\"  (I.Kyzikos  II 64  (second  century  ad))  testify  to close  ties  with  Athens. A  C 4  festival  calendar  (I.Kyzikos ii  1;  cf.  Schwertheim ( 1983)  107\u00ad12)  mentions  cults  of  Hermes,  Aphrodite,  Zeus Polieus,  Olympios  and  Agoraios,  Apollo  Karneios,  Herakles, (Herakles)  Alexikakos,  Eirene  and  Ilithyia  (midwife  god- dess).  However,  the  possibility  remains  that  the  stone  is  a pierre  errante  recording  the  calendar  of  an  Attic  deme (Habicht  ( 1999)  26\u00ad29).  The  calendar  records  sacrifices in the  month  of  Skirophorion,  elsewhere  attested  only  in Athens  and  Iasos  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 294)  and  thus  points  to Athenian  influence.  The  head  of  Athena  on  the  earliest  coins (infra)  may  indicate  a  cult  of  Athena. Miletoupolis  struck  bronze  coins  from  C 4  onwards  (Head, HN \u00b2  531;  Schwertheim  ( 1983)  78  nos. 1\u00ad6  and 8).  Types:  obv. head  of  Athena,  or  young  male,  r.;  rev.  bull,  or  owl;  legend: ,  or (BMC Mysia 91  nos. 1\u00ad5;  SNG  Cop.  Mysia 246\u00ad47). 751. ", "Sombia": "Identifier: 5 , Map 52.

(IG i\u00b3  285.ii.86,  amount  partly  restored).  It  was assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.113,  partly  restored) and  in  422/1  (IG i\u00b3  77.iv.3)  for  4,000  dr. The  position  of  Sombia  in  the  lists  strongly  suggests  that, within  the  Hellespontine  district,  it  was  located  somewhere in  the  Propontis,  rather  than  in  Troas  or  Chersonesos. Further  specification is impossible.  In  the  assessment decrees  Sombia  is  listed  together  with  communities  lying  on the  south  coast  (Tereia  (no. 763),  Artaiou  Teichos  (no. 735), Otlenoi  (no. 754)),  but  in  the  tribute  lists  it  is  placed  among communities,  some  of  which  were  on  the  north  coast (Daunion  Teichos,  Serrion  Teichos  and  Perinthos)  and some  on  the  south  coast  (Myrleia  and,  probably,  Didymon Teichos).  The  evidence  slightly  favours  a  position  on  the south  coast,  but  is--strictly speaking--inconclusive.  So  a location  on  the  north  coast  is  equally  possible. 763.Tereia  Map 52.  c.Lat. 40.25,long.  28.45,  unlocated  in Barr.  Size  of  territory:  ?

Thus,  the  Athenians claimed  that  Tereia  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League. According  to the  evidence  of  the  assessment  decree,  Tereia was  situated  east  of  Kyzikos  near  Myrleia  and  must  accord- ingly  be  different  from  the  Tereia  mentioned  by  Strabo  at 12.4.6  as  lying  west  of  Kyzikos  (ATL  i. 476;  Charneux  ( 1966) 211\u00ad12). 764.Zeleia  (Zeleites) Map  52.

Zeleia  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  in the  local  decree  SGDI 5532  Syll. \u00b3279.25,and  in  the  political sense  in  the  same  inscription  ( 15,  19,  39)  and  in  SGDI 5533a\u00adb,  d\u00ade  (both  from  c. 334).  In  both  inscriptions  are attested  the  cognate  terms  politai  (Syll. \u00b3279.3,  7,  28)  and politeia  (SGDI 5533a\u00add).  The  collective  and  internal  use  of the  city-ethnic  is  attested  on  coins  (infra),  the  external  sense in  Arr.  Anab. 1.17.2  (r 334).  For  the  individual  and  external use,  see  the  references  to \u00b5   (Dem. 9.42\u00ad43;  Aeschin. 3.258;  Din. 2.24;  cf.  Meiggs  ( 1972) 508\u00ad12). Strabo  locates  Zeleia  190  stades  from  Kyzikos  and  80 stades  from  the  sea  ( 13.1.10),  at  the  foot  of  Mt.  Ida  ( 13.1.5,  33), which  was  for  him  rather  a  mountain  range  separating  Troy from  Mysia  (Texier  ( 1862)  41).  The  site  has  been  identified with  Sari  K\u00f6y  (Turkish  name),  on  the  Sari  \u00c7ayi,  a  left-bank tributary  of  the  river  Aisepos  (  G\u00f6nen  \u00c7ayi):  Philippson ( 1910)  map  1;  Hasluck  ( 1910)  101\u00ad3;Leaf  ( 1923)  66\u00ad67;  ATL  i. 488. No  reliable  reconstruction  of  the  extent  of  Zeleia's territ- ory  can  be  obtained  from  Strabo's  contradictory  accounts  at 12.4.6,  13.1.10,  17,  45.  For  an  attempt,  see  Haussoullier  ( 1902) 107\u00ad8. Nothing  certain  is  known  about  the  foundation  of  Zeleia. It  was  not  a  Milesian  colony  (Bilabel  ( 1920)  47\u00ad49;  Ehrhardt ( 1988)  38).  Early  Ionian  Hellenisation  of  a  pre-existing  set- tlement  is  sometimes  presumed  (Bilabel  ( 1920)  49;  cf. L.  Robert  ( 1967)  122;  Herrmann  ( 1981)  17  n. 48).

The  toponym  is (IG i\u00b3  278.iv.7\u00ad8).  The  city-ethnic  is (IG i\u00b3  278.iv.9).  The  only  author  to  call Daskyleion  a  polis  is  Strabo  at  12.8.10,  but  the  reference  is  to his  own  time. Among  the  five homonymous sites r ecorded  by  Steph.  Byz. s.v.  Daskyleion  ( 220.9\u00ad17),  two  have  sometimes  been  con- fused  by  ancient  sources  (e.g.  Strabo  12.8.10)  and  modern authors  (e.g.  Ruge  ( 1901)):  .  .  . [sc. ]   [i.e.  the  polis  Daskyleion]. \u00b5      [i.e.  the  seat  of  the  Persian  satrapy].  Recent excavations  (reported  in  Mitchell  ( 1990)  89  and  ( 1999)  130) have  finally c onfirmed the identification  of  the  satrap's  resi- dence  with  the  mound  called  Hisartepe  near  Ergili,  on  the south-western  shore  of  the  Manyas  G\u00f6l\u00fc,  consequently  to  be identified w ith  the   \u00b5  recorded by Strabo 12.8.10,  11  (Akurgal  ( 1976a)  259  and  map  5).  Preserving  its ancient  name  in  Byzantine  sources,  ancient  Greek Daskyleion  was  easily  identified w ith  modern  (Turkish)  Eskel Limani,  on  a  peninsula  jutting  into  the  Sea  of  Marmara.  This was  presumably  the  harbour,  while  the  main  site  has  been found  in  the  area  of  the  village  Esence  (former  Eskel  or  Eskel k\u00f6y)  lying  c. 2  km  inland  (Corsten  ( 1988)  54\u00ad57  with  figs. 1\u00ad3). The  site  was  not  excavated,  but  the  field surveys y ielded ceramics  of  C 4  as  the  earliest  material  (Bittel  ( 1953)  6),  and some  late  inscriptions  have  been  found  by  chance  (Corsten ( 1988)  72\u00ad77  nos. 1\u00ad6,(1990)  43\u00ad46  nos. 7\u00ad10). In  spite  of  the  lack  of  positive  evidence,  one  may  suppose that  Daskyleion  was  colonised  by  Miletos  (no. 854). According  to  Nikolaos  of  Damaskos  (FGrHist 90)  fr. 63,a certain  Miletos,  probably  a  Milesian,  was  married  into  the Lydian  royal  family  but  went  into  exile  and  came  first t o Daskyleion,  later  to  Prokonnesos.  If  we  can  trust  these  late sources,  Daskyleion  was  a  Milesian  foundation  (Ehrhardt ( 1988)  47;Corsten ( 1988)  63\u00ad64). 978 avram Daskyleion  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.

Didymon  Teichos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.

The  external  and  collective  use  of the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists. Paisos  has  tentatively  been  located  at  Fanous  (Turkish name  Fanar  on  R.  Kiepert's  map),  c. 12  km  east-north-east  of Lampsakos  (no. 748),  at  the  extreme  north  point  of  the coast,  c. 30  km  west  of  Parion  (no. 756)  (Leaf  ( 1923)  99\u00ad100 and  photo  pl.  V  A;  Ruge  ( 1939)  559,(1942b)  2435;  Frisch ( 1978)  105  n. 4).  The  river  Paisos  could  be  modern  Bairam \u00c7ayi  (Karanly  Dere  on  Kiepert's  map:  Ruge  ( 1939)  559).  The relationship  with  Homer's  (Il. 2.828,  5.612)  remains obscure  (Strabo  13.1.10,  19;  Steph.  Byz. 102.16;  Eust.  Il. i 558.8\u00ad9). Paisos  was  colonised  by  Miletos  (no. 854)  (Anaximenes  of Lampsakos  (FGrHist 72)  fr. 26),  presumably  in  C 7  like  the other  Milesian  colonies  in  the  Propontis.  In  499  Paisos 990 avram joined  the  Ionian  cities  in  their  revolt  against  Persia  and  was subjected  by  Daurises  in  498  or 497  (Hdt. 5.117).The  city  was a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists from  453/2  (IG i\u00b3  260.viii.5)  to  430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.iii.28)  a  total of  twelve  times,  once  completely  restored,  paying  in  all  years a  phoros  of 1,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  260.viii.5).  It was  presumably assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.90). According  to  Strabo,  Paisos  was  destroyed  and  the  cit- izens  moved  to  Lampsakos  (Strabo  13.1.19: .     \u00b5  \u00b5).  The destruction  of  Paisos  can  be  dated  to  the  period  c. 425\u00ad350:in the  tribute  lists  Paisos  is  not  recorded  later  than  430/29  and is  missing  from  the  full  (?)  list  of 429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282).  But  so  is Priapos  (no. 758),  and  if  the  [ ]  are  correctly restored  in  IG i\u00b3  71.iii.5,  the  terminus  post  quem  must  be 425/4.  The  fact  that  Paisos  is  not  mentioned  between  Parion and  Lampsakos  in  the  list  of  Hellespontine  poleis  in  Ps.- Skylax 94  indicates  a  terminus  ante  quem  of  C 4m.Leaf  ( 1923) 100  suggests  that  Paisos  fell  to  Lampsakos  after  the  competi- tion  between  Parion  and  Lampsakos  reported  in  Polyaen. 6.24  (rC 4). 756.

The  city-ethnic  is  ,  attested in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  in  its  collective  and  external  use (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.27).  Astakos  is  not  attested  as  a  polis  in  sources of  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods,  but  deserves  inclusion as  a  polis  type  B  since  ( 1)  it  had  a  mint  (infra);  ( 2)  it  was  a member  of  the  Delian  League  (infra);  and  ( 3)  it  is  retrospec- tively  classified as a polis  in  later  sources  (Diod. 19.60.3 (r 315);  Polyaen. 2.30.3  (r 363\u00ad352)). The  ancient  site  must  have  been  somewhere  on  the  south coast  of  the  Gulf  of  I . zmit  called      (Strabo  10.2.21,  12.4.2;  Steph.  Byz. 238.17)  or   '  (Ps.-Skylax  92;Pompon.  1.100).  Astakos  may have  been  situated  near  modern  Yuvacik  (Ruge  ( 1896)  1774), but  a  location  closer  to  the  sea,  at  \"Ba \u017es  Iskele,  dans  la  zone  du port  militaire  de  G\u00f6lc\u00fck\",  seems  more  likely,  since  this  site produced  some  Archaic  (?)  and  Classical  pottery  (BE  ( 1974) 574  summarising  S \u017eahin  ( 1974)  66\u00ad83).  The  territory of Astakos  is  described  by  Polyaen. 2.30.3  as  a  marshy   inhabited  by  (perhaps  Bithynian  \"helots\":  Burstein ( 1976)  130  n. 64).  A  (Arr.  (FGrHist 156)  fr. 18  Plin.  HN 5.148:  Megarice oppidum)  tentatively located  by  R.  Kiepert  at  Cape  \u00c7atal  Burun  (Ruge  ( 1931)) clearly  indicates  colonisation  by  Megara  (no. 225). According  to Charon  of  Lampsakos  (FGrHist 262  fr. 6), Astakos  was  founded  by  the  Kalchedonians  (no. 743).  But other  sources  mention  Megara  (no. 225)  as  the  metropolis (Strabo  12.4.2;Pompon.  1.100;  Memnon  (FGrHist 434)  fr. 12 ( 20),  whose  source  was  Nymphis  of  Herakleia  (C 4\u00adC3);  cf. Toepffer  ( 1896)  126).Both  Memnon  and  Strabo  mention  the later  Athenian  colony  (infra)  and  local  Bithynian  settlers  as well.  Combining  the  sources,  we  may  infer  that  Astakos  was founded  by Kalchedonians  (Merkelbach  ( 1980)  91)  but  pos- sibly  reinforced  by  Megarians,  since  a   is  attested  in  the  territory  of  Astakos  (Hanell ( 1934)  120;  Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  51,  53).  The  foundation  year of 712/11,given  by  Memnon  ((FGrHist 434)  fr. 12  ( 20))  and  by Euseb.  Chron. 91,  Helm,  is  too  early,  since  Kalchedon  itself was  founded  about  685.  Scholars  generally  assume  a  date  in C 7  (Hanell  ( 1934)  120;  Merkelbach  ( 1980)  91).  According  to Memnon,  the  oecist  was  Astakos,  a  descendant  of  the Spartans  from  Thebes,  while  for  Arrian  (FGrHist 156  fr. 26) Astakos  was  son  of  Poseidon  and  the  nymph  Olbia  (cf. Asheri  ( 1978)). Astakos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  is  record- ed  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.27)  to  444/3  (IG i\u00b3  268.i.33,almost completely  restored)  a  total  of  five times,  paying  a  tribute  of 3,000  dr.  in  454/3\u00ad453/2  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.27,  260.viii.18), reduced to 1,000  dr.  in  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.16).  It  is  absent from  the  full  panel  of 442/1  (IG i\u00b3  270.i.35\u00adii.30).  Accepting Niese's  attractive  emendation  of  Diod. 12.3.5  ( for MSS ),  we  can  infer  that  the  Athenians  in  435/4 placed  a  colony  at  Astakos  (Meiggs  ( 1972)  198;  Schuller ( 1974)  30\u00ad31,  155;  cf.  Strabo  12.4.2  and  Memnon  (FGrHist 434)  fr. 12  ( 20)).  Astakos  was  unsuccessfully  besieged c. 363\u00ad352  by  Klearchos,  the  tyrant  of  Herakleia  Pontike  (no. 715)  (Polyaen. 2.30.3;  cf.  Burstein  ( 1976)  55\u00ad56),  and  in  315  by the  propontic  coast  of  asia  minor  977 Zipoites  (Diod. 19.60.3).  Both  references  to  sieges  show  that the  city  was  fortified.  In  281,  however,  Astakos  was  destroyed and  replaced  by  Nikomedia,  settled  inter  alios  with  the inhabitants  of  Astakos  (Strabo  12.4.2;  Paus. 5.12.7).

Ruge  ( 1937);  Jacoby, FGrHist ii  D  pp. 565\u00ad66).Olbia  is  identified w ith  Nikomedia by  Steph.  Byz. 475.15\u00ad16,followed  by Tscherikower  ( 1927)  46; Hanell  ( 1934)  121;  Marek  ( 1993)  15.  Both  identifications, however,  are  contradicted  by Ptol.  Geog. 5.1.2,  which  lists Astakos,  Olbia  and  Nikomedia  side  by  side.  The  preferable view  seems  to  be  that  Olbia  was  a  settlement  in  the  territory of  first A stakos,  later  Nikomedia.  Whatever  the  position  of Olbia,  the  settlement  had  some  importance,  as  the  Gulf  of Astakos  was  also  called  '  (Ps.-Skylax  92;Pompon. 1.100). Nothing  is  known  about  the  history  of  the  city.  Olbia seems  at  an  early  date  to  have  been  incorporated  into,  prob- ably,  Astakos.  In spite  of  the  lack  of  evidence,  Olbia  might have  been  founded  by  Megara  (no. 225),  since  the  whole neighbouring  region  belonged  to  the  area  of  Megarian colonisation. 754.

The collective  and  internal  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  on coins  (infra).  The  external  use  is  attested  in  the  Athenian tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  260.x.4)  and  in  Xen.

For  the individual  and  external  use,  see  the  C 5m  Athenian  proxeny decree  for  one  or  more  citizens  of  Parion  (IG i\u00b3  18)  and  the C 4m  sepulchral  monument  (IG ii\u00b2  10045  (C 4m)). Parion  is  located  at  modern  Kemer  (Turkish  name),  north- east  of  the  mouth  of  the  river  Kemer  Dere.  Here  some  ancient remains  were  found  in  1801  by  P.  Hunt  and  J.  D.  Carlyle (Walpole  ( 1818)  87\u00ad88;Ewers ( 1822)  427\u00ad30),  in  1835  by Texier (( 1862)  174),  and  in  1978  marble  blocks  including  uninscribed stelae  were  found  on  the  acropolis  (Frisch  ( 1983)  54). Since  Asia  Minor  was  never  clearly  subdivided  into  polit- ical  and/or  geographical  regions,  Parion  is  variously  placed in  Phrygia  (Ps.-Skylax  94),  in  the  Troas  (Strabo  13.1.4,  quot- ing  Eudoxos  of  Kyzikos,  Damastes  of  Sigeion  and  Charon  of Lampsakos),  in  Mysia  (Ptol.  Geog. 5.2.2),  in  the  Propontis (Strabo  10.5.7;  Eust.  Comm.  Dionys.  Per. 517),  in  the Hellespont  (Hdt. 4.138.1;  Steph.  Byz. 505.13)  and  in  the Hellespont  or  the  Propontis  (Strabo  7  fr. 58). The  territory  of  Parion  was  called  (Anaximenes (FGrHist 72)  fr. 25).It  was  bordered  to  the  west  by  Paisos  (no. 755)  but  after  the  integration  of  this  city  into  Lampsakos (no. 748)  in  C 5l\u00adC4m  Parion  and  Lampsakos  became  neigh- bours,  with  the  frontier  between  the  two  cities  at  `\u00b5, 70  stades  from  Parion  and  200  stades  from  Lampsakos (Polyaen. 6.24;see supra 976).  To  the  east  Parion  bordered on  Priapos  (no. 758). According  to  Euseb.  Chron. 91b,  Helm,  Parion  was  found- ed  in  709;  cf.  Ath. 116A\u00adD.  The  sources  disagree  about  the metropolis:  Erythrai  (no. 845)  and  \"Ionia\"  (Paus. 9.27.1); Thasos  (no. 526)  (Eust.  Comm.  Dionys.  Per. 517);  Paros  (no. 509)  (Strabo  10.5.7);  Miletos  (no. 854),  Erythrai  and  Paros (Strabo  13.1.14).  Since  the  toponym  Parion  is  obviously derived  from  Paros,  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  Paros  was  the main  coloniser  (Frisch  ( 1983)  60),  while  the  version  con- cerning  Thasos  may  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  Thasos  was a  foundation  of  Paros;  but  in  that  case  the  foundation  year 709  must  be  lowered,  because  Thasos  itself  was  founded c. 710\u00ad680  (Pouilloux  ( 1954)  24;  Frisch  ( 1983)  59).  Erythraian participation  is  supported  by  the  officials called   (I.Parion 1.22)  attested  also  in  Erythrai  (I.Erythrai 201c.46), but  not  at  Miletos  and  Paros  (Bilabel  ( 1920)  49;  Frisch  ( 1983) 59).  Ehrhardt  ( 1988)  36  also  adduces  the  name  Damalis  as  an onomastic  link  between  the  two  cities.  Strabo's  error  about the  foundation  of  Lampsakos  discredits  his  information about  Parion.  For  an  attempt  to  harmonise  all  these  tradi- tions,  see  Burn  ( 1935)  132  with  n. 7. Parion  must  have come  under  Persian  domination  after 547,  and  in  reference  to c. 514/13  Herophantos  of  Parion  is mentioned  among  the  Hellespontine  tyrants  by  Hdt. 4.138.1. Parion  took  part  in  the  Ionian  Revolt  (Hdt. 5.103),  but  by chance  it  escaped  being  conquered  by  Daurises  in  497  (Hdt. 5.117.1).Parion  joined  the  Delian  League,  perhaps  in  478/7.It belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  in  the tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.vi.15)  to  418/17  (IG i\u00b3 287.ii.15)  a  total  of  fourteen  times,  twice  completely restored,  paying  a  phoros  of  first  1  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  259.vi.15), reduced to 2,000  dr.  in,  probably, 443/2  (IG i\u00b3  269.ii.19),  but raised  again  to  1  tal.  in  435/4  (IG i\u00b3  277.v.4).  It was  presum- ably  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.71).  During  the Peloponnesian  War  Parion  supported  Athens  (ATL;Xen. the  propontic  coast  of  asia  minor  991 Hell. 1.1.13).  The  Attic  proxeny  decree  for  Phanokritos  of Parion,  who  revealed  the  plans  of  the  Spartan  fleet t o  the Athenians  ( 387/6),  suggests  that  Parion  continued  to  be  an ally  of  Athens  during  the  Corinthian  War  (IG ii\u00b2 3822  Syll. \u00b3137).  Parian  envoys  to  the  Odrysian  king Medokos  are  mentioned  by  Xen.  An. 7.3.16  (r 400).  By  the King's  Peace  of 387/6  Parion  fell  to  Persia,  and  c. 360  it  was besieged  and  conquered  by  Iphiades  of  Abydos  (Aen.  Tact. 28.6\u00ad7). City walls  ( ) and their gates () are attested by Aen.  Tact. 28.6\u00ad7  in  his  account  of  the  conquest  of  Parion  by Iphiades  of  Abydos  (c. 360).  In  1801  the  walls  of  Parion  still stood,  and  were  built  of  large  blocks  of  squared  marble without  mortar  (Hunt  and  Carlyle  quoted  by  Frisch  ( 1983) 54).  The  existence  of  a  harbour  is  implicitly  suggested  by Xen.  Hell. 1.1.13  (r 410)  and  explicitly  mentioned  by  Strabo 13.1.14.  There  is  no  evidence  about  public  architecture  in Parion  with  the  exception  of  an  extra-urban  oracular  sanc- tuary  ( \u00b5) of  Apollo  Aktaios  and  Artemis  at Adrasteia.  Possibly  in  C 4  it  was  demolished,  and  the  marble was  reused  for  the  altar  of  Apollo  Aktaios  at  Parion,  a  work of  Hermokreon  (Strabo  13.1.13;  cf. 10.5.7  and  bronze  coins  of c. 350\u00ad300,  infra);  cf.  Leaf  ( 1923)  84\u00ad85;  L.  Robert  ( 1966) 43\u00ad44. The  most  important  god  of  the  city  was  Apollo  Aktaios, whose  position  as  the  protective  deity  of  Parion  is  later attested  by  a  silver  tetradrachm  of  c. 150  bearing  the  legend   ;  cf.  Seyrig ( 1958)  611\u00ad12;  L.  Robert  ( 1966)  43;  Price  and  Trell  ( 1977)  121. Of  other  communal  cults  attested  in  later  sources,  there  is evidence  for  pre-Hellenistic  worship  of  Eros  (Paus. 9.27.1), because  his  statue  was  made  by  Praxiteles  (Plin.  HN 36.22) before  354  (Wolters  ( 1913);  Mirone  ( 1921);  L.  Robert  ( 1966) 43\u00ad44;  Bonacasa  ( 1976)),  and  for  Priapos,  of  Lampsakene origin  and  very  popular  in  the  whole  region  (Robert  and Robert ( 1950)  80\u00ad93),  who  acquired  a  local  epiklesis  in Parion  (Hsch.  s.v. .      ). Parion  struck  electrum  coins  of  the  Gorgoneion  type from  C 5e  (Head,  HN \u00b2  531;Babelon ( 1950)  42,with  a  too  early date).  In  C 5e  the  city  also  started  to  strike  silver  coins.  Types: obv.  Gorgoneion;  rev.  incuse  square  containing  a  cruciform pattern:  e.g.  BMC  Mysia  pl. 21.6,  dated  to  c. 500\u00ad475  (Price and  Waggoner  ( 1975)  84;  SNG  Cop.  Mysia 256).  C. 350\u00ad300 (Le  Rider  ( 1963)  53\u00ad55)  Parion  struck  silver  hemidrachms  on the  Persian  standard.  Types:  obv.  bull  looking  back,  with  var- ious  symbols;  legend:  ;  rev.  Gorgoneion  (SNG  Cop. Mysia 257\u00ad67).  A  series  of  bronze  coins  may  be  dated  to c. 350\u00ad300  or  later.  Types:  obv.  bull;  rev.  the  great  altar  of Parion  built  by  Hermokreon  (supra)  (Head,  HN \u00b2  531;  SNG Cop.  Mysia 270\u00ad71). 757. ", "Metropolis": "Identifier: 750. , Map 52.

Plakia  is  placed  in  Phrygia  by  Ps.-Skylax  94,  in  the Hellespontine  region  by  Steph.  Byz. 525.14.  Describing  the coast  from  west  to  east,  Pompon. 1.98  and  Plin.  HN 5.142 mention  Plakia  as  an  oppidum  after  Kyzikos  (no. 747)  and before  the  river  Rhyndakos,  and  they  also  write  that  the  Mt. Olympos  was  behind  it  (a  tergo).  Consequently,  Plakia  has tentatively  been  located  at  Kur \u017esunlu  (Turkish  name),  halfway between  the  isthmus  of  Kyzikos  and  the  mouth  of  the  river Rhyndakos  (Philippson  ( 1913)  map  3;  Schmidt  ( 1950)). Plakia  is  described  by  Herodotos  as  a  semi-barbarian community  in  which  Pelasgians  lived  side  by  side  with Athenians  ( 1.57.2)  (cf.  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 1.29).  In  Ps.- Skylax 94  Plakia  is  listed  under  the  heading   ` .Herodotos'account implies that Plakia,in so  far  as  it  was  a  Hellenic  community,  was  an  Athenian  foun- dation.  Plakia  may  have  been  incorporated  into  Kyzikos,  the end  of  the  local  coinage  being  a  terminus  post  quem.

There  is  no  reference  to  Miletouteichos  as a  polis  in  any  source,  but  polis  status  in  the  Classical  period  is indicated  by  membership  of  the  Delian  League  and  the attestation  in  C 4s  of  a  theorodokos. Miletouteichos  was  completely  unknown  until  the  dis- covery  first of  the  Hell.  Oxy.  and  then  of  the  C 4s  list  of  Argive theorodokoi  (SEG 23  189).  In  Hell.  Oxy. 25.3,  Chambers,  we learn  that  Agesilaos  in  395  on  his  march  from  Kios  (no. 745) to  Phrygia  attacked  a  place  called  Miletou  Teichos,  but  failed to  take  it  and  then  marched  along  the  river  Rhyndakos  to Daskyleion  (no. 740).  In  the  Argive  theorodokoi  list  of  c. 330 Miletouteichos  is  listed  after  Kios  and  Brylleion  (  Myrleia) and  before  Iasos  (SEG 23  189.ii.16).  These  two  sources  are still  the  only  ones  we  have,  but  a  third  can  be  added  if,  in  the Athenian  assessment  decree  of 410/9  (IG i\u00b3  100.iii.5),  we accept  the  restoration  [] instead of [] in the editio princeps:  Hesperia 5  ( 1936) 387  (see  Schwertheim  ( 1983)  107). The  relationship  between  the  two  toponyms Miletoupolis  and  Miletouteichos  is  a  moot  point.  Some scholars  have  assumed  identity  between  Miletouteichos  and Miletoupolis  (Charneux  ( 1966)  217\u00ad18;  Ehrhardt  ( 1988)  43; Debord  ( 1999)  250).  That  the  two  toponyms  denote  differ- ent  sites  has  been  argued  forcefully  by  Schwertheim  ( 1983) 95\u00ad99,  followed  by Barr.,  Map  52.  Miletouteichos  should  be placed  north-west  of  Lake  Apolloniatis,  according  to  Barr.at modern  Uluabat,  a  location  which  fits the description of Agesilaos'  march  route  in  Hell.  Oxy.  Schwertheim  ( 1983) 98\u00ad99  prefers  to identify  Miletouteichos  with  the  later Apollonia  on  the  Rhyndakos modern  G\u00f6lyazi. A  possible  reconstruction  of  our  sources  is  that,  after Alkibiades'  naval  victory  at  Kyzikos  in  410,  Miletouteichos was  founded  as  an  Athenian  colony  and  incorporated  into the  Delian  League  (Meiggs  ( 1972)  369,  438\u00ad39;  Schwertheim ( 1983)  107;  Ehrhardt  ( 1988)  43).  It was  probably  an  Athenian settlement  and,  at  first,  independent  of  the  neighbouring poleis.  In  C 4,  on  the  other  hand,  the  fortified settlement may have  become  a  dependency  of  neighbouring  Miletoupolis (no. 750);  and  the  Athenian  influence on M iletoupolis' coinage  and  calender  indicates  a  fusion  of  the  population  of the  two  settlements.  Since  the  appointment  of  a  theorodokos was  an  act  of  a  polis  rather  than  of  a  fortress  (Perlman  ( 2000) 45\u00ad60),the  presence  of  a  theorodokos  in  Miletouteichos  c. 330 indicates  that  Miletouteichos  was  a  (dependent)  polis  and not  just  a  fortress  lying  in  the  territory  of  Miletoupolis.  For the  polis  status  of  a  teichos,  cf.  e.g.  Neon  Teichos  (no. 824), one  of  the  eleven  Aiolian  poleis  (Hdt. 1.149.1,  150.2). 752.  Myrleia  (Myrleanos) Map  52.

The  correspon- ding  city-ethnics  are  (IG i\u00b3  280.ii.18)  and (on  coins,  infra).  Both  Brylleion  (SEG 23 189.ii.15)  and  Myrleia  (Strabo  12.4.3)  are  attested  as  neigh- bours  of  Kios  (no. 745).  Stephanos  ( 187.13\u00ad14)  quotes  Ephor. fr. 45  for  the  view  that  Brylleion  is  identical  with  Kios:       \u017d     .  The  error disappears  if  one  for  reads :\"Ephoros says that it (Brylleion)  belongs  to  Kios\";  that  Brylleion/Myrleia  in  C 4 was  a  dependency  of  Kios  is  stated  at  Diod. 20.111.4,if  one accepts  Post's  conjecture  for (see Corsten ( 1987)  8  with  n. 4).  The  identification of  Brylleion and  Myrleia  as  successive  names  of  the  same  settlement  is based  on  two  observations:  ( 1)  all  references  to  Brylleion concern  C 5\u00adC4,  whereas  attestations  of  Myrleia  belong  in C 4s\u00adC2;(2)  both  names  are  variants  of  the  same  (barbar- ian?)  toponym:  change  of into  \u00b5,  and  metathesis &gt;  (Corsten  ( 1987)  4\u00ad6).  Since  the  first c oins,  of  C 4s,  have  the legend ,  Corsten  assumes  that  Myrleia  became  the the  propontic  coast  of  asia  minor  989 official name shortly after c. 330.In 202  Myrleia  was destroyed  by Philip  V  of  Makedonia  and  refounded  as Apameia  (Strabo  12.4.3). In  Ps.-Skylax 94  Myrleia  is  the  first t oponym  listed  after the  heading   `   where polis  is  used  in the  urban  sense.  That  Myrleia  was  a  polis  in  the  political sense  too  is  strongly  indicated  by  its  coinage  and  its  mem- bership  of  the  Delian  League.  The  collective  and  internal  use of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  on  the  coins  (infra),  the  external use  is  attested  in  an  Attic  decree  of 304/3  (IG ii\u00b2  703.10).  For the  individual  and  external  use,  see  the  numerous  references to (C 3\u00adC2)  (Ath. 50D). Myrleia  is  located  at  Mudanya  (Turkish  name),  c. 20  km west  of  Kios  (for  some  earlier  descriptions,  see  Texier  ( 1862) 113\u00ad15;  Perrot  ( 1872)  12\u00ad14).  According  to  Ps.-Skylax  94, Myrleia  belonged  to  Phrygia;  later  it  was  part  of  Bithynia. Myrleia  was  colonised  by  Kolophon  (no. 848).  The  testi- monies  are  late  but  leave  no  doubt:  Pompon. 1.99;  Plin.  HN 5.143;  Steph.  Byz. 463.18.  The  foundation  year  is  not  attested. Brylleion  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists from  433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.18)  to  418/17  (IG i\u00b3  287.ii.23)  a  total  of four  times,  paying  a  phoros  of 3,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.18).  It  is absent  from  the  full  panel  of 442/1  (IG i\u00b3  270.i.35\u00adii.30). From 337  to 302  both  Kios  and  Myrleia  were  ruled  by Mithridates  II  (Diod. 20.111.4,  as  emended  by Post).  From C 4l  to  C 3  Myrleia  (Bryllion)  belonged  for  a  short  time  to  the of  the  sanctuary  of  Athena  Ilias  (L.  Robert  ( 1966) 31\u00ad33,  39).  C. 330  a  theorodokos  was  appointed  to  host  theoroi from  Argos  (no. 347)  (SEG 23  189.ii.15). The  first c oins  were  minted  at  a  time  when  the  official name  of  the  city  was  Myrleia,  i.e.  C 4\u00adC3.  Reinach  ( 1908) 247\u00ad49  distinguished  twenty-seven  types:  obv.  heads  of  dif- ferent  gods,  also  wheel,  humped  bull,  horseman,  lyre,  corn wreath,  etc.;  rev.  legend: ,  or ,  sometimes  with  monograms  (names  of  magis- trates?);  cf.

Anab. 1.12.6  (r 334) Kolonai  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense.  Strabo  locates Kolonai  in  the  territory  of  Lampsakos  (no. 748)  and  consid- ers  it  to  be  a  Milesian  colony  founded  inland.  The  settlement has  been  hypothetically  located  at  \u00c7ataltepe,  c. 18  km  east- south-east  of  Lampsakos  or,  alternatively,  at  Arabakanagi, more  towards  the  south-east  (B\u00fcrchner  ( 1921);  Leaf  ( 1923) 101\u00ad2;  Frisch  ( 1978)  106  n. 6)  and  is  to  be  distinguished  from Kolonai  at  Alexandria  Troas,  on  the  coast  (Cook  ( 1973) 216\u00ad21).  Strabo  is  probably  wrong  about  Miletos  (no. 854)  as the  metropolis  of  Kolonai,  and  it  seems  preferable  to assume foundation  by  Lampsakos  (Ehrhardt  ( 1988)  35\u00ad36)  followed by  a  later  reintegration  into  the  metropolis  (Jones  ( 1971)  86).

The  city-ethnic  is   (IG i\u00b3  1508.4  (C 6m)  from  Sigeion;  I.Lampsakos 26.2  (C 4)). Prokonnesos  is  attested  as  a  polis  both  in  the  political  sense (Hdt. 4.15.1)  and  in  the  urban  sense  (Hdt. 4.14.2;  Ps.-Skylax 94,  where    is  listed  under  the  heading  ` ).  For  the  political  sense,  see  also Hdt. 4.138.1:    in  a  list  of tyrants  with  the  heading     ( 4.137.2).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  internally  on  the  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  a  ref- erence  to  the  Prokonnesioi  as  Athenian  allies  (Dem. 50.6). For  the  individual  and  external  use,  see  the  Ionian\u00adAttic monument  from  Sigeion  (IG i\u00b3  1508.4  (C 6m))  and  the Prokonnesian  attested  in  the  Karthaian  list  of  proxenoi  (IG xii.5542.57  (C 4m)). The  city  is  located  on  Marmara  island  (Mermeradasi  in Turkish),  north-west  of  the  Kyzikene  peninsula.  Strabo 13.1.16  makes  a  distinction  between  ancient  Prokonnesos (which  could  be  the  island  of  Halone,  in  front  of  Kyzikos: Frisch  ( 1983)  50)  and  contemporary  Prokonnesos.  The ancient  urban  centre  (not  recorded  in  Barr.)  was  in  the south-west  part  of  the  island  (Danoff  ( 1974)  560). The  territory  of  Prokonnesos  comprised  the  whole  island (Gedeon  ( 1895);  Hasluck  ( 1909)  9\u00ad13;  Danoff  ( 1974)  560; L.  Robert  ( 1978)  327\u00ad28)  and  was  famous  for  its  marble (Strabo  7  fr. 55,  13.1.16).  The  remains  of  the  quarries-- described  by  Texier  ( 1862)  161\u00ad62,  Hasluck  ( 1909)  11\u00ad13  and Holbach  ( 1909)--are now meticulously r esearched  by  N. Asgari (Mitchell  ( 1990)  88\u00ad89,(1999)  129\u00ad30).  In  C 4f Prokonnesos  controlled  a  neighbouring  island  called Elaphonnesos  (Ps.-Skylax  94).  According  to later  authors, Elaphonnesos  and  Prokonnesos  were  the  same  island (Danoff  ( 1974)  560). Prokonnesos  was  founded  by  the  Milesians  (no. 854)  con- temporaneously  with  Priapos  (no. 758)  and  Abydos  (no. 765)  (Strabo  13.1.12).  For  various  etymologies  of  the toponym,  see  schol.  Ap.  Rhod. 2.279.  Prokonnesos  may indeed  belong  to  the  first stage of  Milesian  colonisation  of the  Propontis  together  with  Abydos  and  Priapos,  both founded  c. 670  (Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  46,  48;  Ehrhardt  ( 1988) 38  suggests  a  date  close  to  that  of  Kyzikos'  foundation,  C 7e). Under  Persian  control  after  547,  Prokonnesos  was  in  c. 513 ruled  by  Metrodoros,  recorded  among  the  Hellespontine tyrants  at  Hdt. 4.138.1.The  city  took  part  in  the  Ionian  Revolt and  was  burnt  by  the  Phoinikian  fleet in  493  (Hdt. 6.33.2).At an  unknown  date  it  joined  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists from  452/1  (IG i\u00b3  261.iv.17)  to  418/17  (IG i\u00b3  287.ii.14)  a  total  of fourteen  times,  paying  in  all  years  a  phoros  of 3  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 271.i.33).  It  was  perhaps  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3 the  propontic  coast  of  asia  minor  993 71.iii.103,completely  restored).  Prokonnesos  remained  loyal to  Athens  during  the  Peloponnesian  War,  and  in  410 Alkibiades  used  its  harbour  as  his  base  for  the  operations leading  to  the  battle  of  Kyzikos  (Xen.  Hell. 1.1.13,  18\u00ad20). Persian  domination  after  the  King's  Peace  in  387/6  is  to be assumed,  but  in  362  the  Prokonnesians  are  once  again  attest- ed  as  allied  with  Athens  (Dem. 50.5).  After  a  war  with Kyzikos  (no. 747)  in  362/1,  Prokonnesos  was  conquered,  and some  citizens  were  moved  to  Kyzikos  (Dem. 50.5;  Paus. 8.46.4;  cf.  Moggi,  Sin. 341\u00ad44),  but  Prokonnesos  was  not destroyed  (L.  Robert  ( 1967)  17\u00ad18),  and  in  340  it  appears  as an  ally  of  Athens  in  the  war  against  Philip  of  Makedonia (Dem. 18.302).  Also  ,  i.e.  citizens  of Prokonnesos,  are  attested  in  the  Hellenistic  period  (SEG 30 551.3,  34  604  (C 3);  see  L.  Robert  ( 1967)  19\u00ad21).  Prokonnesos was  probably  allowed  to persist  as  a  dependency  of  Kyzikos, i.e.  as  a  dependent  polis.  A  citizen  of  Prokonnesos  was appointed  proxenos  by  Karthaia  (no. 492)  in  C 4m  (IG xii.5 542.57). Some  names  derived  from  Apollo  may  suggest  that  the patron  deity  was  Apollo,  as  in  other  Milesian  colonies (Ehrhardt  ( 1988)  40).  The  cult  of  Kybele  is  attested  by  Paus. 8.46.4:  having  conquered  Prokonnesos,  the  Kyzikenes moved  the  cult  statue  ( \u00b5) of  Mother  Dindymene  (i.e. Kybele)  from  Prokonnesos  to  Kyzikos. The  coinage  of  Prokonnesos  (Head,  HN \u00b2  537\u00ad38)  has been  redated  by  Thompson  ( 1965)  and  subdivided  into  four series.  ( 1)  C. 450\u00ad425,denomination:  silver  hemiobols  on  the Persian  standard.  Types:  obv.  forepart  of  a  horse;  rev. oinochoe  within  an  incuse  square.  ( 2)  C. 411\u00ad387/6,  denomi- nation:  silver  hemidrachms  on  the  Persian  standard.  Types: obv.  different  types  of  female  head  to l.,  presumably Aphrodite;  rev.  oinochoe;  legend: .(3)\u00ad(4) After c. 387/6  on  the  Rhodian  standard.  ( 3)  Denominations: tetradrachms,  drachms  and  fractions;  small  fractions  in bronze.  Types:  obv.  female  head,  r.;  rev.  stag  or  stag's forepart (silver),  or  oinochoe,  or  dove;  legend: ,names of magistrates  except  on  smaller  bronze  coins. ( 4) Denominations:  hemidrachms,  trihemiobols  and  small bronzes  of  the  same  basic  types,  but  without  names  and  sub- sidiary  symbols.  The  date  of  the  last  coinage  is  given  by  the incorporation  of  Prokonnesos  into  Kyzikos  (SNG  Cop. Mysia 551\u00ad58). 760. ", "Kallipolis": "Identifier: 745. , (Kallipolites) Map  52.

The  settlement  was  pre- sumably  situated  between  Astakos  (no. 737)  and  Kios  (no. 745),but  the  exact  location  is  not  known  (Ruge  ( 1919b)).The scarce  evidence  suggests  that  at  an  early  date  it  was  integrat- ed  into  one  of  the  neighbouring  cities.  In  Ps.-Skylax  93  this Kallipolis  is  situated  in  Mysia  and  is  accordingly  different from  (a)  the  Kallipolis  situated  on  the  Chersonese  north  of Sestos  (no. 672)  (Ptol.  Geog. 3.11.9)  and  opposite  Lampsakos (no. 748)  (Strabo  13.1.18);  (b)  the  Kallipolis  situated  on  the Thracian  side  of  the  Bosporos  at  the  so-called  Anaplous (Steph.  Byz. 349.16).  All  three  cities  were  located  in  the the  propontic  coast  of  asia  minor  981 Hellespontine  district  of  the  Delian  League.  In  the  assess- ment  decree  of 425/4  and  in  some  of  the  tribute  lists  is recorded  a  community  called  .  As  the  evi- dence  stands,  it  is  impossible  to  decide  with  which  of  the three  cities  the  following  information  should  be  connected.

Priapos  is  located  at  mod- ern  Karabiga  (Turkish  name),  north-west  of  the  mouth  of the  river  Granikos modern  Kocaba \u017es  \u00c7ayi.  Lehmann- Haupt  ( 1918)  429\u00ad31  and  Leaf  ( 1923)  73\u00ad75  reported  some ancient  remains,  especially  traces  of  a  harbour  at  Kale Burun,  to  be  identified w ith  the  harbour  of  Priapos  men- tioned  at  Strabo  13.1.12  and 14.  Some  late  inscriptions  have been  found  by  chance:  Le  Bas  and  Waddington  ( 1870)  nos. 1750\u00ad51;  Legrand  ( 1893)  549\u00ad50  no. 45;  Lehmann-Haupt ( 1918)  430;  BE  ( 1972)  362  (to  add  some  of  the  monuments belonging  to  Priapos  but  included  in  the  Kyzikene  corpus  by Schwertheim  ( 1980):  nos. 337,  426,  444,  458;  cf.  BE  ( 1980) 395).  The  territory  was  originally  contiguous  with  the  territ- ories  of  Parion  (no. 756)  and  Lampsakos  (no. 748)  (Strabo 13.1.11)  to  the  west,  and  to  Kyzikos  (no. 747)  to  the  east (Strabo  12.4.6;  cf. 13.1.11). According  to  the  traditions  paraphrased  by  Strabo  13.1.12, Priapos  was  founded  either  by  the  Milesians  (no. 854)  con- temporaneously  with  Abydos  (no. 765)  and  Prokonnesos (no. 759),  or  by  Kyzikos  (no. 747).  The  synchronism  with Abydos  and  Prokonnesos  suggests  a  date  of  C 7e. Priapos  joined  the  Delian  League,  presumably  from  the beginning.  It  belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district  and  is recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.ii.13)  to 428/7  (IG i\u00b3  283.ii.17\u00ad18)  a  total  of  thirteen  times,  once  com- pletely  restored,  paying  in  all  years  a  phoros  of 500  dr.  (IG i\u00b3 266.i.18).  It was  presumably  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.97).  It  is  recorded  sometimes  by  toponym  (IG i\u00b3 266.i.18)  and  sometimes  by  city-ethnic  (IG i\u00b3  261.iv.11). Priapos  was  involved  in  some  war  operations  at  sea  in  411 (Thuc. 8.107.1).  It  fell  to  Persia  by  the  King's  Peace  of 386/7, and  in  334  it  willingly  opened  its  gates  to  Alexander  the  Great (Arr.  Anab. 1.12.7). The  city  is  called  after  its  patron  divinity  Priapos  (Strabo 13.1.12),  whose  cult  was  originally  limited  to  the  Propontis (Herter  ( 1954)  1914;  L.  Robert  ( 1979)  263\u00ad64),  and  Priapos constitutes  a  rare  case  of  the  toponym  being  identical  with, and  not  derived  from,  the  name  of  the  god  (Herter  ( 1954) 1915). 759.

For  the  collective and external  use  of  the  city-ethnic,  see  IG i\u00b3  261.i.14. Artake  was  located  on  the  island  of  Kyzikos  facing  Priapos (no. 758)  (Strabo  13.1.4),  near  Kyzikos  (no. 747)  (Hdt. 4.14.2) and  the  isthmos  (Ps.-Skylax  94),and  has  been  identified w ith modern  (Turkish)  Erdek  c. 7\u00ad8  km  west  of  Kyzikos.  The modern  toponym  derives  from  Greek  Artaki  (Hirschfeld ( 1895b)  1304).  For  descriptions  of  the  site,  see  Texier  ( 1862) 164\u00ad65;  Philippson  ( 1910)  52\u00ad53;  and  L.  Robert  ( 1955)  131\u00ad33, using  Radet's  survey  from  1887.  Of  the  few  archaeological remains,  the  most  important  is  an  Archaic  kouros (Laubscher  ( 1963\u00ad64)  73ff). Artake  was  colonised  by  Miletos  (no. 854)  (Anaximenes of  Lampsakos  (FGrHist 72)  fr. 26;  cf.  Steph.  Byz. 127.13;  schol. Ap.  Rhod. 1.955).  Artake  took  part  in  the  Ionian  Revolt  and was  burnt  by  the  Persians  in  493  (Hdt. 6.33.2).  Later  it  joined the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district and  is  recorded  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.vi.8)  to  418/17  (IG i\u00b3 287.ii.11)  a  total  of  sixteen  times,  twice  completely  restored, paying  a  tribute  of 2,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  261.i.14),  raised  to  4,000 dr.  in  418/17  (IG i\u00b3  287.ii.11).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.82).  Coinage  is  not  attested,  which  may suggest  a  rather  early  incorporation  of  Artake  into  Kyzikos, perhaps  simultaneously  with  Prokonnesos  (no. 759),  i.e.  in C 4  (Ehrhardt  ( 1988)  38  with  n. 244).Strabo  13.1.4  speaks  only of  a  mountain,  an  island  and,  in  another  context,  a  chorion, while  Plin.

Ol. 8.20  and  IG ii\u00b2  7965  (C 4m). Aigina  was  structurally  atypical  because  of  high  econom- ic  output  from  commerce  (Arist.  Pol. 1291b24).  It  had  two  or three  harbours  (cf.  Ps.-Skylax  53)  and  a  flourishing empori- on  (Dem. 23.211;Ephor.  fr. 176).  Demographic  indicators derive  from  fleet mobilisations.  During  the  C 5e  acme,  the total  population  was  35,000\u00ad45,000,  with 7,000\u00ad10,000 slaves/freedmen  and  1,500\u00ad2,500  males  of  or  above  hoplite rank  (Figueira  ( 1981)  22\u00ad52).This  level  was  attained  through assimilation  of  mainly  servile  immigrants.  In  spite  of  seri- ous  exaggeration,  Arist.  fr. 475.1  testifies t o  an  exceptionally high  number  of  slaves,  and  fr. 475.2  may  imply  a  high  num- ber  of  foreigners  (Figueira  ( 1991)  84\u00ad86,(1993)  206\u00ad8). Naturalisation  was  limited  or  protracted.  Even  an  euergetes, the  naukleros  Lampis  (C 4m),only  achieved  ateleia  as  a  metic (Dem. 23.211).  Refounded  Aigina  (C 4)  had  a  substantially lower  population.  Inscriptions  attest  to  foreigners  in  resid- ence  (e.g.  IG iv  50).  For  Aigina,  geographical  perceptions reinforced  cultural  affinities.  On  social  structure,  cf. Winterscheidt  ( 1938). For  Aiginetan  history,  see  the  chronological  table  in Figueira  ( 1993)  409\u00ad18  with  refs.;  also  Amit  ( 1973)  9\u00ad60.In C 8m\u00adC7l,  Aigina  had  sub-political  status  under  foreign hegemony.  Hegemony  by Argos  (no. 347)  was  mediated through  the  cult  league  of  Apollo  Pythaieus  (Hdt. 6.92.1\u00ad2; cf.  Pheidon's  apocryphal  minting:  Ephor.  fr. 115).Aigina  par- ticipated  in  the  Kalaurian  Amphiktyony  (Strabo  8.6.14).  In C 7l,  Aigina  was  controlled  by  Epidauros  (no. 348)  and became  independent  in  a  violent  secession  (Hdt. 5.83.1\u00ad2). actionGoTo:7,THE   actionGoTo:7,SARONIC   actionGoTo:7,GULF actionGoTo:7,thomas j. figueira Hellenistic  inscriptions  mention  a  pentapolis  that  might indicate  a  synoecism  (Felten  ( 1975)  42\u00ad52).  Subsequent Aiginetan  membership  in  the  Peloponnesian  League  is unlikely.  In  506,  the  \"Heraldless  War\"  began  with  the Athenians  (no. 361)  (Hdt. 5.80.2).Aigina  submitted  to  Persia before  Marathon  (Hdt. 6.49.1).  Effective  medising  was  pre- cluded  by  a  hostage  taking  by  Kleomenes  I  (Hdt. 6.73.2).  In the  early  480s,  stasis  flared in an A thenian-inspired  populist uprising  under  Nikodromos  (an  aristocratic  exile).  After brutal  suppression,  fugitives  became  Athenians,  later  assist- ing  against  Aigina  (Hdt. 6.88\u00ad91);  see  Gehrke,  Stasis 15\u00ad16.In 481,  the  Aiginetans  joined  the  Hellenic  League  (Hdt. 7.145.1; ML 27.3),  winning  the  aristeia  at  Salamis  (Hdt. 8.93.1). Remaining  aloof  from  the  Delian  League  until  457\u00ad456, Aigina  was  reduced  to  tributary  status  (Thuc. 1.108.4).  It belonged  to  the  Island  district  (IG i\u00b3  270.v.37)  and  is  regis- tered  in  the  tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.vi.18)  to  432/1 (IG i\u00b3  279.i.88)  a  total  of  ten  times,  twice  completely  restored, paying  a  phoros  of 30  tal.  in  all  years  except  450/49,  when  the payment  was  26  tal., 1,200  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.39,  ethnic restored),  and  432/1,  when  it  was  either  9  or 14  tal.  Returning fugitives  and  pro-Athenians  promoted  a  cult  of  Athena Polias  (IG iv  29\u00ad32).  Tributary  status  ended  with  an  expul- sion  in  431.Aiginetans  scattered,  fled t o  Kydonia  (no. 968),or were  harboured  in  the  Thyreatis  (as  a  Spartan  dependency: Thuc. 2.27.2);  some  assisted  Spartan  campaigning  ( 4.57.1\u00ad4). An Attic  apoikia,  in  which  a  remnant  population  was  supple- mented  by  reinforcing  settlers,  occupied  Aigina,  claiming  to represent  the  Aiginetan  polis  (Thuc. 2.27.1;  8.69.3);  the  5  per cent  import/export  tax  was  levied  there  (Ar.  Ran. 362\u00ad64, 380\u00ad81  with  schol.).  See  also  Figueira  ( 1991)  79\u00ad128. In 405,  Lysander  refounded  Aigina  (Xen.  Hell. 2.2.9). Under  Spartan  harmostai,  Aigina  fought  in  the  Corinthian War  (Hell. 5.1.1\u00ad24),  causing  damage  that  helped  motivate Athens  toward  the  King's  Peace  (Hell. 5.1.29).  When  fighting flared up in  378,the  Aiginetans  resumed  raiding  (Hell. 5.4.61, 6.2.1)  that  is  unclearly  demarcated  from  later  attacks ( 350\u00ad340s)  probably  taken  in  conjunction  with  Makedonia (Demades  fr. 67). Except  for  the  Attic  apoikia,  politics  was  dominated  by aristocratic  clans  or  phratries  (patrai),  celebrated  by  Pindar (Pyth. 8.38),  the  status  of  whose  members  (pakhees:  Hdt. 6.91.1;  dynatoi:  Paus. 3.4.2)  is  also  witnessed  by  chamber tombs  (see  Jeffery  ( 1974)).  An  Aristoteleian  politeia  is  attest- ed  (Arist.  fr. 475).  Two  outstanding  figures w ere  Krios,  who resisted  Kleomenes  (Hdt. 6.50.2\u00ad3),and  his  son  Polykritos,  a leader  at  Salamis  ( 8.92.1\u00ad2).  Aigina's  fleet was the predom- inant  military  instrument  (Thuc. 1.14.3),  supposedly  mak- ing  the  Aiginetans  thalassocrats  490\u00ad480  (Diod. 7  fr. 11).  An agreement  with  Athens  ( 450\u00ad446)  makes  security  arrange- ments  (IG i\u00b3  38).A  notable  C 4e  enactment  mandated  execu- tion  for  Athenians  taken  on  Aigina  (Diog.  Laert. 3.19 (r 390s)).Significant A iginetan  diplomacy  included  the  mes- sage  of  Polyarchos,  probably  a  Spartan  proxenos,  that  the walls  of  Athens  were  being  reconstructed  in  478  (Plut.  Them. 19.2)  and  covert  agitation  at  Sparta  (no. 345)  on  the  eve  of  the Peloponnesian  War  (Thuc. 1.67.2).  In  the  480s  and  later, Aigina  was  a  haven  for  Attic  ostracised  (Dem. 26.6;  Adespota Comica 3.40,  Kock).  Likely  Aiginetan  proxenoi  at  Athens were  Aristeides  and  Thoukydides  Melesiou.  A  proxenos  at Plataia  is  attested  (Hdt. 9.85.3).  For  a  possible  Aiginetan proxenos  for  Rhodos  at  Naukratis  (no. 1023),  see  Syll. \u00b3  110. The  epinicia  of  Pindar  and  the  status  of  Aiakos  as  a  judge of  souls  attest  to  the  quality  of  the  legal  system  (especially toward  xenoi).  The  Aegineticus  of  Isokrates  ( 19)  was  deliv- ered  in  an  Aiginetan  court  by  a  Siphnian  exile.  The  boule  and demos  are  attested  in  post-Classical  inscriptions  only  (e.g. IG iv  1.1).The  thearoi  were  a  prestigious  board,  whose  duties probably  transcended  cult  supervision  (schol.  Pind.  Nem. 3.122a\u00adb  with  Figueira  ( 1981)  314\u00ad21).  A  doubtful  civic eponymous  is  the  priest  of  Aphaia  used  to  date  Archaic  con- struction  at  the  sanctuary  (IG iv  1580).Tribes  and  demes  are attested  in  an  inscription  of 159\u00ad144  (IG iv  1.43\u00ad44). Additional  cults  (with  attested  festival:  *):  Athena,Aiakos*, Aiakidai,  Aphaia*,  Aphrodite*,  Apollo  Pythios/Delphinios*, Apollo  and  Poseidon,  Damia  and  Auxesia*,  Poseidon Hippourios*  and  Zeus  Hellanios*.  The  Hydrophoria  was  cel- ebrated  in  the  month  Delphinios  to  Apollo  Delphinios  as  oik- istes  (schol.  Pind.  Nem. 5.81a\u00adb).At  Salamis  the  Aiakidai  were ritually  summoned  (Hdt. 8.64.2,  83\u00ad84).  A  doubtful  Delphic consultation  by  the  Aiginetan  exiles  none  the  less  became proverbial  (CPG 1.22\u00ad23).  Gold  stars  were  dedicated  for  the aristeia  at  Salamis  (Hdt. 8.122).A  polyandrion,  commemorat- ing  casualties  at  Plataia,  was  dedicated  in  469  (Hdt. 9.85.3). Aiginetans  were  prominent  at  Delphi  after  the  Third  Sacred War  (Figueira  ( 1993)  356\u00ad58).IG  iv  39  and 1588  are  inventories of  dedications  inscribed  under  the  apoikia.  Aiginetans  are attested  as  victors  at  all  the  major  Panhellenic  games:  the Olympic  (Pind.  Ol. 8),  the  Pythian  (Pind.  Pyth. 8),  the Nemean  (Pind.  Nem. 3\u00ad8;Bacchyl.  12\u00ad13)  and  the  Isthmian (Pind.  Isthm. 5\u00ad6,  8\u00ad9).  Aiginetans  won  altogether  twenty- eight  attested  major  victories  (e.g.  SEG 39  255).  Note Praxidamas  Olympionikes  in 544,  victorious  in  the  Nemean and  Isthmian  Games  as  well,  and  the  first t o  have  his  statue  set up  at  Olympia  (Pind.

Pausanias  mentions  a  temple  of  Aphrodite, Aiakeion,  Phokeion,  kryptos  limen  and  its  mole,  theatre, stadion  (C 5\u00adC4  according  to  Krinzinger  ( 1968)),  temples  of Apollo,  Artemis  and  Dionysos,  Asklepieion,  a  temple  of Hekate,  and  extra-urban  sanctuaries  of  Aphaia  and Damia/Auxesia  ( 2.29.6\u00ad30.5).  The  acropolis  on  Cape Colonna  was  impressive  as  excavations  of  (e.g.)  the  C 6l Apollo  temple(s)  and  Thearion  have  confirmed (published in  the  series  Alt-\u00c4gina).  The  temenos  and  temple  of  Aphaia have had  a  long  history  of  excavation,  since  the  recovery of sculptures  by  the  Dilettanti  in  1811  (Ohly  ( 1976)  pp.  xi\u00adxiii; Bankel  ( 1993)).  The  Hellanion  on  Mt.  Oros  is  demonstrated by  excavation  to  have  been  another  important  sanctuary. The  military  harbour  with  its  ship  sheds  ( 480s)  was  a  \"state of  the  art\"  facility  (see  Knoblauch  ( 1972)).  Remains  have been  found  of  the  circuit  of  fortifications of  the  city,  extend- ed  in  C 5e  against  the  Attic  threat  (Welter  ( 1938a)  480\u00ad85). The  walls  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 52  ha  (Figueira  ( 1981)  39\u00ad40. Aigina  was  besieged  in  460/59  (Thuc. 1.105.2;Lys.  2.49),  and the  walls  demolished  in  457  (Thuc. 1.108.4).  Aigina  is  attest- ed  as  a  walled  city  in  389  (Xen.  Hell. 5.1.2;  cf.  Aen.  Tact. 20.5). The  mint  was  the  earliest  producer  of  silver  (from  560  to 540).  The  Aiginetan  standard  was  much  imitated.  Its  \"tur- tles\",  the  coins  par  excellence  of  the  Peloponnesos  (Poll. 9.74), minted  in  huge  numbers  and  with  high  purity,  were  widely disseminated,  dominating  circulation  in  several  regions (IGCH  ( 1974)  394;  Figueira  ( 1998)  36\u00ad41,  116\u00ad27).  Aiginetan money  was  critical  in  the  monetisation  of  the  Archaic  econ- omy.  In C 5m,the  obverse  design  became  a  tortoise,  while  the reverse  type  remained  a  conventional  incuse  square.  In  C 4, the  city-ethnic  in  abbreviation  (e.g. ) was affixed to the  reverse.  Denominations:  didrachm  stater,  drachm, triobol,  obol,  hemiobol  (C 6\u00ad456);  stater,  drachm,  triobol, obol,  hemiobol  (from  C 4e).  Bronze  coins  were  struck  in  C 4l or  C 3:  obv.  two  or  three  dolphins  circling  around  the  letter ;rev.incuse square divided into five  compartments,  some- times  with  legend  in  upper  compartments  (Head,  HN \u00b2 394\u00ad98;  SNG  Cop.  Attica-Aegina 501\u00ad39;  SNG  M\u00fcnchen, Attika,  Megaris,  \u00c4igina). As  a  long-distance  trading  community,  Aigina  was  not  an active  coloniser,  but  colonised  Kydonia  (no. 968)  in  519, Adria  (no. 75)  c.C 6l,  and  Damastion  in  Illyria  after  431 (Strabo  8.6.16).With  Miletos  (no. 854)  and  Samos  (no. 864), Aigina  was  significant at N aukratis  (no. 1023)  (Hdt. 2.178.3). The  Aiginetan  claim  to  autochthony  (Hellan.  fr. 27)  rest- ed  on  their  identity  as  the  Myrmidons  metamorphosed from  ants  by  Zeus  at  the  behest  of  his  son  Aiakos  (Hes.  fr. 205,  MW;  hence  the  toponym  Myrmidonia:  Steph.  Byz.  s.v. \u00b5).  Historiography  suggests  successive waves  of settlers  (Paus. 2.29.5). 359. ", "Kalaureia": "Identifier: 623, (Kalaureates)  Map. 58.  Lat. 37.30,long. 23.30.

According  to  the  C 3 historian  Antikleides  ((FGrHist 140)  fr. 9)  the  island  was  originally  called  ,but is  attested  as  early  as Hecat.  fr. 125.The  city-ethnic  is  (Syll.\u00b3359.4\u00ad5). Kalaureia  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Ps.-Skylax  52 and  in  the  political  sense  in  a  C 4s  decree:     (Syll. \u00b3359.3\u00ad5)  where  the  city-ethnic  is  used  in the  collective  and  internal  sense.  The  external  individual  use  is attested  in  C 3  honorary  decrees  from  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2  96.43)  and  Delphi  (no. 177)  (SEG 14  402). From  possibly  C 6l  (Hdt. 3.59.1)  and  during  C 5\u00adC4l Kalaureia  was  a  possession  of  Troizen  (no. 357);  the Aristotelian  constitution  of  the  Troizenians  treated Kalaureia  (Arist.  fr. 614),and  the  C 5l  sculptor  Pison  could  be described  as  \"from  Kalaureia  of  the  Troizenians\"  (    ) (Paus.  10.9.8;  cf. 6.3.5).  The island  served  as  a  naval  station:  a  fleet of  Timotheos  used  it 622 figueira in 374  (Dem. 49).  After  the  Lamian  War,  the  polis  is  present- ed  as  the  political  authority  for  a  grant  of  ateleia  to  Siphnos in  IG iv  839  Syll. \u00b3359  (C 4l)).  The  eponymous  magistrate was  a  tamias  (IG iv  839,  841).  [Plut.]  Mor. 846F  has  been taken  to  imply  the  authority  of  local  officials at K alaureia just  before  the  death  of  Demosthenes.  In general,  see  Welter ( 1941)  53\u00ad57. According  to  Ps.-Skylax  52,  Kalaureia  had  a  harbour (limen)  and  its  urban  centre  contained  an  agora  in  which  a (Hellenistic?)  bouleuterion  has  been  excavated  (cf.  IG iv 841.24).  The  nearby Heroon  may  be  connected  with  both Asklepios  and/or  Demosthenes  (IG iv  847;  see  Welter  ( 1941) 51\u00ad52).  At  Kalaureia  was  located  the  sanctuary  of  Poseidon Kalauros,  known  from  C 8e  with  a  temple  from  6Cl,  expand- ed  in  C 5l\u00adC4  (ibid. 45\u00ad50)  and  four  stoas  of  C 5l\u00adC4l (Coulton  ( 1976)  242\u00ad43).The  sanctuary  served  as  an  asylum (Ephor.  fr. 150),  hence  the  alternative  toponym  Eirene.In refuge  there,  Demosthenes  committed  suicide;  and  his \u00b5\u00b5  stood  within  the  sanctuary,  perhaps  represented  by  a circular  foundation  west  of  the  temple  (Attic  decree  cited  in [Plut.]  Mor. 851C;  [Dem.]  Ep. 2.20;Plut.  Dem. 29.1\u00ad30.6).  At some  point,  probably  during  the  First  Peloponnesian  War,  a cult  of    was  begun  in  Attica  or cult  treasures  were transferred  there  from  Kalaureia  (note IG i\u00b3  369.74;  cf.  Thuc. 1.115.1,  4.21.3;  in  general,  see  Wide  and Kjellberg  ( 1895);  Welter  ( 1941)  43\u00ad50). The  Kalaurian  Amphiktyony  centred  on  the  sanctuary  of Poseidon,  having  a  membership  of  Hermion  (no. 350), Epidauros  (no. 348),  Aigina  (no. 358),  Nauplia,  Athens  (no. 361),  Prasiai  (no. 342)  and  Minyan  (Boiotian)  Orchomenos (no. 213);  cf.  Strabo  8.6.14.  Argos  (no. 347)  later  participated for  Nauplia,  and  Sparta  (no. 345)  for  Prasiai.  It may  have orig- inated  c. 700  (before  the  synoecism  of  Troizen)  as  a  sacralized site  for  the  ransoming  of  captives,  redemption  of  property, and  protected  interaction.  The  amphiktyony  existed  in  the Hellenistic  period  (IG iv  842  (C 3  or  C 2)).

Its  status  as  a  polis  in  the  polit- ical  sense  is  indicated  by  its  appearance  among  the  members of  the  Delian  League  in  the  assessment  decree  of 425/4  (IG i\u00b3 71.i.88),where  the  city-ethnic  is  used  in  the  external  and  col- lective  sense.

For Belbina's  proverbial  insignificance see also T eles  (supra). In  the  decree  of 425/4  (supra)  Belbina  was  assessed  at  the modest  sum  of 300  drachms.  Poor  and  sparsely  populated, Belbina  may  not  have  seemed  worth  assessing  before,  in which  case  425  may  be  its  first actual assessment.  Or  Belbina may  have  been  assessed  in  an  apotaxis  from  a  larger  neighbour,  in  which  an  overarching  dependency  on  Athens weakened  an  earlier  regional  subordination.

This  should  put it  between  the  rivers  Selinous  and  Kerynitis  (Morgan  and Hall ( 1996)  175;  Barr.).  The  city,  which  was  overwhelmed  by a  tidal  wave  occasioned  by  an  earthquake  in  373  (Diod. 15.48.1\u00ad49.4;  Polyb. 2.41.7;Strabo 8.7.2;  Paus. 7.24.6;Ael.

The  toponym  is  usually `,  (Hom.  Il. 2.575;  SEG 36  718  (C 5e);  Hdt. 1.145)  or `  (Syll. \u00b390.12),  though  Theophr.  Phys.

The internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  probably  found (abbreviated)  on  C 4  coins  (infra),  and  the  external  collective use  is  found  in  Diod. 15.49.3  (r  ante 373).  A  citizen  of  Helike served  as  Delphic  theorodokos  in  C 5l  (Syll. \u00b390.12).According to Polyb. 2.41.6\u00ad7  (rC 4),  Helike  had  been  a  member  of  the Achaian  Confederacy. The  early  physical  existence  of  Helike  is  attested  in  Hom. Il. 2.575  and  in  a  C 5e  inscription  (SEG 36  718;  see  also  Soter and  Katsonopoulou  ( 1999)).  Archaeological  investigations have  revealed  the  foundations  of  two  small  temples,  one Archaic,  the  other  Classical,  at  Nea  Keryneia,  which  may possibly  be  associated  with  the  acropolis  of  ancient  Helike (Petropoulos  ( 1990)).  The  most  important  sanctuary  at Helike  was,  however,  that  of  Poseidon  Helikonios  (Hom.  Il. 8.203;Diod.  15.49.2\u00ad3;Strabo  8.7.2;  Paus. 7.24.5\u00ad6),  and  it  is quite  likely  that  this  sanctuary  acted  as  a  common  place  of union  for  the  Achaians  prior  to  the  destruction  of Helike,  when  that  function  was  assumed  by  the  sanctuary of  Zeus  Homarios  near  Aigion  (Morgan  and  Hall  ( 1996) 195\u00ad96,  contra  Aymard  ( 1938)  286\u00ad87,  293;  Walbank ( 2000)).

Chil. 37.179  (rC 4s))  and   (Paus. 7.25.8\u00ad9  (r 373))  are  also  found. 480 morgan  and  hall Classified b y  Hdt  1.145  as  a  meros,  it  is  called  a  polis  in  the urban  sense  by  Theophr.  Phys.  op. 12.122  (r 373),  and  retro- spective  evidence  is  furnished  by  Polyb. 2.41.7\u00ad8  (rC 4),  who uses  polis  in  the  political  sense  and  attests  to  its  membership of  the  Achaian  Confederacy  in  the  time  prior  to  Philip  II  and Alexander,  and  by  Diod. 15.48.3  (r 373),  who  uses  the  term  in its  urban  sense.  The  external  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic is  attested  at  Paus. 7.25.8\u00ad9  (r 373);the  external  individual  use is  found  at  Tzetz.  Chil. 37.179  (rC 4s). Boura  was  affected  severely  by  the  earthquake  of 373 which  destroyed  Helike  (no. 235)  (Paus. 7.25.8\u00ad9),  and  is absent  from  the  list  of  Achaian  poleis  in  Ps.-Skylax  42  (C 4f). Pausanias'  comment  ( 7.25.8\u00ad9)  that  Boura  was  swiftly refounded  by  inhabitants  who  had  been  away  on  military service  during  the  earthquake  may  find some c onfirmation in  the  archaeological  record  from  Kastro  (if,  indeed,  Kastro is  to  be  identified w ith  ancient  Boura;  see  supra)  which appears  to  indicate  virtual  continuity  from  the  late Archaic/early  Classical  period  through  until  Roman  times (Lauffer  ( 1989)  160;  Rizakis  ( 1995)  209\u00ad12;  Morgan  and  Hall ( 1996)  175).  If  so,  then  Ovid's  assertion  (Met. 15.293\u00ad95)  that a  city  named  Buris  was  under  water  by  his  own  day  is  either mistaken  or  indicates  that  Buris  should  not  be  identified with  Boura.  That  Boura  was  a  polis  after  its  refoundation  is virtually  certain,  since  in  C 3  the  collective city-ethnic  is  used internally  (SEG 1  1122),  while  the  external  use  of  the  city- ethnic  for  an  individual  is  also  attested  (SEG 174  ( 229/8));  cf. also  Tzetz.  Chil. 37.179  (rC 4s).  Similarly,  in  C 3m  a  citizen  of Boura  named  Archedamos  was  granted  proxenia  by Thermon  (IG ix  1.1\u00b2  12e);  cf.  also  Polyb. 2.41.7\u00ad8.  That  Boura was  a  polis  prior  to  its  destruction  is  impossible  to  prove, although  it  is  highly  likely. There  is  no  explicit  testimony  that  Boura  engaged  in  any colonial  ventures  to  South  Italy,  though  this  is  sometimes assumed  on  the  basis  of  the  homonymy  between  the  river Sybaris  in  Sybarite  territory  and  the  Sybaris  spring  near Boura  (Dunbabin  ( 1948)  24;  B\u00e9rard  ( 1957)  141;Koerner ( 1974)  464;  Giangiulio  ( 1989)  166\u00ad67). 234.Dyme  (Dymaios)  Map  58.  Lat. 38.10,long.  21.35.Size of  territory:?  Type:  [A].  Paus. 7.17.5  locates  Dyme  near  the river  Larisos,  marking  the  border  between  Achaia  and  Elis, which  has  led  to  its  being  associated  with  modern  Kato Achaia  (Rizakis  ( 1995)  156;  Barr.).  The  toponym  is  normally \u00b5,  (Hdt 1.145;  Thuc. 2.84.5;Ephor.  fr. 84;  Ps.-Skylax 42), though  \u00b5  (IdiCos  ED 232.14  (C 2)), \u00b5  (Plut.  Cleom. 14.4)  and  \u00b5  (Etym.  Magn. 291.12\u00ad16)  are  also  attested. The  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5  (Ephor.  fr. 84;  SEG 14  375  (C 4l)). Hdt. 1.145  lists  it  among  the  original  twelve  mere  of Achaia,  but  the  only  Classical  source  to  call  it  a  polis  in  the urban  sense  is  Ps.-Skylax  42,  where  it  is  listed  as  the  seventh toponym  after  the  heading  ... ;Polyb.  2.41.7\u00ad8 (rC 4)  calls  it  a  polis  in  the  political  sense,  and  attests  to  its membership  of  the  Achaian  Confederacy  prior  to the  time of  Philip  II  and  Alexander  (cf.  SEG 14  375  (C 4l)).  The  inter- nal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  abbreviated  on C 4m  coins  (infra);  the  external  collective  use  is  found  in Ephor.  fr. 84;  the  external  individual  use  is  found  in Theopomp.  fr. 194  and  probably  in  SEG 14  375  (C 4l). Strabo  says  that  Dyme  was  synoecised  from  eight  demoi ( 8.3.2;  Moggi,  Sin. 121\u00ad25),  and  there  are  other  indications  in generally  late  sources  that  the  toponym  was  adopted  rela- tively  late.  Thus  Paus. 7.17.5  says  that  Dyme's  original  name was  Paleia,  while  Steph.  Byz.  (s.v. \u00b5) say that its original name  was  Stratos;  Strabo  8.7.5  compromises  by  hypothesis- ing  that  Dyme  was  originally  called  Paleia  and  then  Stratos. \u00b2 It  is  possible  that  Paleia  and  Stratos  were  the  names  of  two  of the  demoi  that  were  synoecised,  along  with  the  of Teuthea  (Strabo  8.3.11;  Morgan  and  Hall  ( 1996)  186\u00ad87). Determining  the  date  of  this  synoecism  is  not  easy:  the toponym  Paleia  is  attested  as  the  of  an  athlete  named Oibotas  on  the  base  of  a  dedication  referring  to  an  Olympic victory  in  756  but  erected  in  460  (Paus. 7.17.7,  cf. 6.3.8; Olympionikai 6),  though  the  name  of  Dyme  appears  to  be familiar  already  to  Hecat.  fr. 121  (c. 500).  Koerner  ( 1974)  469 argues  that  Dyme  must  have  been  synoecised  prior  to  496, the  year  in  which  Pataikos  of  Dyme  won  the  trotting  race  at Olympia  (Paus. 5.9.1;  Olympionikai 171),  though  Pausanias does  not  attach  the  city-ethnic  to  Pataikos'  name  but  merely says  that  he  was  an  Achaian  from  Dyme.  Demand  ( 1990) 61\u00ad64  suggests  that  the  synoecism  that  Strabo  imagines must  have  involved  the  incorporation  of  Olenos  (no. 238)-- an  event  that  would  have  to  postdate  Hdt. 1.145.On  the  other hand,  the  city-ethnic,  which  is  certainly  used  on  coinage dating  to  C 4m  (infra),  is  already  attached  to  Oibotas'  name on  the  retrospective  victory  dedication  mentioned  above. This  should  indicate  that  Dyme  was  a  synoecised  polis  by 460.  At  this  point,  the  demoi  may  have  been  reorganised within  the  three  phylai  of  Stratis  (or  Spatis),  Dymaia  and Thesmiaia,  which  are  attested  in  C 3  (Syll. \u00b3  531,  with  Jones, POAG 130\u00ad32).  By  C 3,  an  eponymous  magistrate  named  the theokolos  is  attested  (Sherk  ( 1990)  258),  though  there  is  no way  of  determining  the  antiquity  of  this  office. \u00b2  The  phrase       [],     '   &lt; &gt;   &lt;&gt;  does  not  appear  in  all  manuscripts.  It  is  included  in  the  Bud\u00e9 edition  but  omitted  from  the  Loeb. achaia  481 A  late  tradition  told  of  a  war  between  Dyme  and  Elis  (no. 251)  in  668  (Euseb.  Chron. 1.28;  Philostr.  Gymn. 7),though  this provides  no  explicit  indications  of  Dyme's  status  in  the Archaic  period.  In  367,  it  was  \"liberated\"  along  with Naupaktos  (no. 165)  and  Kalydon  (no. 148)  by  Epameinondas of  Thebes  (Diod. 15.75.2). According  to  Steph.  Byz.  (s.v. \u00b5),  the  original  name of  the  chora  was \u00b5,  while  for  Polyb. 2.51.3  and  Paus. 7.17.3  it  was \u00b5.The  chora  included  the  polichne  of Teuthea  (Strabo 8.3.11)  and  the  phrourion  of  Teichos (Polyb. 4.59.4).  The  archaeological  evidence  suggests  a  dis- persed  settlement  pattern  until  well  into  the  Classical  peri- od  (Morgan  and  Hall  ( 1996)  189),  with  the  foundations  of  a small  Archaic  temple  being  found  at  Santameri,  in  the south  of  the  territory  of  Dyme  (ArchDelt 22  B( 1967)  216), and  Classical  elements--possibly  to  be  associated  with  the temple  of  Athena  Larisaia  (Paus. 7.17)--being  found  to  the south-west,  at  Katarchia.  An  urban  centre  is  attested  c. 400 by  Antimachos  of  Kolophon  (apud  Steph.  Byz.  s.v. \u00b5), who  refers  to \u00b5  ,  though  archaeological  evi- dence  suggests  the  existence  of  settlement  in  the  area  of  the later  centre  already  from  the  Archaic  period  (Morgan  and Hall  ( 1996)  187). In 496,  Pataikos  of  Dyme  won  the  trotting  race  at Olympia  (Olympionikai 171).On  Oibotas  of  Paleia,  see  supra 473\u00ad74.

Paus. 7.22.1  situates  Pharai  near the  river  Peiros,  and  it  is  probably  to  be  located  at  the  mod- ern  village  of  Prevedos  on  the  left  bank  of  the  river  (Rizakis ( 1995)  186;  Barr.).  The  toponym  is  regularly  (Polyb. 2.41.8),  though  ,  is  attested  in  a  C 4  inscription  (IG xii.8637).

Designated  by  Hdt. 1.145  as  one  of  the  original  twelve  mere of  Achaia,  Pharai  is  absent  from  Ps.-Skylax's  list  of  Achaian poleis  ( 42),  though  in  this  case  the  negative  evidence  should not  be  overstressed,  since  we  would  not  expect  to  find an inland  settlement  recorded  in  a  treatise  composed  as  a periplous  (Morgan  and  Hall  ( 1996)  167).  Polyb. 2.41.7\u00ad8  states that  Pharai  was  one  of  the  Achaian  poleis  (in  the  political sense)  that  constituted  the  Achaian  Confederacy  prior  to  the time  of  Philip  II  and  Alexander.  The  external  collective  use  of the  city-ethnic  is  found  in  Hdt. 1.145  and  Polyb. 2.41.12  (r 280); the  external  individual  use  is  found  in  IG v.2392  (C 4\u00adC3).

It  is  possible,  however,  that  the  reference  is  to Arkadian  Phara  (no. 290).A  citizen  of  Pharai  was  appointed proxenos  and  theorodokos  by  Arkadian  Lousoi  (no. 279)  in C 4\u00adC3  (IG v.2392).

The  toponym  is  (- ),  (BCH 70  ( 1946)  39B; Paus. 7.26.10). Paus. 7.26.10  calls  Phelloe  a  \u00b5  and  claims  that  it had  been  settled  ever  since  the  Ionian  occupation  of  Achaia. A  C 4m  decree  granting  Delphic  proxenia  to an     (BCH 70  ( 1946)  39B)  indicates  that  Phelloe  was  a polis  in  the  political  sense  by  C 4.  If  an  eponymous  mythical hero  named  Phellos,  mentioned  in  Hes.  fr. 167  (MW),  is  to be associated  with  Achaian  Phelloe  (see  West  ( 1985)  91),  this might  suggest  the  existence  of  a  political  community  in  the Archaic  period.  Certainly,  surface  exploration  and  limited excavation  in  the  area  have  revealed  settlement  evidence  and burials  dating  from  C 8s  and  continuing  into  the  Archaic  and Classical  periods  (Alzinger  ( 1986)  319\u00ad26;  Morgan  and  Hall ( 1996)  174). 243.Rhypes  (Rhyps) Map  58.

The  identification is not c ertain,  but  it  is  often located  on  the  Trapeza  hill, 7  km  west  of  Aigion  (Rizakis ( 1995)  193;  Morgan  and  Hall  ( 1996)  179;  Barr.).  The  toponym is `  (Ps.-Skylax  42), `  (Strabo  8.7.5;  Paus. 7.18.7) or `  (Diod. 8.17.1).  Steph.  Byz. 548.4  also  attests `.

That  status  may  possibly  be  retrojected, however,  since  according  to  Phot.  Lex.p. 492.10,  Aischylos (fr. 394,  Nauck)  had  described  Rhypes  as  a  '   .  An  even  earlier  attestation  of  what appears  to  be  the  external  individual  city-ethnic  `(  )[ ] in  an  Archaic  inscription  (SGDI 1644)  may  just  possibly indicate  that  Rhypes  was  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  during C 6.  In  C 4l,  the  external  application  of  the  individual  city- ethnic  is  attested  in  SEG 14  375.  The  external  collective use  of the  city-ethnic  is  found  in  Hdt. 1.145  (cf.  Pherecydes (FGrHist 3)  fr. 163).  C 4l  membership  of  the  Achaian Confederacy  is  suggested  by SEG 14  375.8. Anderson  ( 1954)  73  suggests  that  Rhypes  was  abandoned  in C 4,  though  this  does  not  accord  with  the  archaeological  evi- dence  (Rizakis  ( 1995)  193\u00ad94;  Morgan  and  Hall  ( 1996)  216  n. 19;  Vordos  (forthcoming)),  and  it  would  appear  that  it  per- sisted  until  its  destruction  by  Augustus,  when  its  territory  was distributed  between  Aigion  (no. 231)  and  Pharai  (no. 241) (Strabo  8.7.5),as  well  as  Patrai  (no. 239)  (Paus. 7.18.7).The  ter- ritory  of  Rhypes  is  designated  variously  (   ` (Thuc. 7.34.1);    `  (Strabo  8.7.5)),  and seems  to  have  included  Erineos,  in  the  vicinity  of  the  modern Lambiri  (Thuc. 7.34.1),  and  Leuktron  (Strabo  8.7.5). Kroton  (no. 56)  in  South  Italy  was  reputedly  founded  by Myskellos  of  Rhypes  (Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 10;Hippys of Rhegion  (FGrHist 554)  fr. 1;  Ps.-Skymnos  325;Diod.8.17;Dion.

The  external  collective  use  of  the  city-eth- nic  appears  in  Hdt. 1.145  and  Polyb. 2.41.12.

Cicero (ad  Att. 6.2.2)  implies  that  Tritaia  was  attached  to Arkadia  after  the  foundation  of  Megalopolis  (no. 282),  but this  is  contradicted  by Paus. 6.12.8\u00ad9,  who  appears  to  attest Tritaia's  independence  in  C 2m  (cf.

Demand  ( 1990)  61\u00ad64  argues  that  this must  have  taken  place  after  the  time  at  which  Herodotos  was writing,  though  Strabo  8.7.1  seems  to  imply  that  Olenos  still existed  by  280;  it  had  certainly  been  abandoned  by  C 2 (Polyb. 2.41.7).  The  territory (called     by Soph.  fr. 300,  Radt)  probably  included  the  settlements  of  Peirai  and Euryteiai  (Paus. 7.18.2).According  to  an  ancient  commenta- tor  (schol.  vet.  Pind.  Ol. 1.37a),  Pelops  is  supposed  to  have originated  from  the  polis  of  Olenos. 239.Patrai  (Patreus) Map  58.Lat.38.15,long.21.45.Size  of territory:  ?  Type:  [A].  The  toponym  is  ,  (Thuc. 2.83.3;  Ps.-Skylax 42).  The  city-ethnic  is  (Hdt. 1.145;  Thuc. 5.52.2;  SEG 14  375  (C 4l)),  though   appears  to  be  attested  in  Polyb. 5.30.3,  95.7. Underlying  the  modern  coastal  city  of  Patras  (Barr.), Patrai  is  listed  by  Hdt. 1.145  as  one  of  the  original  twelve  mere of  Achaia  and  is  described  as  a  polis  (in  the  urban  sense)  by Ps.-Skylax 42  (C 4f),  where  it  is  listed  as  the  sixth  toponym after  the  heading  ... .  That  it  was  considered  to be  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  during  C 5l  is  rendered  likely  by Thucydides'  notice  ( 5.52.2)  that  in  419  the  citizens  of  Patrai were  persuaded  by  Alkibiades  to  extend  their  walls  down  to the  sea;  traces  of  these  long  walls  have  recently  been  found (ArchDelt 52  ( 1997)  Chron. 273\u00ad75).  Polyb. 2.41.7\u00ad8  (rC 4) calls  it  a  polis  in  the  political  sense,  and  attests  to  its  mem- bership  of  the  Achaian  Confederacy  prior  to the  time  of Philip  II  and  Alexander  (cf.  SEG 14  375.9  (C 4l)).The  external collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  in  Hdt. 1.145  and Thuc. 5.52.2,the  external  individual  use  in  SEG 14  375.9  (C 4l) and  Paus. 6.4.6  (rC 4s). According  to  tradition,  Patrai  was  originally  formed  by the  synoecism  of  Aroe,  Antheia  and  Mesatis  (Paus. 7.18.2\u00ad6), \u00b3  The  phrase  `        &lt; &gt;    does  not  appear  in  all  manuscripts.  It  is  includ- ed  in  the  Bud\u00e9  edition  but  omitted  from  the  Loeb. achaia  483 three  communities  which  shared  the  common  cult  of Artemis  Triklaria  (Paus. 7.19.1).  In  279,  Patrai  underwent  a dioikismos,  and  its  inhabitants  settled  in  the  polismata  of Mesatis,  Antheia,  Boline,  Argyra  and  Arba  as  well  as  Patrai (Paus. 7.18.6).This  suggested  to  Curtius  (( 1851)  437,453)  that these  polismata  had  formerly  been  demoi,  which  had  earlier been  incorporated  through  a  second  process  of  synoecism. Moggi,  Sin. 89\u00ad95  dates  this  latter  synoecism  to  C 6l  or  C 5e, though  it  is  worth  noting  that  Herodotos'  use  in  his  list  of Achaian  mere  ( 1.145)  of  the  plural  city-ethnic  rather  than  the toponym  may  suggest  that  a  multifocal  settlement  pattern still  existed  in  C 5m  (Nilsson  ( 1951)  22\u00ad23).  In  429,  the Peloponnesian  fleet used P atrai,  Panormos  and  Rhion  as naval  bases  (Thuc. 2.83.3,  86.1\u00ad2,  92.5),  and  this  has  suggest- ed  to  Larsen  ( 1953)  802\u00ad3  that  Patrai  was  by  this  time  part  of the  Peloponnesian  League. The  territory was  called  (Theophr.  Hist.  pl. 9.15.8,  20.2)  and  included  the  naval  station  of  Panormos-- modern  Golimi--(Thuc. 2.86.1,  4,  cf. 2.92.1)  together  with the  settlements  which  were  later  to  be  resettled  after  dioik- ismos. In C 4m,  Cheilon  of  Patrai  won  a  string  of  wrestling  victo- ries  at  the  Isthmian,  Nemean,  Olympic  (Olympionikai 461, 465)  and  Pythian  Games  (Paus  6.4.6\u00ad7). 240.Pellene  (Pelleneus)  Map  58.  Lat. 38.05,long.  22.35. Size of  territory: 3  or 4.  Type:  A.  The  Attic\u00adIonic  form  of  the toponym  is  regularly  ,  (Hom.  Il. 2.574;  Hdt. 1.145; Xen.  Hell. 7.2.18;  Ps.-Skylax 42);  the  epichoric  form  is ()  (SEG 11  1272  (C 6);  IG iv  510  (C 6l);  Pind.  Ol. 9.98),  though  is  also  attested  (Steph.  Byz. 515.12). The  city-ethnic  is  in Attic\u00adIonic (Thuc.2.9.2;IG ii\u00b2  1388A.34  ( 398/7))  and  in  the  epichoric  dialect (SEG 383  ( 365\u00ad335);  IG ii\u00b2  220  ( 344/3));  later  sources  retro- spectively  use   (Cic.  ad  Att. ii  2;Plut.  Mor. 399B). is  also  attested  (Lycoph.  Alex. 922). Almost  certainly  to  be  located  on  the  Tserkova  hill  near the  modern  village  of  Pellini  (Rizakis  ( 1995)  225;  Barr.), Pellene  is  the  best-documented  polis  of  Achaia.  It  is  called  a polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Xen.  Hell. 7.4.18  and  Ps.-Skylax  42, where  it  is  listed  as  the  first t oponym  after  the  heading ... ,  and  in  the  political  sense  by  Thuc. 8.3.2  and Xen.  Hell. 6.5.29.  In  an  honorific decree for some P ellenian presbeis  passed  by  the  Athenians  in  C 4m  (IG ii\u00b2  220),  [   ][] is restored in 15\u00ad16.Polyb. 2.41.7\u00ad8  attests  to  its  membership  of  the  Achaian Confederacy  in  the  time  prior  to Philip  II  and  Alexander. There  was  a     among  the  158  constitu- tions  collected  by Aristotle  (frr. 583\u00ad84),and  Dikaiarchos  (fr. 69,Wehrli)  wrote  a  similar  work  (Cic.  ad  Att. ii  2).Polites  and demos  are  found  in  [Dem.]  17.10. The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found (abbreviated)  on  C 4s  coins  (infra);  the  external  collective use is  attested  in  Thuc. 2.9.2,  8.3.2;Xen.  Hell. 6.5.29;  and  IG ii\u00b2 220.8  ( 344/3).  The  external  individual  use  is  attested  in  Xen. Hell. 3.2.11  and  IG ii\u00b2  1388A.34  ( 398/7)  and  SEG 383  ( 365\u00ad335). The  fact  that  a  homonymous  kome  of  Pellene  existed between  Pellene  and  Aigion  (no. 231)  (Strabo  8.7.5)  may  sug- gest  that  the  polis  of  Pellene  was  the  result  of  a  series  of  syn- oecisms  to  which  one  of  its  constitutents  gave  its  name (Koerner  ( 1974)  468;  Morgan  and  Hall  ( 1996)  171).  Other possible  participants  in  this  synoecism  are  Mysaion  (Paus. 7.27.9),  Kyros  (Paus. 7.27.11),  the  harbour  of  Aristonautai (Paus. 7.26.14,  cf. 2.12.2),  Poseidion--which is e xplicitly called  a  \u00b5  (Paus. 7.27.8)--and Olouros,  which  Xen. Hell. 7.4.17  describes  as  being  besieged  by  the  Pelleneis  after its  capture  by  the  Arkadians  (thus  implying  some  form  of urban  settlement). According  to  tradition,  Pellene  was  exposed  to  andra- podismos  and  destroyed  by  Sikyon  (no. 228)  in  C 6e,  but refounded  shortly  afterwards  (Zenob. 1.57,  citing Anaxandridas  (FGrHist 404)  fr. 1;  P  Oxy. 1241.iii.2\u00ad12,  citing Aristotle  (not  in  Gigon), 1365.28\u00ad45).  This  is  not  definitive proof  of  Pellene's  status  as  a  polis  in  the  Archaic  period  (con- tra  Koerner  ( 1974)  469),and  it  may  be  that  the  settlement  that was  destroyed  was  the  kome  of  Pellene  (Haussoullier  ( 1917) 165\u00ad66).  At  the  outbreak  of  the  Peloponnesian  War  in  431, Pellene  was  the  first A chaian  city  to  join  the  Peloponnesian League  (Thuc. 2.9.2\u00ad3;  cf.  Ar.  Lys. 996);  it  was  still  allied  with Sparta  (no. 345)  shortly  after  the  battle  of  Leuktra (Xen.  Hell. 7.2.2);  action  by  its  naval  forces  is  attested  at  the  battle  of Abydos  in  411  (Thuc. 8.106.3;Diod.  13.40.5;  cf.  Thuc. 2.9.3, 8.3.2,  attesting  to  naval  forces);  infantry  forces  are  attested  at Thuc. 5.60.3,  at  the  battle  of  the  Nemea  in  395  (Xen.  Hell. 4.2.20),  at  Oneion  in  369  (Xen.  Hell. 7.1.15\u00ad16)  and  at Lechaion  in  369  (Paus. 9.15.4).In  367,following  the  expulsion of  oligarchs  from  the  poleis  of  Achaia,  Pellene  allied  herself with  Thebes  (no. 221)  (Xen.  Hell. 7.2.11),though  the  oligarchs swiftly  resumed  power  and  forged  new  alliances  with  both Sparta  and  Elis  (no. 251)  (Xen.  Hell. 7.4.16\u00ad18).In  the  330s,the Makedonians  installed  the  tyrant  Chairon  ([Dem.]  17.10; Paus. 7.27.7;  Ath. 509B)  and  Pellene  was  the  only  Achaian  city not  to  join  King  Agis'  anti-Makedonian  league  (Aeschin. 3.165;Curt.  6.1).  By  and  large,  the  constitution  of  Pellene  was normally  oligarchic,  and  according  to  Harp.  s.v. , the  Aristotelian     attested  the  existence 484 morgan  and  hall of  magistrates  named  mastroi  (fr. 583).A  period  of  democra- cy  is  implied  by  [Dem.]  17.10. C 4  sees  a  number  of  citizens  of  Pellene  appointed  to diplomatic  offices:  apart  from  the  hospitality  afforded  to presbeis  of  Pellene  by Athens  (IG ii\u00b2  220  ( 344/3)),  a  similar invitation  to  dine  in  the  Athenian  prytaneion  is  proffered  to Andrion,  son  of  Pausanias  (SEG 383  ( 365\u00ad335));  Xen.  Hell. 7.2.16  refers  to a  proxenos  of  the  Phliasians  (no. 355);  in 340/39,  Ekephylos,  son  of  Charmides,  was  granted  proxenia, politeia,  promanteia  and  prodikia  by  Delphi  (no. 177)  (BCH 23  ( 1899)  349);  and  shortly  after  338,  Oikles  was  granted proxenia  by  the  Boiotians  (SEG 25  553). Pellene's  renown  in  the  Panhellenic  athletic  circuit  dates back  as  far  as  542,  when  Phanas  won  victories  in  the  stade, the  diaulos  and  the  hoplitodromos  at  the  Olympic  Games (Euseb.  Chron. 1.67;  Olympionikai 142\u00ad44).  Sostratos  won  a victory  in  the  boys'  foot-race  at  Olympia  in  460  (Paus. 6.8.1; Olympionikai 263),  Promachos  won  the  Olympic  pankra- tion  in  404  (Paus. 7.27.5;  Olympionikai 355)  and  in  the  third quarter  of  C 4  the  tyrant  Chairon  won  two  wrestling  victo- ries  at  Isthmia  and  four  at  Olympia  (Paus. 7.27.5; Olympionikai 432,437,443,447).A  victory  in  boys'  boxing  by Philip,  described  as      ,  is recorded by Paus. 6.8.5  and  dated  to  436  in  Olympionikai 319  (see  Nielsen and  Roy  ( 1998)  36\u00ad39).  Pellene  even  hosted  her  own  prize games,  known  variously  as  the  Heraia  (schol.  Ar.  Av. 1421), the  Hermaia  (schol.  Ar.  Av. 1421;  schol.  Pind.  Ol. 9.116c)  or the  Theoxenia  (Paus  7.27.4;  schol.  Pind.  Ol. 7.156a).  The games  are  already  attested  by  C 6l  (IG iv  510;  Anth.  Pal. 13.19; cf.  Bacchyl. 9.33,  Jebb). A  cult  to  (Zeus)  Mellichios  is  known  in  C 6  (SEG 11  1272), but  Apollo's  importance  at  Pellene  is  suggested  by  the  depiction  of  his  head  on  silver  and  bronze  coins  dating  to the  period  370\u00ad322  (Head,  HN \u00b2415). Pellene  struck  coins  in  both  silver  (triobols)  and  bronze in  C 4s:  obv.  head  of  Apollo  or  a  lyre;  rev.  tripod  or  ram's  head in  a  wreath.

The toponym  usually  denotes  the  town  (Ant. 5.23;  Thuc. 3.18.4; Ps.-Skylax 97),  but  sometimes  the  town  plus  its  hinter- land  (SEG 36  750.17  (C 4s))  and  sometimes  the  political  com- munity  (Hdt. 5.11.2;Dem.  40.37).

Mytilene  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  (IG xii.24.7,17 suppl.  p. 2  (C 4m);  Thuc. 3.3.3;Xen.  Hell. 1.6.19),  in  the political  sense  (Alc.  fr. 348;  IG xii.295.3  (C 4)  SEG 28  690; Ant. 5.77;  Thuc. 3.13.7;Dem.  40.37)  and  in  the  territorial sense  (Ant. 5.76;  IG xii.26  passim;  SEG 36  750.2\u00ad3,  15,  19 (C 4s)).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  inter- nally  on  coins  (infra)  and  in  inscriptions  (IG xii.24.5 (C 4m);  SEG 36  750.9  (C 4s))  and  externally  in  inscriptions (IG ii\u00b2  213.7  ( 347/6);  F.Delphes iii.4400.3  (C 4l/C3e))  and  in literary  sources  (Ant. 5.76;  Thuc. 3.2.3;  Arist.  Pol. 1285a35). For  the  individual  and  external  use,  see  at  Pl.  Prt. 343A  and  `  in  a  C 4s  healing  inscription  from  Epidauros  (IG iv\u00b2.1 121.122).  Patris  is  found  in  Antiph. 5.62  and 79. The  territory  of  Mytilene  may  have  covered  c. 450\u00ad500 km \u00b2  (Kontes  ( 1978)  figs. 19\u00ad22).  To the  north  it  bordered  on Methymna,  and  the  frontier  may  have  been  as  far  north  as Cape  Tsakm\u00e1k  (Mason  ( 1993)  231\u00ad48).According  to  Labarre ( 1996)  194),  it  ran  south  of  Aigeiros,  but  see  supra  regarding the  problems  in  identification of  this  site.  To  the  west Mytilene  bordered  on  Pyrrha  and  was  separated  from  this polis  by  the  \"pine-covered  Pyrrhaian  mountain\"  (Theophr. Hist.  pl. 3.9.5)  on  the  slopes  of  Mt.  Olympos.  There  is  no  evi- dence  of  ancient  settlements  in  this  large  area,  and  the  forest may  have  been  a  no  man's  land  separating  Mytilene  from Pyrrha  (Spencer  ( 1996)).The  presumption  is  that  the  region east  and  south  of  the  forest  belonged  to  Mytilene. By  the  Classical  period,  it  appears  that  Mytilene's  territo- ry  was  not  fertile  enough  to  feed  its  population,  and  imports from  Bosporos  are  attested  in  428  (Thuc. 3.2.2).  In  C 4m Leukon  of  Bosporos  granted  Mytilene  a  reduction  in  export duty.  As  restored,  the  inscription  implies  that  the Mytilenaians'  annual  import  exceeded  100,000  medimnoi (IG xii  suppl. 3  Tod 163  (C 4m)),  enough  to  feed  a  popula- tion  of  c. 20,000  persons. Mytilene  was  the  greatest  of  the  Aiolian  poleis,  and  in  the Archaic  period  had  significant involvement in e vents  outside the  island.  In  this  respect  it  appears  largely  set  apart  from  the other  Lesbian  poleis,  and  Mytilene's  focus  beyond  events  in the  island  may  well  have  exacerbated  its  infamous  social  stasis at  this  time  (Spencer  ( 2000)  and  infra).  In  the  C 7s  Mytilene acquired  a  peraia  in  the  Troas,  with  Sigeion  and  Achilleion  as the  two  most  prominent  centres.  C. 620,  however,  Athenian settlers  under  Phrynon  took  Sigeion.  In the  following  war between  Mytilene  and  Athens,  the  Mytilenaians  were  defeat- ed  in  a  battle  in  which  the  poet  Alkaios  lost  his  shield,  but  they then  regained  Sigeion,  allegedly  after  a  duel  that  Pittakos  won against  Phrynon.  The  war  ended  with  an  arbitration  by Periander,  the  tyrant  of  Corinth,  whereby  the  Athenians  were awarded  Sigeion.  They  probably  lost  it  again,  since,  in  the end,  it  was  Peisistratos  who  seized  Sigeion  from  Mytilene (Strabo  13.2.38;  Hdt. 5.94\u00ad95,  where  Hdt.  has  mixed  up  and misdated  some  of  the  events;  cf.  Schachermeyr  ( 1950) 1867\u00ad68).  In  the  same  period  the  Mytilenaians,  as  the  only Aiolians,  were  co-colonisers  of  Naukratis  in  the  reign  of Amasis  (Hdt. 2.178.2;  see  Spencer  ( 2000)  75\u00ad76). At  some  point  in  C 6s  Mytilene  came  under  Persian  rule, and  Mytilenaian  ships  served  in  Kambyses'  fleet when he invaded  Egypt  in  525  (Hdt. 3.13\u00ad14).  Mytilene  took  part  in the  Ionian  Revolt  in  499  (Hdt. 6.5.2)  and  must  have  provid- ed  the  majority  of  the  seventy  Lesbian  ships  which  fought  at Lade  in  494  (Hdt. 6.8.2).After  the  defeat,  the  entire  island  of Lesbos  was  systematically  ravaged  by  the  Persians  (Hdt. 6.31.1).  The  Mytilenaians  must  have  fought  on  the  Persian side  in  480/79  (Hdt. 8.85),  but  Lesbos  joined  the  Greeks  in 479  (Hdt. 9.106.4). The  Mytilenaians  were  members  of  the  Delian  League. The  Lesbians  were  among  those  who  in  478  encouraged  the Athenians  to  replace  Sparta  as  the  hegemon  in  the  war against  Persia,  and  the  Mytilenaians  were  among  the  origi- nal  members  of  the  League  (Thuc. 3.10.2\u00ad4;Plut.Arist.23.4). They  remained  autonomoi  and  eleutheroi  until  their  revolt in 428,  and  instead  of  paying  phoros,  they  took  part  in  the campaigns  with  their  armed  forces  (Thuc. 3.10.5,  11.1,  3,  39.2; Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 24.2).  The  Lesbians,  including  Mytilene,  pro- vided  ships  against  Samos  in  440/39  (Thuc. 1.116.2,  117.2; Diod. 12.27.4,  28.2)  and  against  the  Lakedaimonians  and 1026 hansen,  spencer  and  williams their  allies  during  the  first y ears  of  the  Peloponnesian  War (Thuc. 2.9.5,  56.2,  3.3.4).  Accordingly,  they  are  not  recorded in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists. In 428  Mytilene  and  the  other  Lesbian  poleis  except Methymna  defected  from  Athens  (Thuc. 3.2\u00ad18,  25,  27\u00ad50; Diod. 12.55,  derived  from  Thuc.).  Behind  the  revolt,  planned already  before  the  outbreak  of  the  Peloponnesian  War (Thuc. 3.2.1\u00ad2),was  the  Mytilenaians'  attempt  to  go  through with  a  synoecism  of  Lesbos,  their  success  in  winning  the control  of  Antissa,  Eresos  and  Pyrrha,  and  the  Athenians' opposition  to  the  synoecism  (Thuc. 2.3,  3.1,  5.1,  18.1;  Moggi, Sin. 189\u00ad97).  The  Athenians  sent  a  fleet t o  Mytilene  (Thuc. 3.2),  and  after  an  abortive  armistice  ( 4.4)  the  harbours  of Mytilene  were  blockaded  by  the  Athenian  squadron  ( 6.1).At a  meeting  held  in  Olympia  Mytilenaian  envoys  obtained  an alliance  with  the  Peloponnesian  League  ( 3.8\u00ad15).  Reinforced by 1,000  hoplites,  the  Athenians  built  a  blockading  wall  and besieged  Mytilene  ( 18.3\u00ad4).  A  Peloponnesian  army  invaded Attika  in  427,  but  the  relieving  squadron  under  a  Spartan nauarch  never  reached  Mytilene  ( 3.26.1,  29\u00ad33).  The Mytilenaians  were  starved  into  unconditional  surrender ( 3.28.1);  and  the  members  of  the  oligarchic  faction  were  sent to Athens  ( 3.35.1).  The  Athenians  decided  first t o  expose Mytilene  to  an  andrapodismos  ( 3.36.2),but  went  back  on  this decision  the  following  day  ( 3.49.1)  and  concluded  peace  on the  following  terms:  the  oligarchs  sent  to  Athens,  over  1,000 men,  were  held  responsible  for  the  revolt  and  executed;  the other  Mytilenaians  were  forced  to  pull  down  their  walls,  to surrender  their  fleet,  to  cede  their  possessions  in  the  peraia to  Athens,  and  to  have  their  hinterland  divided  into  3,000 kleroi,  of  which  300  were  made  sacred  property and  2,700 were  given  to  Athenian  klerouchs  ( 3.50)  (Figueira  ( 1991) 8\u00ad10,  251\u00ad53).  Mytilene  became  a  dependent  polis  deprived of  its  hinterland,  but  not  of  its  urban  centre.  Thus,  there  is no  basis  for  Hampl's  view  (( 1939)  1\u00ad2)  that  it  became  a  polis without  territory  (Hansen  ( 1998)  55).  Shortly  afterwards, however,  perhaps  already  in  427/6,  the  Mytilenaians  recov- ered  their  autonomia  (IG i\u00b3  66.12)  and  the  possession  of  their hinterland  (IG i\u00b3  66.11\u00ad12,  18,  67.3\u00ad4;  Mattingly  ( 1996) 136\u00ad37);  but  see  Hornblower  ( 1991)  440\u00ad41).  In  412  Mytilene followed  Chios  and  revolted  against  Athens  once  again (Thuc. 8.22.2),but  was  almost  immediately  recovered  by  the Athenians  ( 23.2,  100.3),  and  it  remained  loyal  to  Athens (Diod. 13.73.5;Xen.  Hell. 1.6.35,  38)  until  it  was  taken  by Lysander  in  405  (Xen.  Hell. 2.2.5). In 394  the  Mytilenaians  joined  the  coalition  organised  by Konon  (Diod. 14.84.3),  and  with  his  help  they  succeeded  in 389  in  expelling  the  Lakedaimonians  from  Eresos  and Antissa  (Diod. 14.94.3\u00ad4;Xen.  Hell. 4.8.28\u00ad29).  Alongside Chios,  Rhodos  and  Byzantion,  Mytilene  was  a  founding member  of  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League.  A  separate treaty  between  Athens  and  Mytilene  was  concluded  in  the autumn  of 378  (IG ii\u00b2  40),  and  Mytilene  is  listed  among  the allies  in  the  so-called  Charter  of  the  League  (IG ii\u00b2 43.80  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 257).  The  Mytilenaians  fought  beside the  Athenians  in  the  war  against  the  Peloponnesian  League (IG ii\u00b2  107;Isoc.  14.28)  and  approved  of  an  Athenian  garri- son  placed  in  Mytilene  in,  probably, 375  (SEG 19  204;  Dreher ( 1995)  28).  When  Kammys  became  tyrant  of  Mytilene  in C 4m,  the  city  seceded  from  the  League  (Dem. 40.37),  but  it was  readmitted  through  a  new  alliance  concluded  in  347/6 (IG ii\u00b2  213;  Cargill  ( 1980)  95).  Mytilene  was  allied  with Alexander  the  Great  (Arr.  Anab. 2.1.4;Curt.  4.8.13),  but  was not  necessarily  a  member  of  the  Corinthian  League (Bosworth  ( 1980)  181).  The  city  was  besieged  and  conquered by  the  Persian  fleet in  333  (Diod. 17.29.2;Arr.  Anab. 2.1.2\u00ad4), but  reconquered  by  the  Makedonians  in  the  following  year (Arr.  Anab. 3.2.6;Curt.  4.5.22). The  constitutional  history  of  Mytilene  bristles  with  revo- lutions  caused  by  discord  between  factions  (stasis)  (Gehrke, Stasis 117\u00ad23;  Spencer  ( 2000)).In  C 7  the  city  was  ruled  by  the house  of  the  Penthelidai,  described  by  Aristotle  as  a    (Pol. 1311b26),which  may  indicate  that Mytilene  originally  was  a  hereditary  kingdom  (Carlier ( 1984)  451;  Sch\u00fctrumpf  and  Gehrke  ( 1996)  561).  Because  of their  tyrannical  behaviour,  they  were  overturned  by  a  cer- tain  Megakles;  but  later  in  the  century  Mytilene  was  once again  ruled  by  a  member  of  the  family,  Penthilos,  who  was murdered by Smerdes  (Pol. 1311b27\u00ad30;  Alc.  fr. 75).  His  son- in-law  was  Pittakos  (Diog.  Laert  1.81;  Alc.  fr. 70),  who  at some  point  ruled  Mytilene  together  with  Myrsilos  (Alc.  fr. 70.7;Strabo 12.2.3).  A  faction  led  by  Alkaios  and  his  two brothers  made  an  abortive  attempt  to  overthrow  Myrsilos, and  Alkaios  had  to  go  into  exile  to  Pyrrha  (P  Berol. 9569). Myrsilos  died  (Alc.  fr. 332),  and  after  a  period  of  civil  war (Alc.  fr. 70.11)  Pittakos  was  elected  aisymnetes  by  the Mytilenaians;  according  to  Alkaios  (fr. 348),however,he  was elected  tyrannos  (Arist.  Pol. 1285a35\u00adb1).  Pittakos  was  later remembered  as  having  given  the  Mytilenaians  new  laws (nomoi),  but  not  a  new  constitution  (politeia)  (Arist.  Pol. 1274b18\u00ad23).Under  his  rule  the  basileis  are  attested  as  a  board of  officials ( Theophr.  fr. 650).  According  to  Apollodoros ((FGrHist 244)  fr. 27),  Pittakos  was  elected  c. 600  and  held power  for  ten  years  and  then  resigned  his  post (Schachermeyr  ( 1950)  1865\u00ad67  (stasis), 1868\u00ad70  (aisym- netes), 1870\u00ad72  (chronology)).  Thereafter  Mytilene  was lesbos  1027 probably  an  oligarchy,  but  in  c. 512  a  new  tyrant,  Koes,  was installed  by  Dareios  as  tyrant  of  Mytilene  (Hdt. 5.11).  At  the beginning  of  the  Ionian  Revolt  he  was  handed  over  to  the Mytilenaian  people  and  stoned  to  death  (Hdt. 5.37\u00ad38). In 428  Mytilene  was  an  oligarchy  (Thuc. 3.39.6),  appar- ently  with  a  ruling  class  of  more  than  1,000  citizens  (Thuc. 3.50.1).  One  of  the  factors  behind  the  defection  from  Athens seems  to have been  a  dispute  about  succession  to property among  some  of  the  euporoi  (Arist.  Pol. 1304a4\u00ad10),and  when the  dynatoi  issued  the  demos  with  hoplite  equipment,  the commoners  opposed  the  government  and  forced  the  sur- render  (Thuc. 3.27.3;  Gillis  ( 1971)). In  the  years  after  405  Mytilene  was  probably  ruled  by  a Spartan  harmost  and  a  Board  of  Ten  (Xen.  Hell. 2.2.5;  Paus. 8.52.4),  but  in  390/89,  when  they  and  their  Mytilenaian  sup- porters  were  expelled  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.28\u00ad29),  Mytilene  seems to  have  become  a  democracy  (IG xii.24.3  (C 4m),  see  infra; IG ii\u00b2  107;Gehrke,  Stasis 121).  By  353/2,  however,  the  democ- racy  had  been  abolished  (Dem. 13.8)  and  replaced  with  an oligarchy  (Dem. 15.19;  Isoc.  Ep. 8).  Shortly  afterwards Mytilene  was  ruled  by  a  tyrant,  Kammys  (Dem. 40.37;Brun ( 1988)  381\u00ad82),  but  he  was  already  deposed  in  347/6  (IG ii\u00b2 213).  When  the  Persians  had  conquered  Mytilene  in  333,one of  the  exiles,  Diogenes,  was  set  up  as  tyrant  of  Mytilene  (Arr. Anab. 2.1.5),  but  in  the  following  year  democracy  was restored  and  a  group  of  exiles  readmitted  to  Mytilene  (SEG 36  750.3: \u00b5;  SEG 36  752  IG xii.26;  cf.  Heisserer ( 1980)  118\u00ad41;  SEG 40  673). Under  democracy  decrees  ( \u00b5) were passed by the  council  ( ) and the people (\u00b5) in accordance with  a  probouleumatic  procedure  (IG xii.25  suppl.;  SEG 36  750,  752;  cf.  Rhodes,  DGS 256\u00ad58).  The  eponymous  offi- cial  was  a  prytanis  (SEG 36  750.18;  Theophr.  fr. 650),  and  a prytaneion  is  mentioned  in  a  paraphrase  of  Sappho's  poems (Ath. 425A);  cf. at  P  Oxy. 3711.fr.  1.  col. 1.4,a late commentary  on  Alkaios.  Other  magistrates  were  boards  of kings  ( ),  generals  ( ) and some called \u00b5  and (IG xii.26.6\u00ad14).  A  treasurer ( \u00b5) is also attested (IG  xii.25.17),  and  we  know  from Ant. 5.77  that  some  of  the  public  expenditure  was  defrayed through  liturgies.  The  Mytilenaians  sent  envoys  to  Olympia (Thuc. 3.9\u00ad14)  and  to  Athens  (IG ii\u00b2  107.21\u00ad22)  and  received envoys  from  Athens  (IG ii\u00b2  107.31\u00ad34).  Mytilene  granted proxenia  to  citizens  of  Magnesia  on  the  Maeander  (SEG 26 909  (C 4l))  and  to  a  citizen  of  an  unknown  polis  (IG xii.25.5 suppl.  (C 4s)).  Mytilenaian  citizens  received  proxenia from  Athens  (Dem. 40.36;  Arist.  Pol. 1304a9\u00ad10)  and  Delphi (F.Delphes iii.4400  (C 4l/C3e)). Apart  from  one  Olympic  victor  in  476  (P  Oxy. 222.i.7; Olympionikai 209),  the  only  known  Mytilenaian  victor  in Panhellenic  games  was  a  periodonike  who  was  active c. 300 and,  thus,  is  too  late  for  our  investigation  (IvO 173;  Paus. 6.15.1). The  city  occupied  an  offshore  island  and  the  adjacent mainland  from  C 10,  probably  focused  around  what  later became  known  as  the  city's  \"North  Harbour\"at  Epano  Skala (Spencer  ( 1995a)  no. 27,(1995b)  fig. 3a);  settlement  activity of  the  third  millennium  has  been  found  on  the  Classical acropolis  of  Mytilene  (Lambrianides  and  Spencer  ( 1997) 86\u00ad87  and  fig. 5),  and  another  settlement  of  the  same  date has  been  found  on  the  coast  just  south  of  the  Classical  city. Sporadic  Mycenaean  sherds  have  been  reported  in  the  area of  the  modern  town,  where  there  are  also  finds of  the Protogeometric,  Geometric  and  Archaic  periods  (Spencer ( 1995b)  279\u00ad81  and  fig. 3,(2000)  74\u00ad75  fig. 4.5).  However, most  of  the  surviving  ancient  remains  are  Hellenistic  and later.  Unpublished  excavations  in  the  early  1980s  have revealed  at  least  one  of  the  stone  bridges  over  the  interven- ing  channel  (silted  up  in  mediaeval  times)  mentioned  by Longus  (Daphnis  and  Chloe 1);  it  is  probably  Roman  in  date. According  to  Vitruvius  ( 1.6.1),  the  town  was  laid  out  on  a grid  plan,  but  poorly  orientated  to  the  prevailing  winds; some  evidence  of  the  orthogonal  plan  survives  in  the  align- ment  of  various  structures  excavated  throughout  the  city. Archaeological  excavations  began  in  a  modest  way  in  the late  nineteenth  century  with  the  work  of  Robert  Koldewey and  his  colleagues  at  Mytilene  and  elsewhere  on  the  island (Koldewey ( 1890)),  but  apart  from  the  theatre,  whose  date  is uncertain,  large-scale  work  did  not  begin  until  the  1960s, and  even  then  involved  mostly  salvage  excavations,  rarely published  in  any  detail  and  only  occasionally  touching  on Archaic  and  Classical  levels.  Later  Roman,  mediaeval  and Ottoman  buildings  destroyed  or  covered  most  earlier remains  and  only  occasionally  is  a  \"window\"  possible  back to  the  city's  early  history.  Several  Greek  publications  sum- marise  much  of  what  was  known  about  Mytilene  up  to  the early 1970s  (Kontes  ( 1973),  ( 1978));  for  a  complete  collection of  all  relevant  references,  see  Spencer  ( 1995b)  no. 27),  and recent  excavations  by  the  Canadian  Archaeological  Institute at  Athens  and  K'  Ephoreia  of  the  Greek  Archaeological Service  have  added  substantially  to  our  knowledge  of certain  areas  (H.  Williams  ( 1984);  Williams  and  Williams ( 1985),  ( 1986),  ( 1987),  ( 1988),  ( 1989),  ( 1990),  ( 1991); Archontidhou  ( 1986\u00ad95)). Possibly  Archaic,  certainly  Classical  and  Late  Classical sections  of  fortifications have been uncovered in different 1028 hansen,  spencer  and  williams areas  of  the  city,  especially  on  the  north-western  side  where they  are  still  well  preserved  and  seem  to  be  of  late  Lesbian- style  masonry  (Koldewey  ( 1890)  pls. 1,  2,  5,  6;  Kontes  ( 1978) figs. 35,  39;  Mason  ( 2001)).  It  is  probable  that  the  city expanded  from  its  original  focus  around  the  north  harbour further  west  on  to  the  mainland  in  C 5,  perhaps  just  before the  revolt  of 428  (Diod. 13.79;  Thuc. 3.2.1).  A  relatively  well- preserved  stretch  some  50  m  long  was  uncovered  near  the north  harbour  and  seems  to  date  from  C 4m;  it  probably defended  the  island  portion  of  the  city  (Williams  and Williams  ( 1991)  180  fig. 2).  Some  100  m  to  the  north-west, excavations  in  1999\u00ad2000  uncovered  an  apparently  match- ing  wall  defending  the  mainland  side  of  the  city  east  of  the modern  IKA  building.  A  33  m  stretch  of  probably  C 4  fortifi- cation  wall  was  uncovered  in  1973  near  the  public  swimming pool  at  the  edge  of  the  modern  south  harbour  (Khatzi  ( 1973) 509\u00ad10).  Smaller  sections  of  city  walls  have  been  found, mostly  on  the  north  and  south  sides  of  town,  in  various  sal- vage  excavations,  and  seem  to  be  late  Classical  in  date. According  to Koldewey ( 1890)  pls. 11\u00ad12  the  walls  enclosed an  area  of 140  ha.  In  connection  with  the  revolt  in  428 Thucydides  reports  that  walls  were  being  constructed  ( 3.2.2, 5).  The  city  was  besieged  by  the  Athenians  in  428  ( 3.18.4\u00ad5), and  the  walls  were  demolished  after  the  conquest  in  427 ( 3.50.1);  however,  walls  are  attested  in  406  by Xen.  Hell. 1.6.17 ( ) and in 333  by Diod. 17.29.2. Mytilene  had  two  harbours  (Thuc. 3.6.1;  Ps.-Skylax 97; Strabo  13.2.2).  Strabo  says  that  the  south  harbour  of  the  city housed  Mytilene's  triremes,  but  the  modern  harbour  works have  obliterated  any  remains;  the  east  and  west  moles  of  the commercial  north  harbour  (supra),  however,  survive  just below  modern  sea  level.  Probably  Roman  in  their  present form,  they  may  well  go  back  to  at  least  the  Classical  period, and  as  noted  above,  this  harbour  appears  to  have  been  the  focus  of  the  earliest  post-prehistoric  settlement. Immediately  adjacent  to  the  south  side  of  the  north  harbour are  the  remains  of  a  long  substantial  stoa  of  C 4  or  C 3,known since  the  1920s  but  not  completely  excavated  until  2000\u00ad1 (Coulton  ( 1977)).  A  long  stretch  of  a  well-built  C 4  aqueduct has  also  been  uncovered  (Khatzi  ( 1972),  ( 1973))  on  the  south side  of  town.  The  theatre (TGR  ii. 252)  on  the  sloping  hill- sides  to  the  west  of  the  town  has  been  excavated  on  several occasions,  but  only  brief  preliminary  reports  have  appeared; it  is  probably  late  Classical  or  early  Hellenistic  in  date (Evangelidis  ( 1927);  cf.  Plut.  Pomp. 42.9  (rC 4m)). Remains  of  at  least  three  Archaic/Late  Classical  sanctuar- ies  have  been  found  in  different  areas  of  the  city.  A  C 7  sanc- tuary,  possibly  to  Kybele  (a  crude  small  statue  of  the  goddess appeared  in  the  excavations  along  with  much  Archaic  buc- chero),  with  an  apsidal  building  in  Lesbian-style  masonry appeared  during  building  operations  behind  the  former insane  asylum  near  the  north  harbour;  it  has  been  published only  in  a  brief  preliminary  form  (Khatzi  ( 1973)  515\u00ad17  fig. 10; Spencer  ( 1995b)  296\u00ad99  fig. 11).  A  Late  Classical/Hellenistic sanctuary  to  Demeter  and  Kore  and  Kybele  has  been  exca- vated  on  the  acropolis  inside  the  mediaeval  castle;  it  consist- ed  of  a  series  of  at  least  five altars in a r ow  north\u00adsouth  with a  rectangular  two-room  building  behind  and  two  semicir- cular  ashpits  for  burned  remains  of  piglets  (Williams  and Williams  ( 1991)).  A  sanctuary  to  Aphrodite  was  uncovered during  building  operations  on  the  south  slopes  of  the  acrop- olis  (Archontidhou  ( 1986\u00ad95))  and  there  is  some  evidence for  a  sanctuary  of  Asklepios  near  the  west  side  of  the  south harbour  (Khatzio).  The  sanctuary  of  Apollo  Maloies  near the  north  harbour  is  still  elusive  (Thuc. 3.3.3).  For  a  general account  of  local  cults  based  mostly  on  literary  and  epi- graphic  evidence,  see  Shields  ( 1917).  A  cult  of  Zeus Homonoios  and  Homonoia  was  invoked  in  connection with  the  restoration  of  the  democracy  in  332  (SEG 36 750.7\u00ad8;  cf.  Th\u00e9riault  ( 1996)  19\u00ad29).  Cults  of  the  Twelve Gods,  of  Zeus  Basileus  and  Zeus  Heraios  were  also  invoked. At  least  some  C 6  graves  seem  to  have  been  found  in  what became  the  expanded  C 5  city  (Kontes  ( 1978)  216;Spencer ( 1995b)  295).  Extensive  late  Classical/early  Hellenistic  ceme- teries  have  been  found  north  and  south  of  the  city,  although there  have only  been  short  preliminary  publications  of  them to  date.  Graves  varied  from  simple  interments  cut  in  the bedrock  to  tile-covered,  to  stone-lined  cists,  to  limestone sarcophagi,  some  in  funerary  precincts  surrounded  by  a  wall (Khatzi  ( 1972),  ( 1973);  Spencer  ( 1995b);  autopsy  on  highway north  of  Mytilene  in  2001). Mytilene  struck  coins  of  electrum,  silver,  billon  and bronze  from  C 5f  on.  ( 1)  Electrum,  C 5f/C4s:  hektai  on  the Phokaic  standard,  with  a  great  variety  of  types:  obv.ram's head,  or  lion's  head,  or  Apollo  laureate,  or  young  Dionysos, etc.;  rev.  panther,  or  sphinx,  or  Persephone,  etc.,  all  in  incuse square;  legend  (on  one  coin  only): .  In  C 5s  Phokaia and  Mytilene  concluded  a  treaty  that  the  two  poleis  should take  turns  and  strike  identical  electrum  coins  in  alternating years  (IG xii.21  SEG 34  849).  ( 2)  Billon,  c. 480\u00ad450,  on  the Phoenician  and  Persic  standard:  denominations:  fractions of  stater  down to a  twenty-fourth,  with  a  variety  of  types: obv.  head  of  calf,  or  lion,  or  Negro,  etc.;  rev.  incuse  square, sometimes  with  eye,  or  amphora,  etc.;  legend:  on  a  few   or or .(3) Silver,  C 5f/C4s:  denominations:  stater, drachm,  hemidrachm,  diobol,  trihemiobol,  obol;  types:  obv. lesbos  1029 head  of  Apollo  or  of  Nymph  Mytilene;  rev.  various  types: head  of  nymph  Mytilene,  or  goat's  head,  or  lyre,  etc.;  legend: ,once  .(4) Br onze,  C 4:  types:  obv.

Mytilene  colonised  Achilleion  in  Troas  (no. 766)  (Strabo 13.1.39),  Sigeion  in  Troas  (no. 791)  (Hdt. 5.94.1),  Ainos  in Thrace  (no. 641)  (Ephor.  fr. 39),  and  Hermonassa  in  the Pontic  region  (no. 697)  (Arr.  Bith.fr. 55  (FGrHist 156)  fr. 71). In  addition  to  its  hinterland,  Mytilene  possessed  a  size- able  peraia  in  Troas  and  northern  Aiolis  (Strabo  13.1.38;Livy 37.21.4),  although  at  what  date  all  parts  of  this  peraia  were acquired,  and  whether  all  were  simultaneously  held,  is  not clear.  The  terminus  ante  quem  for  Mytilene's acquisition  of at  least  part  of  its  peraia  is  the  dispute  between  Mytilene  and Athens  over  Sigeion  in  C 7l\u00adC6e  (Hdt. 5.95.2;Strabo 13.1.38; Diog.  Laert. 1.74).  The  precise  extent  of  the  peraia  is unknown,  but  it  included  the  so-called  Aktaiai  poleis  (Thuc. 4.52.2\u00ad3):  i.e.  Achilleion  (no. 766),  Antandros  (no. 767), Hamaxitos  (no. 778),  Larisa  (no. 784),  Ophryneion  (no. 786),  Ilion  (no. 779),  Pordoselene  (no. 831),  Rhoiteion  (no. 790),  plus  some  others  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.122\u00ad40,  77.iv.14\u00ad27;see Hansen  ( 1997)  32).  Mytilene  had  to  surrender  its  peraia  to Athens  in  427  (Thuc. 3.50.3).  Some  of  the  Aktaiai  poleis  were reconquered  in 424  by  exiled  Mytilenaians  (Thuc. 4.52.3), but  at  least  Antandros  was  lost  again  soon  after  (Thuc. 4.75.1).  By  C 4m  Mytilene  had  recovered  part  of  its  peraia  in the  Gulf  of  Adramytteion  (Ps.-Skylax  98),and  had  it  extend- ed  by  a  gift  from  Alexander  in  331  (Curt. 4.8.13).

Pyrrha  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban sense  at  Ps.-Skylax  97  (cf.  Hdt. 1.151.2),  and  at  Thuc. 3.18.1 polis  is  used  about  Pyrrha  in  the  urban  and  political  senses simultaneously.  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  internally  in  abbreviated  form  on  coins  (infra)  and externally  in  inscriptions  (IG ii\u00b2  107.29  ( 368/7))  and  in  liter- ature  (Arist.  Hist.  an. 548a10).  The  individual  and  external use  is  attested  in  a  Delphic  proxeny  decree  for  \u00b5    (BCH  ( 1940/1)  94.4  ( 330/29)).  Pyrrha  is implicitly  called  patris  in  Xen.  Hell. 4.8.28. The  territory  of  Pyrrha  seems  to  have  comprised  the south  coast  of  the  Gulf  of  Kalloni,  in  the  sources  called     (Arist.  Part.  an. 680a36\u00adb1)  as  well  as  the region  south  of  the  Gulf.  It may  have covered  c. 250  km \u00b2 (Kontes  ( 1978)  figs. 19\u00ad22).  Pyrrha  bordered  on  Methymna to  the  north,  near  Messon.  To the  east  Pyrrha  bordered  on Mytilene  and  was  separated  from  this  polis  by  the  \"pine- covered  Pyrrhaian  mountain\"  (Theophr.  Hist.  pl. 3.9.5)  on the  slopes  of  Mt.  Olympos  (see  no. 798  supra). The  only  thing  we  learn  about  the  history  of  Pyrrha  in  the Archaic  period  is  that  Alkaios  found  shelter  in  the  city  when he  had  been  exiled  from  Mytilene  (P  Berol. 9569). The  Pyrrhaians  were  members  of  the  Delian  League.  They are  unattested  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists,  which  shows  that, like  the  other  Lesbian  poleis,  the  Pyrrhaians  provided  ships instead  of  paying  phoros  (Thuc. 1.116.2,  117.2).  In  428  they joined  the  Mytilenaians  in  defecting  from  Athens  (Thuc. 3.2.1, 25.1).They  were  involved  in  the  Mytilenaian  attempt  to  synoe- cise  Lesbos,  and  before  the  Athenian  siege  of  Mytilene  began, the  Mytilenaians  secured  their  position  in  Antissa,  Pyrrha  and Eresos  and  reinforced  the  fortifications of  the  three  cities ( 3.18.1).  The  Athenians  gained  possession  of  Pyrrha  and Eresos  only  after  Mytilene's  surrender  in  427  ( 3.35.1),  and  the territory,  or  at  least  a  part  of  it,  was  surrendered  to  Athenian klerouchs  ( 3.50.2).

The  toponym  is , (Hdt. 1.151.2)  or,  in  the  Attic-Ionic  dialect, (Steph. Byz. 3,  8\u00ad9).  Arisba  is  described  by  Herodotos  as  the  sixth polis  on  Lesbos,  where  polis  is  used  in  the  urban  and  the political  senses  simultaneously.  Before  C 5m  and  probably in  C 6,  the  city  was  conquered  by  Methymna;  its  population was  exposed  to  andrapodismos  (Hdt. 1.151.2);  and  the  terri- tory  was  incorporated  into  that  of  Methymna  (Strabo 13.1.21). The  site  of  Arisba  is  probably  to  be  identified w ith  the ancient  remains  on  the  low  acropolis  of  \"Palaeokastro\"  near the  modern  village  of  that  name  near  Kalloni,  and  has  been known  since  the  nineteenth  century.  There  are  extensive traces  of  a  polygonal  masonry  fortification wall around the acropolis,  and  along  the  northern  side  of  the  plateau.  As reconstructed  by Koldewey ( 1890)  pl. 13,  the  walls  may  have enclosed  an  area  of  c. 8  ha.  There  are  remains  of  megaron- like  houses  on  the  hill,  but  the  precise  dating  of  both  walls and  houses  is  unclear  and  could  not  be  clarified e ven through  excavation  by  the  local  archaeological  ephoreia.

Eresos  is  implicitly  called  patris  in Xen.  Hell. 4.8.28. The  territory of  Eresos  probably  covered  c. 225  km \u00b2. Already  in  the  Archaic  period  it  was  marked  by  a  line  of installations  in  Lesbian  masonry  (Schaus  and  Spencer ( 1994)  414\u00ad20),  of  which  five have been identified:  Spilios (Spencer  ( 1995a)  no. 141),  Megalos  Lakkos  (ibid.  no. 175), Bigla  tou  Aetou  (ibid.no. 187,  some  8  km  west  of  the  Gulf  of Kalloni,  but  in  Barr.  placed  near  the  coast),  Apotheke  (ibid. no. 130)  and  Makara  (ibid.  no. 131).  To  the  north  it  may  have included  Sigrion  (although  there  are  no  remains  antedating the  Roman  period  known  at  this  site,  supra).  The  frontier towards  Antissa  was  probably  the  high  upland  area  includ- ing  Mount  Ordymnos  between  the  two  poleis  (see  the description  of  the  territory  of  Antissa,  supra).  Along  the north  coast  of  the  Gulf  of  Kalloni  the  frontier  lay  north  of Apotheke  (infra)  but  presumably  south  of  what  appears  to be  a  fort  at  Issa  (supra):  Labarre  ( 1996)  199. The  Eresians  were  members  of  the  Delian  League.  They are  unattested  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists,  which  shows that,  like  the  other  Lesbian  poleis,  the  Eresians  provided ships  instead  of  paying  phoros  (Thuc. 1.116.2,  117.2).  In  428 they  joined  the  Mytilenaians  in  defecting  from  Athens (Thuc. 3.2.1).They  were  involved  in  the  Mytilenaian  attempt to  synoecise  Lesbos,  and  before  the  Athenian  siege  of Mytilene  began,  the  Mytilenaians  secured  their  position  in Antissa,  Pyrrha  and  Eresos  and  reinforced  the  fortifications of  the  three  cities  ( 3.18.1).  The  Athenians  gained  possession of  Pyrrha  and  Eresos  only  after  Mytilene's surrender  in  427 ( 3.35.1),  and  the  territory,  or  at  least  a  part  of  it,  was  surren- dered  to Athenian  klerouchs  ( 3.50.2).Eresos  revolted  against Athens  once  again  in  412  ( 8.23.4),  but  was  soon  recaptured by  the  Athenians  ( 8.23.5).  In  411,  however,  exiled Methymnian  oligarchs  provoked  a  new  defection  ( 8.100.3), and  this  time  Eresos  withstood  the  Athenians'  attempt  to take  the  city  by  siege  ( 8.100.4\u00ad5,  101.1,  103.2). In C 4e  Eresos  was  allied  with  Lakedaimon,  but  in  390/89 Thrasyboulos  imposed  a  settlement  by  which  the  city  joined the  Athenians  (Diod. 14.94.4).  The  settlement  undoubtedly included  the  repatriation  of  some  exiles  to Mytilene  (Xen. Hell. 4.8.28).  Eresos  was  a  member  of  the  Second  Athenian Naval  League,  but,  by  contrast  with  Mytilene,  it  was  not among  the  founding  members.  It  joined  the  alliance  in, probably, 375  (IG ii\u00b2  43B.21;  Brun  ( 1988)  377),  and  Eresian representatives  in  the  allied  synedrion  are  attested  for  the year 368/7  (IG ii\u00b2  107.29). Eresos  joined  the  Corinthian  League,  probably  in  337,and was  then  a  tyranny  (Dem. 17.7;  Bosworth  ( 1980)  179)  ruled by  Hermon,  Heraios  and  Apollodoros  (IG xii.2526D.18\u00ad21; Lott  ( 1996)),  but  in  333  the  city  was  taken  by  the  Persian admiral  Memnon  (Diod. 17.29.2;Arr.  Anab. 2.1.1),  and  other tyrants  were  installed;  viz.  Agonippos  (IG xii.2526A.1\u00ad32, D 12)  and  Eurysilaos  (IG xii.2526B.1\u00ad33,D12).  The Makedonians  reconquered  Lesbos  in  the  following  year (Arr.  Anab. 3.2.6)  and  deposed  the  tyrants  (Dem. 17.7).  They were  handed  over  to  the  Eresians,  who  had  them  sentenced to  death  and  executed  (IG xii.2526,see infra). Almost  all  we  know  about  the  political  organisation  of Eresos  stems  from  a  dossier  of  documents,  all  related  to  tri- als  against  ( 1)  the  tyrants  Agonippos  and  Eurysilaos,  and  ( 2) the  descendants  of  the  former  tyrants  (IG xii.2526  Rec. Inscr.  Jur.  Gr. 27  Tod 191  Heisserer  ( 1980)  27\u00ad78;  cf.  the analysis  in  Koch ( 2001)).  One  decree  reports  the  trial  and conviction  of  Agonippos  (A. 1\u00ad32),  another  the  trial  and conviction  of  Eurysilaos  (B. 1\u00ad34),  a  third  one  the  trial  of  the descendants  of  the  former  tyrants  (A. 33\u00ad41,C.1\u00ad20),  fol- lowed  by  letters  from  Philip  Arrhidaios  and  Antigonos (C. 21\u00adD.3)  and,  finally,  a  C 4l  decree  of  the  Eresian  people confirming all former v erdicts  (D. 4\u00ad39). Eresos  was  probably  a  democracy  when  the  trials  of  the tyrants  were  heard.  A  prytanis  served  as  the  eponymous  offi- cial  ( ,C.29;  cf.  the  list  of  ' drawn  up  by  Phanias,  the  C 4s  pupil  of  Aristotle  (frr. 17\u00ad19, Wehrli)).  Decrees  ( \u00b5,D.33\u00ad34) were passed in a general  assembly  ( ,A.26) by the people (\u00b5, A. 33,  41)  or  by  the  council  ( ,C.31,D.4) and the people  in  accordance  with  a  probouleumatic  procedure ([ ][],  D. 4).  It  was  the  people  ( \u00b5) who in both  cases  decided  to  appoint  a  court  ( ,D.13\u00ad15, 24)  to  hear  the  trial  of  the  tyrants,  and  speakers  for  the  prose- lesbos  1023 cution  ( ,C.28\u00ad34) were appointed by the polis (C. 30).  It  is  unknown  whether  the  dikasterion  was  coextensive with  the  ekklesia.  The  trials  were  warranted  by  a  law  against tyrants  and  their  descendants  (A. 24\u00ad26,D.16\u00ad17,31\u00ad32).At  the trial  Agonippos  was  found  guilty  and  sentenced  to  death  by 876  votes  to  7  (A. 30\u00ad32);  Eurysilaos  was  sentenced  to  death  too (D. 14\u00ad15),  and  at  the  trial  of  the  descendants  of  the  former tyrants  the  Eresians  confirmed the earlier sentence of  exile (C. 22\u00ad28).  The  number  of  votes  cast,  altogether  883,  points  to a  total  of  at  least  1,000  adult  male  citizens  and  a  population  of at  least  4,000  citizens  plus  foreigners  and  slaves. Eresos  sent  envoys  to  Alexander  the  Great  c. 332  (IG xii.2 526A.33)  and  received  envoys  from  Athens  in  368/7  (IG ii\u00b2 107.31\u00ad34). Eresian  citizens  received  proxenia  from  Delphi  (F.Delphes iii.4  395  (c. 360\u00ad320)),  Megara  (IG vii  4  (C 4l))  and  Zeleia (Michel  531  (C 4)). Only  limited  excavations  and  surveys  have  taken  place  on the  site  of  Lesbos'  westernmost  polis,  and  discoveries  have been  mainly  Roman  or  early  Christian  in  date  (Koldewey ( 1890)  pls. 8,  9;  Kontes  ( 1978)  figs. 56,  57;  Schaus  and  Spencer ( 1994);  references  to  finds at the site are c ollected  in  Spencer ( 1995a)  no. 135,(1995b)  288  and  fig. 8).  Some  remains  of  a fortification wall in L esbian-style  masonry,  probably Archaic,  survive  on  the  acropolis  (Koldewey  ( 1890)  pl. 9).As reconstructed  by Koldewey ( 1890)  pl. 6,  the  walls  enclosed an  area  of  c. 5  ha.  An  Archaic  Aiolic  capital  (probably  either from  a  votive  column  or  temple)  was  dredged  up  out  of  the harbour  and  is  now  in  the  museum  at  Mytilene  (Spencer ( 1995a)  no. 135  and  n. 61  (p. 30);Archontidhou  ( 1999)  28).An Archaic  relief  of  a  seated  Kybele  in  naiskos  from  the  site  sug- gests  a  sanctuary  (Spencer  ( 1995a)  no. 138;  Archontidhou ( 1999)  93).  At  the  site  of  Apotheke  near  the  entrance  to  the Gulf  of  Kalloni  stands  the  best-preserved  structure  in Lesbian-style  masonry  on  the  island,  a  large  Late  Archaic temple  platform  (Koldewey  ( 1890)  pl. 15;  Schaus  and Spencer  ( 1994)  416\u00ad17  and  fig. 3;  Spencer  ( 1995a)  no. 130, ( 2000)  72).  We  know  from  Thucydides  that  Eresos  was walled  in  428/7,that  the  fortifications w ere  reinforced  in  that year  ( 3.18.1),and  that  the  city  was  besieged  in  412  ( 8.100.4\u00ad5).

", "Pyrrha": "Identifier: 1031, followed  Chios  and  Mytilene and  seceded  from  Athens  once  again  (Thuc. 8.23.2).  It  was recovered by Athens  soon  after  ( 8.23.6),  but  Pyrrha  was  allied with  Sparta  once  again  in  406  (Diod. 13.100.5). In C 4e  Pyrrha  was  allied  with  Lakedaimon,  but  in  390/89 Thrasyboulos  seems  to  have  forced  the  city  to  join  the Athenians  (Diod. 14.94.3\u00ad4;Lys.  fr. 119,  Sauppe).  The  settle- ment  undoubtedly  included  the  repatriation  of  some  exiles to  Mytilene  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.28).  Pyrrha  was  a  member  of  the Second  Athenian  Naval  League.  In  the  list  of  members appended  to  the  so-called  Charter  of  the  League,  Pyrrha  is restored  either  in  line  90: [] or in B1:[] [ ]  \u00b5  (Dreher  ( 1995)  198  n. 105;  cf.  SEG 38  55).  In  any case,  Pyrrha  joined  the  League  after  Mytilene  and Methymna  ( 80\u00ad81),  but  before  Antissa  and  Eresos (B. 20\u00ad21).  Pyrrhaian  representatives  in  the  allied  synedrion are  attested  for  the  year  368/7  (IG ii\u00b2  107.29). In C 4f  Menedemos  of  Pyrrha,  a  member  of  Plato's Academy  (Philoch.  fr. 224;  Epikrates  fr. 10,  PCG),  was  sent back  to  his  mother  city  to  advise  the  Pyrrhaians  about  their constitution  (Plut.  Mor. 1126C).  In  330/29  he  became  prox- enos  of  Delphi  (BCH  ( 1940/1)  94.4). In 333  Pyrrha  was  taken  by  the  Persian  admiral  Memnon alongside  the  other  Lesbian  poleis  (Diod. 17.29.2;Arr.  Anab. 1030 hansen,  spencer  and  williams 2.1.1),  but  by  a  peaceful  agreement  the  Makedonians regained  the  small  cities  on  Lesbos  in  the  following  year (Arr.  Anab. 3.2.6). The  acropolis  and  possibly  the  lower  town exhibit  traces of  settlement,  fortification walls and t ombs  dating  from  the end  of  C 10  (Koldewey ( 1890)  pl. 11;  Kontes  ( 1978)  fig. 60; Paraskevaidis  ( 1963);  Spencer  ( 1995a)  no. 99,(1995b)  281\u00ad83, fig. 4).  As  reconstructed  by  Koldewey  ( 1890)  7\u00ad28  and  pl. 11, the  walls  enclosed  an  area  of 9.5  ha.  Small-scale  excavations nearly  a  hundred  years  ago  carried  out  by  Bohlau  at  Pyrrha uncovered  a  C 8  apsidal  building,  probably  a  sanctuary (Schiering  ( 1989)),  and  salvage  excavations  have  opened numerous  late  Classical/Hellenistic  graves  (Kontes  ( 1973); Archontidhou  ( 1999)  74\u00ad75  for  finds);  rising  sea  levels  have covered  some  buildings  by the  shore,  including  several  iden- tified as ship sheds of  unknown  date.  The  date  of  the  large pseudodipteral  Ionic  temple  at  the  Hellenistic  pan-Lesbian site  of  Messon  near  the  head  of  the  Gulf  of  Kalloni  in  a marsh  is  debated,  but  is  probably  late  Classical/early Hellenistic  (Koldewey  ( 1890)  pls. 18\u00ad20;  Petrakos  ( 1967); Plommer  ( 1981)  suggests  C 5\u00adC4;  Pfrommer  ( 1989)  suggests first half  of  C 3  on  the  basis  of  architectural  decor).  After Pyrrha's destruction,  probably  by the  earthquake  of 231,  the site  became  part  of  Mytilene's  territory.  Recent  work, including  drilled  cores  by  the  Archaeological  Service,  is  in the  course  of  publication.  A  sanctuary  at  the  south-west  tip of  Lesbos,  Cape  Phokas,  perhaps  of  Archaic  date,  possibly  to Dionysos  or  to Hera,  etc.  (Quinn  ( 1961))  is  known  from  lim- ited  excavations  (Spencer  ( 1995a)  no. 74).  We know  from Thuc. 3.18.1  that  Pyrrha  was  walled  in  428/7,and  that  the  for- tifications w ere  reinforced  in  that  year.  The  harbour  is  men- tioned  by Ps.-Skylax  97. Pyrrha  struck  bronze  coins  in  C 4,  perhaps  starting  c. 370.

Antissa  is  called  a  polis  both  in the  urban  sense  (Ps.-Skylax  97;  cf.  Hdt. 1.151.2)  and  in  the political  sense  (Arist.  Oec. 1347a25).  At Thuc. 3.18.1  polis  is found  in  both  senses  simultaneously.  The  collective  and external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  inscriptions  (IG ii\u00b2  107.29  ( 368/7))  and  in  literature  (Arist.  Pol. 1303a34).  For the  individual  and  external  use,  see   at  Arist.  Oec. 1347a25.Antissa  is  implicitly  called patris  in  Xen.  Hell. 4.8.28. The  territory  of  Antissa  covered  c. 250  km \u00b2.  To  the  south  its neighbouring  polis  was  Eresos,  and  their  frontier  was  proba- bly  in  the  high  upland  between  the  two  poleis,  with  sites  such as  the  polygonal  masonry  tower  Kourouklos  (Spencer ( 1995a)  no. 178)  representing  the  border  area.  To  the  north- east  it  bordered  on  Methymna,  and  the  frontier  was  probably between  the  forts  at  Selles  (ibid.  no. 205)  and  Ametelle  (ibid. no. 202),  both  belonging  to  Methymna,  and  the  forts  at lesbos  1021 Koutlougouni  (ibid.  no. 190),  Koja  Dag  (ibid.  no. 193)  and Skoteino  (ibid.  no. 201),all  belonging  to  Antissa.  According  to Kontes  ( 1978)  127\u00ad28,  312\u00ad13,  Antissa  possessed  Issa  and  its territory  reached  the  Gulf  of  Kalloni.  However,  the  upland topography  to  the  south  and  east  of  Antissa  argues  against  the suggestion  that  their  territory  extended  so  far  in  this  direc- tion,  and  Kontes'  views  have  also  been  criticised  by  Labarre ( 1996)  199\u00ad200.  Issa  could  have  belonged  to  Methymna. The  Antissaians  were  members  of  the  Delian  League. They  are  unattested  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  which  show that,  like  the  other  Lesbian  poleis,  the  Antissaians  provided ships  instead  of  paying  phoros  (Thuc. 1.116.2,  117.2).  In  428 they  joined  the  Mytilenaians  in  defecting  from  Athens (Thuc. 3.2.1).They  were  involved  in  the  Mytilenaian  attempt to  synoecise  Lesbos,  and  before  the  Athenian  siege  of Mytilene  began,  the  Mytilenaians  secured  their  position  in Antissa,  Pyrrha  and  Eresos  and  reinforced  the  fortifications of  the  three  cities  ( 3.18.1).  A  Methymnaian  attack  on  Antissa was  repelled  ( 3.18.2).  After  Mytilene's surrender  in  427,  the Athenians  sent  a  squadron  against  Antissa  and  conquered the  city  ( 3.28.3).  The  territory,  or  at  least  a  part  of  it,  was  sur- rendered  to Athenian  klerouchs  ( 3.50.2). In 412  Antissa  seems  to  have  followed  Chios  and  Mytilene and  seceded  from  Athens  once  again  (Thuc. 8.22.2).  In  any case,  the  juxtaposition  at  Thuc. 8.23.4  of  Antissa  and Methymna,  which  had  revolted  against  Athens,  indicates that  Antissa  had  revolted  too,  and  now  sheltered  some  anti- Athenian  exiles  from  Chios  (Diod. 13  65.3;  cf.  Gehrke,  Stasis 23,45);  but  stasis  between  the  two  different  ethnic  groups  led to  civil  war  and  the  forceful  expulsion  of  the  exiles  (Arist. Pol. 1303a25\u00ad28,  34\u00ad35). In C 4e  Antissa  was  allied  with  Lakedaimon,  but  in  390/89 Thrasyboulos  imposed  a  settlement  by  which  the  city  joined the  Athenians  (Diod. 14.94.4).  The  settlement  undoubtedly included  the  repatriation  of  some  exiles  to Mytilene  (Xen. Hell. 4.8.28).  Antissa  was  a  member  of  the  Second  Athenian Naval  League,  but,  by  contrast  with  Mytilene,  it  was  not among  the  founding  members.  It  joined  the  alliance  in, probably, 375  (IG ii\u00b2  43B.20;  Brun  ( 1988)  377),  and Antissaian  representatives  in  the  allied  synedrion  are  attest- ed  for  the  year  368/7  (IG ii\u00b2  107.29). Antissa  joined  the  Corinthian  League,  probably  in  337, and  was  then  ruled  by  a  tyrant  (Dem. 17.7;  Bosworth  ( 1980) 179).  In  333  the  city  was  taken  by  the  Persian  admiral Memnon,  alongside  the  other  Lesbian  poleis  (Diod. 17.29.2; Arr.  Anab. 2.1.1),  but  the  Makedonians  reconquered  Antissa in  the  following  year  (Arr.  Anab. 3.2.6;Curt.  4.5.22)  and deposed  the  tyrant  (Dem. 17.7). At  the  coastal  site  of  Antissa,  on  the  promontory  of Ovriokastro,  are  few  visible  remains  earlier  than  mediaeval, but  in  the  1930s  limited  excavations  revealed Geometric/Archaic  structures  and  graves  on  the  landward side.  The  earlier  of  two  superimposed  apsidal  buildings appears  to  be  of  Geometric  date,  the  later  successor  building dating  to  the  early  Archaic  period  (Lamb  ( 1931\u00ad32)).  The end  of  a  late  Classical  stoa  was  also  uncovered,  and  an Archaic  street;  references  for  all  finds are c ollected  in Spencer  ( 1995a)  no. 161,(1995b)  285\u00ad87.  In  one  of  the  ceme- teries  there  is  evidence  of  a  small  temenos  and  tomb  cult (Spencer  1995d;  for  the  link  of  the  cult  to the  region  of Antissa,  see  Harisis  et al.( 2002a),  ( 2002b).  We know  from Thuc. 3.18.1  that  Antissa  was  walled  in  428/7  and  that  the  for- tifications w ere  reinforced  in  that  year.  There  are  stretches  of a  large-scale  wall  on  the  south  side  of  the  acropolis  recorded by  Lamb  during  fieldwork in the  1930s  (Spencer  ( 1995a) 62\u00ad63),  but  whether  these  were  part  of  a  circuit  wall,  and  its precise  dating,  are  still  unclear.  As  reconstructed  by Koldewey ( 1890)  pl. 6,  the  walls  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 18  ha. One  of  the  so-called  Lesbian  coins  (supra)  has  a  mono- gram  which  has  been  interpreted  as  ,  standing  for Antissa  (Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 1.  349\u00ad50  no. 568). 795.

Hell. 1.6.38; Dem. 44.9).  The  epichoric  form  of  the  city-ethnic  is \u00b5  (coins,  infra),  the  Attic\u00adIonic  form  is \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  353.66  ( 420/19);  Hdt. 1.23.1).  Methymna is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Xen.  Hell. 1.6.13;  Ps.- Skylax 97;  cf.  Hdt. 1.151.2)  and  in  the  political  sense  (IG ii\u00b2 40.23  ( 378/7);  Hdt. 1.151.2,  3;Xen.  Hell. 4.8.28;Isoc.  Ep. 7.9). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  inscriptions  (IG i\u00b3  353.66 ( 420/19))  and  in  literature  (Hdt. 1.151.1;  Thuc. 3.2.3).  For  the individual  and  external  use,  see  \u00b5 (Hdt. 1.23).Methymna  is  implicitly  called  patris  in  Xen.  Hell. 4.8.28. The  territory was  called  \u00b5  (Ant. 5.21)  and may  originally  have  covered  less  than  200  km \u00b2  (Mason ( 1993)  229),  but  after  the  conquest  of  Arisba  probably  meas- ured  more  than  400  km \u00b2.  To  the  west  it  bordered  on  Antissa, and  the  frontier  probably  lay  along  the  forts  at  Selles (Spencer  ( 1995a)  no. 205)  and  Ametelle  (ibid.  no. 202),  both belonging  to  Methymna,  and  the  forts  at  Koutlougouni (ibid.  no. 190),  Koja  Dag  (ibid.  no. 193)  and  Skoteino  (ibid. no. 201),  all  belonging  to  Antissa.  On  the  east  coast  of  Lesbos Methymna  bordered  on  Mytilene,  and  its  territory  may  have included  Aigeiros  (Labarre ( 1996)  194),  although  the  loca- tion  of  the  latter  site  is  still  unclear;  see  the  list  of  non-polis sites  supra.  The  frontier  between  Methymna  and  Mytilene may  have  been  as  far  north  as  Cape  Tsakm\u00e1k  (Mason  ( 1993) 231\u00ad48),  but  this  suggestion  remains  to  be  proved.  Towards the  Gulf  of  Kalloni,  after  the  disappearance  of  Arisba, Methymna  bordered  on  Pyrrha  to the  south-east,  and  the frontier  was  probably  at  Messon,  the  common  shrine  for  all of  Lesbos  (Mason  ( 1993)  231\u00ad32).  Further  to  the  west Methymna's  territory  at  the  Gulf  of  Kalloni  may  have extended  to the  site  of  Issa  and  bordered  on  Eresos  some- where  north  of  Apotheke  (see  supra). The  only  historical  event  antedating  the  Classical  period is  Herodotos'  piece  of  information  that  Methymna  con- quered  Arisba,  the  sixth  polis  on  Lesbos,  and  exposed  its population  to  andrapodismos  (Hdt. 1.151.1,  supra). Methymna  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  The Lesbians  were  among  those  who  in  478  encouraged  the Athenians  to  replace  Sparta  as  the  hegemon  in  the  war against  Persia  (Plut.  Arist. 23.4),  and  the  Methymnians  must have  been  among  the  original  members  of  the  League.  In spite  of  Mytilenaian  collaboration  with  an  anti-Athenian faction  in  Methymna  (Thuc. 3.18.1),  the  Methymnians remained  loyal  to  Athens  when  the  rest  of  Lesbos  revolted  in 428  (Thuc. 3.2.1,  5.1,  50.2),  and  they  maintained  their  status 1024 hansen,  spencer  and  williams as  autonomoi  allies  who,  instead  of  paying  phoros,  took  part in  the  campaigns  with  their  armed  forces  (Thuc. 6.85.2, 7.57.5).  Accordingly,  they  are  not  recorded  in  the  Athenian tribute  lists.  In 412  Methymna  was  the  first L esbian  polis  that revolted  from  Athens  (Thuc. 8.22.2,  23.4),  but  the  city  was soon  recovered  by  the  Athenians  ( 8.23.6,  100.2).  In  411  a group  of  oligarchic  exiles  made  a  vain  attempt  to  win  the city  (Thuc. 8.100.3).  Methymna  remained  in  Athenian hands  (Xen.  Hell. 1.2.12)  until  406,  when  the  city  was betrayed  by  a  pro-Lakedaimonian  faction  to  a Peloponnesian  force  under  Kallikratides  (Xen.  Hell. 1.6.12\u00ad15,  38;Diod.  13.76.5).  The  Methymnaians  were  still allied  with  Sparta  in  390/89  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.28)  when,  sup- ported  by  pro-Athenian  exiles  settled  in  Mytilene, Thrasyboulos  launched  an  attack  on  Methymna.  He  won  a battle  and  ravaged  the  territory  but  could  not  conquer  the city  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.28\u00ad30;Diod.  14.94.4). A  decade  later  Methymna  had  changed  sides.  It  was  one  of the  founding  members  of  the  Second  Athenian  Naval League.  A  separate  treaty  between  Athens  and  Methymna was  concluded  in  the  autumn  of 378  (IG ii\u00b2  42),  and Mytilene  is  listed  among  the  allies  in  the  so-called  Charter  of the  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.81  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 257),  and  their  rep- resentatives  in  the  allied  synedrion  are  attested  for  the  year 368/7  (IG ii\u00b2  107.28).  Methymna  sent  envoys  to Athens  in 378/7  (IG ii\u00b2  40.24\u00ad25),  and  Athens  sent  envoys  to Methymna  (IG ii\u00b2  107.31\u00ad34  ( 368/7)). In 333  Methymna  was  taken  by  the  Persian  admiral Memnon  alongside  the  other  Lesbian  poleis  (Diod. 17.29.2; Arr.  Anab. 2.1.1),  but  by  a  peaceful  agreement  the Makedonians  regained  the  small  cities  on  Lesbos  in  the  fol- lowing  year  (Arr.  Anab. 3.2.6). The  group  of  oligarchic  exiles  attested  in  411  (Thuc. 8.100.3)  may  indicate  that,  at  that  point,  Methymna  was  a democracy;  but  otherwise  next  to  nothing  is  known  about the  type  of  constitution  until  C 4m,  when  it  seems  to  have been  an  oligarchy  (Theopomp.  fr. 227;Gehrke,  Stasis 113). From C 4m  Methymna  was  ruled  by  a  series  of  tyrants  (Berve ( 1967)  337;  Bosworth  ( 1980)  179\u00ad80).  The  first was Kleommis, who  restored  law  and  order  to  Methymna  (Theopomp.  fr. 227,  where  he  is  called  \u00b5),  recalled  the  exiles,  and issued  all  citizens  with  hoplite  weapons  (Isoc.  Ep. 7.8\u00ad9).  He was  loyal  to  Athens  and  was  awarded  proxenia  by  the Athenians  (IG ii\u00b2  284).  He  was  succeeded  by  Aristonymos,  a friend  of  Memnon  (Polyaen.  Strat. 5.44.3).  The  next  tyrant, Aristonikos,  was  deposed  in  332  and,  on  Alexander's  orders, handed  over  to  the  Methymnians,  who  had  him  tortured  and executed  (Arr.  Anab. 3.2.4\u00ad7;Curt.  4.5.19\u00ad21,  8.11). Only  surveys  and  salvage  excavations  have  been  carried out  at  Methymna,  the  second  in  size  of  the  poleis  of  the island;  but  a  comprehensive study  including  a  presentation of  the  remains  visible  up  to  the  1970s  has  appeared (Buchholz  ( 1975);  cf.  Koldewey ( 1890);  Kontes  ( 1978); Spencer  ( 1995a)  no. 217,(1995b)  283\u00ad85  and  fig. 5). The  extent  of  the  ancient  city  with  its  acropolis  (occupied by  a  small  Genoese  castle)  and  harbour  (undated  ancient harbour  works  are  visible  beside  and  under  modern  con- structions)  is  apparent,  and  scattered  finds suggest stages of expansion  from  Archaic  to  Hellenistic.  The  earliest  histor- ical  structural  remains  may  be  those  south  of  the  Kastro, where  an  Archaic  street  and  housing  complex  is  underlain by  earlier  structural  remains  of  Geometric  and  possibly Protogeometric  date  (Spencer  ( 1995b)  283  and  n. 94.  The  no longer  visible  theatre (TGR  ii. 253)  under  the  village  school may  be  C 4  in  date  (Buchholz  ( 1975));  a  second  theatral building  nearby  (bouleuterion  or  odeion?)  is  also  said  to  have once  been  visible  (Dr.  Peter  Green,  pers.  comm.).  Graves  of C 6  and  C 5  have  been  uncovered  to  the  west  and  north  of  the acropolis  (Buchholz  ( 1975)  pl. 10d;  Spencer  ( 1995b); Archontidhou  ( 1999)).  The  site  of  the  largest  Aiolic  temple on  the  island  (probably  to  Apollo)  has  been  known  near  the village  of  Napi  since  the  late  nineteenth  century,  but  no complete  study  has  yet  appeared;  it  probably  dates  to  C 6l (Evangelidis  ( 1926),  ( 1927);  Koldewey ( 1890)  pl. 16; Betancourt  ( 1977);Spencer  ( 1995a)  no. 111,(1995b)  299\u00ad300). A  smaller  structure  of  similar  date  beside  it  has  not  been identified,  but  it  is  probably  a  second  temple  (the  same  refs. as  above).  Recent  new  excavations  ( 1999)  by  the Archaeological  Service  may  reveal  more  precise  informa- tion  once  they  have  been  published.  There  is  also  possible evidence  for  an  Archaic  silver  mine  in  its  south-eastern  ter- ritory  near  the  village  of  Argenna  (Davies  ( 1932)  985).At  var- ious  places  in  the  modern  town  are  remains  of  a  C 6(?) polygonal  city  wall  (Koldewey ( 1890)  pl. 16,  table 4ab;  Lang ( 1996)  247).As  reconstructed  by  Koldewey,  the  area  enclosed by  the  walls  measured  c. 30  ha.  Furthermore,  it  appears  from Thuc. 3.18.1  that  Methymna  was  walled  in  428/7  and  that  the fortifications w ere  reinforced  in  that  year;  a  siege  of  the  city in 406  is  reported  at  Diod. 13.76.5. Methymna  struck  coins  of  electrum  and  silver  from  c. 550 until  c. 375.(1)  Electrum,  c. 550\u00ad375:  hektai  on  the  Phokaic standard.

Either  Assa  and  Assera  are  two  different places,  or  Stephanos  did  not  know  that  Herodotos  and Theopompos  referred  to  the  same  place.  The  city-ethnic  is either  h or ,  both  recorded  in  the Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  266.ii.26  and  IG i\u00b3  270.iii.16). At  Hdt. 7.122  Ass(er)a  is  twice  called  a  polis,  first in the urban  sense,  but  the  information  that  Ass(er)a  was  one  of the  poleis  which  supplied  Xerxes  with  troops  in  480  indicates that  polis  is  used  in  the  political  sense  as  well.  Furthermore, he  locates  Ass(er)a  in  the  bay  of  Singos;  cf.  Steph.  Byz. 135.18:       .The territory of  Ass(er)a,  (some  MSS  have  ) is mentioned by Arist.  Hist. an. 519a15.  He  says  that  a  river  named  ran  through the  territory,  and  that  the  territory  was  situated  ;  cf.  Steph.  Byz. 136.1,  who  calls  Ass(er)a  a   ,  perhaps  quoting  Theopompos  fr. 147.  The  col- lective  city-ethnic  is  used  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute lists  (IG i\u00b3  266.ii.26). Scholars  seem  to  agree  that  the  inhabitants  of  Ass(er)a were  the  Asseritans  known  from  the  Athenian  tribute  lists (e.g.  Zahrnt  ( 1971)  163).  The  Asseritans  were  members  of  the Delian  League:  they  belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and are  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.v.7\u00ad8) to 433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.72)  a  total  of  fourteen  times.  In  the  first year  they  paid  together  with  the  Olynthians  (no. 588)  and the  Skablaians  (no. 607).  Thereafter  they  paid  separately. They  paid  2,400  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  262.iii.22)  until  438/7,  when  they paid 3,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  274.vi.14).  Since  the  Asseritans  are  not recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  after  432/1,  it  may  be  inferred that  they  participated  in  the  Revolt  of 432,  along  with  sever- al  other  towns  in  the  area  (Thuc. 1.58). It  is  not  known  whether  Ass(er)a  was  also  a  member  of  the Chalkidian  Federation,  but  its  location,  and  the  fact  that Aristotle  says  that  its  territory  lay      (supra), and  that  Theopompos  probably  called  it  (supra),  suggest  membership  of  the  Chalkidian  Federation. 565.  Charadrous Map 51.  Unlocated.  Type:  A: ? The toponym is (Ps.-Skylax  66).  Charadrous  is called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skylax  66  (Flensted- Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  142),  who  lists  Charadrous between  Akrothooi  (no. 560)  and  Olophyxos  (no. 587)  on Akte.  Charadrous  is  not  mentioned  in  any  other  source. 566.  (Chedrolioi) Map 50.  Unlocated.  Type:  [A]: ? The toponym  is  not  attested,  unless  the  restoration  suggested  by Hatzopoulos  and  Loukopoulou  ( 1992)  126\u00ad27  is  correct (SEG 40  542,  comm.  to  ll. 9\u00ad10),  pace  Vokotopoulou  ( 1996) 215).

The  city-ethnic  is h (IGi\u00b3264.iii.3) or (IGi\u00b3277.vi.25).In 434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.5\u00ad6,  16,  completely  restored)  and  433/2 (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.76\u00ad77,  88)  the  Chedrolians  are  recorded  under the  heading    \u00b5. The  Chedrolians  were  members  of  the  Delian  League. They  belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  are  recorded  in the  tribute  lists  for  the  first time in  448/7  (IG i\u00b3  264.iii.3), then  in  447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.ii.33),  435/4  (IG i\u00b3  277.vi.25,as 434/3(IGi\u00b3278.vi.16),and the last time in 433/2(IG i\u00b3  279.ii.88),  paying  first  500  and  later  1,000  dr.  Since  the Chedrolians  are  absent  from  the  full  panel  of 432/1,it  may  be inferred  that  they  revolted  in  432,  along  with  Poteidaia  (no. 598),  the  Chalkidians  and  the  Bottiaians  (Thuc. 1.58.2),  and thus,  that  they  lived  somewhere  in  the  Chalkidic  peninsula. 567.  Chytropolis  (Chytropolites)  Map  51.Unlocated.Type: C: .  The  toponym  is  (Theopomp.  fr. 141  apud Steph.  Byz. 698.16\u00ad18);  the  city-ethnic  is   (ibid.).  According  to  Stephanos,  Chytropolis  was  called  a chorion  by  Theopompos,  but  Theopompos  also  mentioned that  it  was  settled  ( \u00b5) by Aphytis.  Furthermore, he  called  the  inhabitants  Chytropolitai.  It  is  difficult t o  deter- mine  whether  Chytropolis  was  a  polis,  and  if  so,  where  it  was located.  Zahrnt  (( 1971)  254)  suggests  that  it  was  situated  with- in  the  territory  of  Aphytis. 568.  Dikaia  (Dikaiopolites) Map  50.  Lat. 40.30,long. 22.55.Size  of  territory:  ?  Type:  [A]: .The toponym is  (IG i\u00b3  266.ii.27;Kraay ( 1976)  no. 392).  The  city-ethnic  is (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.55\u00ad56).  The  Dikaiopolitai  are listed  once  under  the  heading   ~ in  the Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.51,  55\u00ad56,  restored  in  IG i\u00b3 281.ii.31ff)  and  again  under  the  heading     as members  of  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2 43.B.9);  in  both  contexts  polis  is  used  in  the  political  sense. The  collective  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on  coins (infra)  and  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3 279.ii.55\u00ad56). 826 flensted-jensen In  the  Epidaurian  list  of  theorodokoi,  Dikaia  is  listed between  Aineia  and  Poteidaia  (IG ii\u00b2.194.i.b.11  ( 360/59)), and  Pliny  mentions  it  after  Therme  (HN 4.36).  It  is  not, however,  mentioned  by  Herodotos  or  Ps.-Skylax  in  their descriptions  of  the  coast  of  the  Chalkidic  peninsula,  so  it may  be  inferred  that  Dikaia  was  situated  inland,  somewhere in  the  north-western  part  of  the  Chalkidic  peninsula;  see also  Viviers  ( 1987)  194\u00ad95. Dikaia  was  colonised  from  Eretria  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.55\u00ad56)  and the  earliest  coins  of  Dikaia  bear  Eretrian  types  (bull/octo- pus;  see  Allan  ( 1940)  34).Dikaia  was  a  member  of  the  Delian League.  It  belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded in  the  tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.19\u00ad20)  to  429/8 (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.55\u00ad56)  a  total  of  sixteen  times,  once  completely restored.  It  is  absent  from  the  full  panel  of 432/1  (IG i\u00b3 280.ii.37\u00ad67),  which  may  indicate  that  it  participated  in  the Revolt  of 432  (Thuc. 1.58);  but  it  is  recorded  in  the  lists  of 430/29  and 429/8  after  the  heading            (IG i\u00b3  281.ii.35,  282.ii.55\u00ad56),  pay- ing 4  tal.  in  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.19\u00ad20)  and  5  tal.  in  453/2  (IG i\u00b3 260.ix.8,  ethnic  partly  restored).  In  435/4  it  paid  1  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 277.vi.15\u00ad16).  In  430/29  and  in  429/8,  however,  it  paid  the quota  only,  i.e. 100  dr.  In  all  other  years  the  amount  is restored  by  the  editors.  Dikaia  became  a  member  of  the Second  Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.9;  Kahrstedt ( 1936)  440)  and  is  also  recorded  in  the  Epidaurian  list  of theorodokoi  of 360/59  (IG iv\u00b2.194.i.b.11).

The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3 269.ii.35;  Thuc. 5.35.1). Dion  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Hdt. 7.22.3  and Ps.-Skylax 66  (Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  142), whereas  Thuc. 4.109.3\u00ad5  probably  uses  polis  in  the  political sense,  using  polisma  about  the  settlement.  The  collective  and external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  the  Athenian tribute  lists  (e.g.  IG i\u00b3  269.ii.35).  Dion  was  situated  on  Athos (IG i\u00b3  272.ii.59;  Hdt. 7.22.3;  Thuc. 4.109.3). Dion  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3 259.ii.26,  restored)  to 429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.22)  a  total  of  seven- teen  times,  three  times  completely  restored,  paying  1  tal. throughout  the  period  (IG i\u00b3  269.ii.35).  In  454/3  it  formed  a syntelic  group  with  Sane  and  Olophyxos.  During  the Peloponnesian  War  Dion  withstood  an  attack  from  Brasidas in 423,  and  consequently  its  territory  was  ravaged  (Thuc. 4.109.5).  The  incident  indicates  that  Dion  was  fortified.  In 421  Dion  took  Thyssos,  which  was  situated  about  10  km from  Dion  on  the  opposite  coast  of  the  peninsula  (Thuc. 5.35.1).  Thyssos  was  an  Athenian  ally  at  that  time,  and  Dion may  have  been  so  too,  since  it  is  known  that  it  did  not  revolt against  Athens  and  join  the  Chalkidians  until  417  (Thuc. 5.82.1).  Dion  was  also  a  member  of  the  Second  Athenian Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.32\u00ad33).  C. 349  Dion  may  have  sent envoys  to Athens  (the  text  is  restored  [  ],  l. 4)  to ask  for help  against  Philip  (IG ii\u00b2  210 259;  Schweigert  ( 1937) 329\u00ad32). A  C 4  coin  found  in  1928  may  be  attributed  to  Dion:  obv. Athena;  rev.  tripod;  legend: .It is uncertain whether the  coin  was  issued  in  Dion  in  Pieria  or  Dion  on  Akte,  but Robinson  and  Clement  prefer  Dion  on  Akte  (( 1938)  282;  cf. Hatzopoulos  ( 1996a)  172). According  to  Strabo  ( 7  frr. 33,35),Dion  and  the  four  other poleis  of  Athos  were  founded  by  Pelasgians  from  Lemnos. Thuc. 4.109.3  informs  us  that  in  his  day  Dion  had  a  mixed (i.e.  barbarian\u00adHellenic)  bilingual  population,  but  a  cen- tury  later  Dion  is  called  a  &lt;polis&gt; Hellenis  by  Ps.-Skylax 66 (Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1998)  151). 570.Eion  Not  in  Barr.  Maps 50\u00ad51.  Unlocated.  Size  of  ter- ritory:? Type:C: .  Only  the  toponym  '  is  known (Thuc. 4.7).  Virtually  nothing  is  known  of  Eion,  which Thuc. 4.7  calls  a     ,  perhaps  indicating that  it  was  a  polis.  It  is  not  the  same  as  its  better-known namesake  on  the  Thracian  coast:  Steph.  Byz.  distinguishes between  the  two  and  calls  this  one      ,   and  then  adds:        (cf.  Eust.  Il. 2.92).  It  is  clear  from  Thuc. 4.7  that  Eion was  an  enemy  of  the  Athenians  in  425,  but  whether  that means  that  it  was  once  a  member  of  the  Delian  League  and had  revolted  in  432,  or  that  it  had  never  been  a  member,  is unknown.  It  never  occurs  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists.  In  425 the  Athenians  took  Eion  by  treachery,  which  indicates  that  it was  fortified ( Thuc. 4.7). 571.  Gale(psos)  (Galaios) Map  51.  Lat. 40.10,long.  23.40. Size of  territory: 2  or 3.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is thrace  from  axios  to  strymon  827 (Hdt. 7.122;  cf.  Kinch  ( 1894)  149).  The  city-ethnic is (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.8),  which  may  be  a  derivative  of  a toponym * ;  if  the  coins  discussed  below  belong  to  the present  community,  they  attest  the  city-ethnic  .It is  possible  that  Herodotos  confounded  the  name  of  *Gale with  that  of  Galepsos  (no. 631)  in  the  Thasian  peraia  (Thuc. 4.107.4),  so  that  the  toponym  is  in  fact  *Gale  and  not Galepsos  (Kinch  ( 1894)  149,  followed  by  Zahrnt  ( 1971)  178, pace  Lepper  ( 1962)  35);  there  may,  however,  be  numismatic evidence  in  support  of  Herodotos'  form  if  the  coins inscribed  (infra)  were struck  by the  present community.  Hdt. 7.122  calls  Gale(psos)  a  polis  principally  in the  urban,  but  probably  also  in  the  political  sense.  The  polit- ical  sense  is  attested  in  IG i\u00b3  278.vi.5,  8  and 279.ii.76,  78, where  the  Galaians  are  listed  under  the  heading   .  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  exter- nally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.8).The  undat- ed  Athenian  grave  inscription  with  the  ethnikon  Galepsios (SEG 32  297)  probably  belongs  to  Galepsos  (no. 631)  in  the Thasian  peraia. According  to  Hdt. 7.122,  Gale(psos)  was  situated  on Sithonia  between  Torone  and  Sermylia.  Zahrnt  ( 1971)  178 locates  Gal(epsos)  south  of  Neos  Marmaras,  where  a  pithos grave  containing  Archaic  Attic  and  Corinthian  pottery  has been  found  (ArchDelt 42  ( 1987)  Chron. 371).  For  a  sanctuary presumably  in  its  territory,  see  supra 815  on  Parthenopolis. Gale(psos)  supplied  Xerxes  with  troops  and  ships  in  480 (Hdt. 7.122).  It  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  The Galaians  belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  are  recorded for  the  first time in  436/5  (IG i\u00b3  276.v.26)  and  in  the  sub- sequent  three  years.  In  435/4  the  Galaians  are  recorded  as (IG i\u00b3  277.v.31).  In  434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.8)  and  in 433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.78)  they  are  listed  after  the  heading     \u00b5 ,  paying 500  dr.  in  436/5  and 435/4, and 3,000  dr.  in  434/3  and 433/2.  Since  Gale(psos)  is  not recorded  in  the  lists  after  432/1,  it  may  have  participated  in the  Revolt  of 432  (Thuc. 1.58.2)  and  was  presumably  one  of the  poleis  that  took  part  in  the  synoecism  of  Olynthos  (no. 588)  in  432  (Thuc. 1.58.2;  Zahrnt  ( 1971)  54).  The  wording  of Thuc. 1.58.2  ( ... and   ) suggests that the city was destroyed in connec- tion  with  the  synoecism.  It  was  assessed  at  10  dr.  in  422/1  (IG i\u00b3  77.v.24). In  the  early  1970s  a  bronze  coin  (a)  was  found  at  the  pre- sumed  site  of  Gale(psos)  (Demetriadi  ( 1974)).  Type:  obv. young  male  head;  rev.  forepart  of  goat  looking  back;  legend: .  One  other  specimen  (b),  bought  from  a coin  dealer,  is  known.  The  coins  have  been  dated  tentatively to C 4f.  The  provenance  of  the  coin  found  on  Sithonia  is  the  reason  why  these  two  coins  have  been  attributed  to  the Gale(psos)  under  discussion  and  not  to  its  namesake  in  the Thasian  peraia  (no. 631).  Demetriadi  ( 1974)  claims  that  no coins  from  the  Thracian  Gale(psos)  are  known.  However,  in 1936  Bon  published  a  coin  (c)  found  during  the  excavations of  Thasos  and  now  (at  least  in  1936)  in  the  Numismatic Museum  in  Athens,  which  she  claims  was  struck  at  Galepsos (no. 631)  in  the  Thasian  peraia.  There  is  absolutely  no  doubt that  Bon  and  Demetriadi  describe  the  same  coin  type.  The diameters  of  (a)  and  (b)  are  14  and 15  mm  respectively,  and the  diameter  of  (c)  is  13  mm.  All  three  have  on  the  obv.an identical  head  of  a  young  man  (Dionysos?)  wearing  an  ivy wreath.  On  the  rev.,  coins  (b)  and  (c)  have  the  forepart  of  a goat  (again  the  types  are  identical)  facing  l.,  and  on  (a)  the goat  faces  r.  All  three  have  the  legend  . Hatzopoulos  attributes  the  coins  to  Galepsos  in  the  Thasian peraia  (in  conversation). 572.  Gigonos Map 50.Lat.40.20,long.  23.00.Size  of  terri- tory: 1  or 2.  Type:  A: ? The toponym is   (Hdt. 7.123.1;  IG i\u00b3  278.vi.32).  Apparently  the  C 2  author Artemidoros  called  it  ,  (Steph.  Byz. 208.2).  Apart from  Steph.  Byz. 208.1  there  is  no  attestation  of  the  city- ethnic.  Hdt. 7.123.2\u00ad3  calls  Gigonos  a  polis  in  the  urban  and political  senses  combined  (cf.  Hansen  ( 2000a)  175\u00ad76),  and the  political  sense  is  attested  in  IG i\u00b3  278.vi.19,  32,where Gigonos  is  listed  under  the  heading  .  According  to Hdt. 7.123.1,  Gigonos  was  located  in  Krousis. Gigonos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League,  but  is recorded  only  once  in  the  tribute  lists,  in  434/3  (IG i\u00b3 278.vi.32),  paying  along  with  the  Tindaians  (no. 619),  Kithas (no. 579),  Smila  (no. 611)  and  Haisa  (no. 573),  under  the heading        ~     .It was  perhaps  assessed  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iv.84,  completely restored). 573.  Haisa Map 50.  Lat. 40.20,long.  23.05.  Size  of  territo- ry: 1?  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is  h (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.33). Apart  from  Steph.  Byz. 54.11,  there  is  no  attestation  of  the city-ethnic. Hdt. 7.123.2  mentions  a  polis in  Krousis.  Lisai  is  not known  from  any  other  source,  and  it  is  commonly  assumed that is  a  scribal  error  for  (Zahrnt  ( 1971)  145).If  so, Hdt. 7.123.2\u00ad3  calls  Haisa  a  polis  mainly  in  the  urban,  but  prob- ably  also  in  the  political  sense  (cf.  Hansen  ( 2000a)  175\u00ad76).  In the  Athenian  tribute  lists  Haisa  is  recorded  under  the  heading               (IG i\u00b3 278.vi.18\u00ad21,  33),  where  polis  is  used  in  the  political  sense. 828 flensted-jensen Haisa  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  However,  it occurs  only  once  in  the  tribute  lists:  viz.in 434/3  (IG i\u00b3 278.vi.33),  where  it  pays  along  with  the  Tindaians  (no. 619), Kithas  (no. 579),Smila  (no. 611)  and  Gigonos  (no. 572).They pay  3,000  dr.  altogether.  The  toponym  is  completely  restored in  the  assessment  decree  of 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iv.85),  but  the amount  ( 3,000  dr.)  is  legible.  Haisa  may  have  been  listed  in the  assessment  decree  of 422/1  (the  heading  in  IG i\u00b3 77.v.41\u00ad42  is  restored  [ ]  [ ] ). Excavations  at  Nea  Kallikrateia  have  revealed  potsherds from  the  early  Iron  Age  and  the  Geometric  period  (ArchDelt 31  ( 1976)  Chron. 247),  and  remains  of  a  C 5  settlement (ArchDelt 29  ( 1973\u00ad74)  Chron. 697,677\u00ad78).According  to  the excavators,  the  site  is  a  colony  of  at  least  C 8l.  It was  occupied until  the  beginning  of  Christian  times.  The  site  has  not  yet been  positively  identified w ith  Haisa  (ArchDelt 32  ( 1977) Chron. 202).  Additional  finds (C 5  graves)  are  mentioned  in ArchDelt 33  ( 1978)  Chron. 236,  34  ( 1979)  Chron. 279. 574.  Istasos Map 51.  Unlocated.  Type:  C:?  The  toponym  is (IG i\u00b3  77.v.16).  Istasos  may  have  been  a  member  of the  Delian  League.  In  422/1  it  was  assessed  at  500  dr.  (IG i\u00b3 77.v.16),  but  is  unattested  in  the  tribute  lists.  The  editors  of the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (ATL  i. 538)  identify  Istasos  with Pistasos  (s.v.). 575.  Kalindoia Map 50.  Lat. 40.35,long.  23.20.  Size  of  ter- ritory:  ?  Type:  [A]: .  The  toponym  is  (IG i\u00b3 76.45  Tod 68  ( 422);  IG iv\u00b2.194.i.b.13  ( 360/59));  Steph.  Byz. 75.7  gives .  Apart  from  Steph.  Byz. 75.8,  there  is  no attestation  of  the  city-ethnic.  Kalindoia  is  listed  under  the heading    in  a  treaty  of  c. 422  (IG i\u00b3  76.44,  45), where polis  is  used  in  the  political  sense. Kalindoia  was  situated  in  northern  Bottike,  perhaps  on the  border  with  Mygdonia,  but  it  was  clearly  a  Bottiaian  polis (Flensted-Jensen  ( 1995)  112\u00ad15).C.422  the  Bottiaians  entered into  an  alliance  with  the  Athenians  (Tod  68  IG i\u00b3  76).  The same  inscription  seems  to  show  that  the  Bottiaians  had formed  a  confederacy  at  that  time  (Flensted-Jensen  ( 1995) 126\u00ad28).  If  they  had,  Kalindoia  must  have  been  one  of  the members  (cf.  Tod  68.46). Kalindoia  is  recorded  in  the  Epidaurian  list  of  theorodokoi of 360/59  (IG iv\u00b2.194i.b.13).  The  name  of  the  theorodokos was ,  who  was  probably  the  pretender  to the Makedonian  throne  in  368/7  (Aeschin. 2.27)  and  in  360/59 (Diod. 16.2.6).  He  may  also  be  the  Pausanias  who  issued  his own  coins  (M.  C.  J.  Miller  ( 1986)).In  323  Kalindoia  and  three neighbouring  territories  were  given  to  the  Makedonians  by Alexander  (SEG 36  626.4\u00ad8). At  modern  Kalamoto  (possibly  the  site  of  Kalindoia)  pot- tery  from  the  Classical  through  the  Roman  periods  has  been found,  along  with  seven  pits  containing  Archaic  sherds (Sismanides  and  Keramaris  ( 1992)). 576.  Kamakai Map 50.  Unlocated.  Type:  A:?  The toponym is \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  285.iii.11  (C 5))  or  [ ]\u00b5 (IG i\u00b3  76.47  Tod 68.48  ( 422)).  The  city-ethnic  is  not recorded  in  any  source.  Kamakai  is  listed  under  the  heading    in  a  treaty  of  c. 422  (IG i\u00b3  76.44,47),where  polis  is used  in  the  political  sense. Kamakai  was  a  Bottiaian  polis  situated  in  the  vicinity  of Kalindoia,  i.e.  probably  in  northern  Bottike  (Flensted- Jensen  ( 1995)  116\u00ad17).  The  name  of  its  territory  was \u00b5  (SEG 36  626.9).  C. 422  the  Bottiaians  entered into  an  alliance  with  the  Athenians  (Tod  68  IG i\u00b3  76).  The same  inscription  seems  to  show  that  the  Bottiaians  had formed  a  confederacy  at  that  time  (Flensted-Jensen  ( 1995) 126\u00ad28).  If  so,  Kamakai  must  have  been  one  of  the  members (cf.  Tod  68.48).Its  territory  was  given  to  the  Makedonians  in 323/2  by  Alexander  (SEG 36  626.4\u00ad8). Kamakai  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League;  it  belonged  to the  Thracian  district,  but  it  is  recorded  only  once  in  the  tribute lists,  namely  in  421/20  (IG i\u00b3  285.iii.11),  paying  only  600  dr. About  the  same  time  the  Bottiaians  had  probably  formed  a confederacy  of  which  Kamakai  was  a  member  (IG i\u00b3  76). 577.  Kampsa Map 50.  Unlocated.  Type:  A: ? The toponym is \u00b5  (Hdt. 7.123.2)  or  (Steph.  Byz. 370.18). is  the  legend  on  coins  of  C 5e  (Head,  HN \u00b2212) and  may  represent  the  city-ethnic  * \u00b5  or * ,  the  latter  being  the  city-ethnic  suggested  by Steph.  Byz. 370.19.  Hdt. 7.123.2\u00ad3  calls  Kampsa  a  polis  mainly in  the  urban  sense,  but  probably  in  the  political  sense  too  (cf. Hansen  ( 2000a)  175\u00ad76). Kampsa  was  located  in  Krousis  (Hdt. 7.123.2).  Some scholars  have  argued  that  the  Skapsaians  recorded  in  the Athenian  tribute  lists  are  the  inhabitants  of  Kampsa  (Zahrnt ( 1971)  232,  followed  by Barr.). Kampsa  may  have struck  silver  coins  before  480  (on  the attribution  to  Kampsa,  see  Flensted-Jensen  ( 1997)  122\u00ad25). Denomination:  tetrobols.  Types:  obv.  ithyphallic  ass  and kylix;  rev.  mill-sail  pattern  and  in  two  of  four  triangles (Head,  HN \u00b2212;  Gaebler  ( 1935)  66\u00ad67;  SNG  Cop.  Macedonia 146).  For  the  type,  see  Wroth  ( 1900)  275\u00ad76).  The  reverse punch  is  the  same  as  that  used  for  some  of  the  coins  of Mende  (Gaebler  ( 1935)  66\u00ad67).Likewise,an  ithyphallic  ass  is also  depicted  on  the  earliest  coins  of  Mende,  though  it  is  not the  same  die. thrace  from  axios  to  strymon  829 578.  Kissos  (Kisseites) Unlocated.  Type:  C: ? The topo- nym  is (Strabo  7  frr. 21,  24).  The  city-ethnic  is (SEG 40  542.14  (C 4)).  The  only  literary  source  to mention  Kissos  is  Strabo,  who  says  (frr. 21,  24)  that Kassandros  founded  Thessalonike  by  synoecising  Kissos and  other  polismata  and  polichnia  respectively.  However,  the city-ethnic  is  known  from  an  inscription  (SEG 40  542) which  can  be  dated  either  to  c. 350  and  assigned  to  north- western  Chalkidike  (Hatzopoulou  and  Loukopoulou  ( 1992) 123\u00ad45),  or  to 294/3  and  assigned  to  south-eastern Chalkidike  (Vokotopoulou  ( 1996)).  The  inscription  con- cerns  the  boundaries  of  various  communities. An  ancient  settlement  at  the  top  of  Mt.  Chortiatis  in north-western  Chalkidike  has  been  investigated  by Bakalakis  ( 1956).  It  consists  of  a  circuit  wall  ( 250 40  m) with  remains  of  houses.  The  pottery  found  at  the  settlement dates  it  to  C 4.  Hammond  thinks  that  this  must  be  ancient Kissos  (Hammond  ( 1972)  187;  cf.  Edson  ( 1947)  89). 579.  Kithas Map 50.  Lat. 40.25,long.  23.05.  Size  of  territo- ry:  ?  Type:  A:?  Only  the  toponym  is  known,  from  an Athenian  tribute  list  in  which  Kithas  is  recorded  under  the heading              (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.18\u00ad21,  30),  where  polis  is  used  in  the  political sense.  Kithas  may  have  been  a  Bottiaian  polis  (Flensted- Jensen  ( 1995)  123\u00ad24). Kithas  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  However,  it  is recorded  only  once  in  the  tribute  lists,  in  434/3  (IG i\u00b3 278.vi.30),  paying  3,000  dr.  along  with  the  Tindaians  (no. 619),  Smila  (no. 611),  Gigonos  (no. 572)  and  Haisa  (no. 573). The  toponym  is  completely  restored  (but  the  amount  is  leg- ible)  in  the  assessment  decree  of 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iv.83). 580.  Kleonai Map 51.  Lat. 40.10,long.  24.15.  Size  of  terri- tory: 1  or 2.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is  , (Hdt. 7.22.3;  IG i\u00b3  278.vi.23  (C 5)).Hdt.7.22.3  and  Ps.-Skylax  66  (cf. Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  142)  call  Kleonai  a  polis in  the  urban  sense,  whereas  Thuc. 4.109.3\u00ad5  probably  uses polis  in  the  political  sense,  using  polisma  about  the  settle- ment.  In  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  Kleonai  is  twice  recorded under  the  heading  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.18\u00ad21,  23  and 279.II.89\u00ad92,  93).  Hdt. 7.22.3  locates  it  on  Athos. Kleonai  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  is  record- ed  four  times,  in  434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.23),  433/2  ( 279.ii.93), 430/29  ( 281.iii.62,  completely  restored)  and  429/8 ( 282.ii.49),  always  with  its  toponym.  In  434/3  and 433/2  it  is listed  under  the  heading                (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.23,  279.ii.93),  in  430/29  (IG i\u00b3 281.iii.62)  under  the  heading          (but here the name is com- pletely,  and  the  amount  partly,  restored),  and  in  429/8  under the  heading          (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.49;  the  amount  is  completely,  and  the  name partly,  restored;  it  seems  plausible,  however,  that  [..][..] should  be  restored  [][  ]).  Kleonai  paid  500  dr.  in  all four  years.  The  editors  of  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  have sug- gested  that  the  poleis  listed  after  the  headings  and were  either  cases  of  apotaxis  or  they  were  isolated  or peripheral  towns  that  had  not  been  members  of  the  Delian League  (ATL  i. 455).  If  Kleonai  was  a  case  of  apotaxis,we must  assume  that  it  had  previously  paid  along  with  one  of the  poleis  in  its  immediate  vicinity--for instance Thyssos (no. 618),  Dion  (no. 569)  or  Olophyxos  (no. 587)--and w e could  reasonably  (albeit  not  necessarily)  have  expected  the payments  by  these  towns  to  be  lower  in  434.  But  there  are  no such  changes  in  the  payments  of  Thyssos,  Dion  or Olophyxos,  so  it  is  equally  likely  that  Kleonai  belongs  to  the group  of  poleis  which  were  isolated  and  peripheral.  The  year 434/3  was  probably  the  first y ear  of  a  new  assessment  period, but  Kleonai  was  not  assessed  by  the  normal  procedure:  it was  added  to  the  list  of  those  already  assessed.  The  same thing  happened  in  the  following  year  ( 433/2),but  in  430/29  it was  assessed  by  the  boule  and  a  court  of 1,500.  The  editors  of the  tribute  lists  interpret  this  as  a  sanctioning  of  Kleonai's assessment  (ATL  i. 457).  In  424/3  it  joined  Brasidas  (Thuc. 4.109.4),  but  in  422/1  it  was  assessed  at  100  dr.  (IG i\u00b3 77.v.14). According  to  Aristotle  (Heracl.  Lemb. 62),  Kleonai  was colonised  by  Chalkidians  from  Elymnios  (in  Euboia no. 365;  see  Bakhuizen  ( 1976)  15),  whereas  Strabo  ( 7  fr. 35)  says that  Pelasgians  from  Lemnos  settled  the  five poleis  on  Athos. Thuc. 4.109.3  says  that  Kleonai  had  a  mixed  bilingual  (i.e. Hellenic\u00adbarbarian)  population,  but  about  a  century  later Ps.-Skylax 66  calls  it  a  polis  Hellenis  (Flensted-Jensen  and Hansen  ( 1996)  151). 581.  Kombreia Map 50.  Unlocated.  Type:  A:?  The  topo- nym  is \u00b5  (Hdt. 7.123.2).  Kinch  ( 1894)  152  has  sug- gested  that  the  ending  - is  the  Thracian  word   (meaning  \"town\")  found  in,  e.g.,  Selymbria  (see  Detschew ( 1957)  s.v.  -bria),  and  some  MSS  do  in  fact  have  \u00b5. The  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5  (SEG 38  681.14,  an  ephebic inscription  of  the  first c entury  ad;  see  Papazoglou  ( 1988) 419).  It  is  significant that the city-ethnic occurs several c en- turies  later  than  the  latest  reference  to  the  town.  This  may mean  that  the  town  existed  from  c. 500  until  the  first c entury ad,  but  it  may  also  mean  that  the  (former)  city-ethnic  was 830 flensted-jensen used  as  a  name,  just  as  the  city-ethnic  '  is  attested long  after  the  city  Olynthos  was  destroyed  (s.v.  Olynthos). Hdt. 7.123.2\u00ad3  calls  Kombreia  a  polis  mainly  in  the  urban sense,  but  probably  in  the  political  sense  too  (cf.  Hansen ( 2000a)  175\u00ad76).  Kombreia  was  situated  in  Krousis  and  pro- vided  Xerxes  with  troops  in  480  (Hdt. 7.123.2). 582.  Lipaxos Map 50.  Unlocated.  Type:  A:?  The  toponym is (Hdt. 7.123.2).  Apart  from  Steph.  Byz. 418.7,  the city-ethnic  is  not  attested.  Hecat.  fr. 149  (apud  Steph.  Byz. 418.7)  mentioned  Lipaxos,  but  it  is  not  clear  whether  he  also called  it  a  polis  (cf.  Hansen  ( 1997b)).  Hdt. 7.123.2\u00ad3  calls Lipaxos  a  polis  mainly  in  the  urban  sense,  but  probably  in the  political  sense  too  (cf.  Hansen  ( 2000a)  175\u00ad76).  Hdt. 7.123.2  locates  Lipaxos  in  Krousis  and  says  that  it  supplied Xerxes  with  troops  in  480. 583.Mekyberna  (Mekybernaios)  Map  50.  Lat. 40.15,long. 23.25.  Size of  territory: 1  or 2.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is , (Hdt. 7.122;Harp. 31) or  (Strabo  7  fr. 29).  The  city-ethnic  is  (Thuc. 5.18.6)  or  (IG i\u00b3  263.iii.15;  cf.  Strabo  7  fr. 29, who  gives  the  corresponding  toponym). Mekyberna  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ps.- Skylax 66  (Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  142)  and  in the  urban  and  political  senses  combined  by  Hdt. 7.122.At Thuc. 5.18.6  (Peace  of  Nikias)  the  territorial  sense  is  a  con- notation.  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (e.g.  IG i\u00b3  263.iii.15). Hdt. 7.122  locates  Mekyberna  between  Sermylia  (no. 604) and  Olynthos  (no. 588)  on  Sithonia.  According  to  Harp. 31,  it  was  located  20  stades  ( 3.6  km)  from  Olynthos,  and excavations  confirm this (Mylonas ( 1943)  78). It  is  not  known  who  founded  Mekyberna  or  when  it  was founded.  The  earliest  attestation  of  Mekyberna  is  in  Hecat. fr. 150;  but  the  settlement  identified w ith  Mekyberna  goes back  to  the  early  Archaic  period  (infra).  Mekyberna  sup- plied  troops  and  ships  to  Xerxes  in  480  (Hdt. 7.122). Mekyberna  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  trib- ute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.v.10),  in  which  year  it  formed a  syntelic  group  along  with  Stolos  (no. 614)  and  the Polichnitans  (no. 596).  It  is  recorded  for  the  last  time  in  the list  of 433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.46),  which  probably  means  that  it took  part  in  the  Revolt  of 432  (Thuc. 1.58).  It  was  assessed  for tribute  in  422/1  (IG i\u00b3  77.v.23,  10  dr.).  Mekyberna  is  recorded in  the  tribute  lists  sixteen  times,  twice  completely  restored, paying  1  tal.  in  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.iii.15)  and  in  447/6  (IG i\u00b3 265.i.12),  4,000  dr.  from  446/5  (IG i\u00b3  266.ii.23)  to  440/39  (IG i\u00b3  272.ii.45),  and  1  tal.  again  from  436/5  (IG i\u00b3  277.v.19)  to 433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.46). According  to  the  Peace  of  Nikias  (Thuc. 5.18.6),  the Mekybernaians,  the  Sanians  (no. 600)  and  the  Singaians (no. 605)  were  to  live  in  their  own  poleis  (       )--many take this to mean that Mekyberna had taken  part  in  the  synoecism  of  Olynthos  in  432  (in  which connection  it  was  probably  razed;  cf.  the  wording  of  Thuc. 1.58.2: ... and ) and was now to be r e-established  as  a  polis (Demand  ( 1990)  76\u00ad77).  Mekyberna  was  garrisoned  by  the Athenians,  but  in  420  it  was  captured  by  the  Olynthians (Thuc. 5.39.1;  cf.  Diod. 12.77.5).  In  349,  before  attacking Olynthos,  Philip  captured  Mekyberna  by  treachery  (Diod. 16.53.2).Robinson  (Robinson  and  Clement  ( 1938)  373\u00ad74;  cf. Robinson  ( 1952)  403)  thinks  that  the  city  was  not  destroyed by  Philip,  and  that  it  was  still  inhabited  in  Alexander's  time (down  to  Kassandros).  Ps.-Skymnos  641  refers  to it  as  no longer  in  existence. Strabo  ( 7  fr. 29)  calls  Mekyberna  epineion  Olynthou, which  may  be  insignificant,  but  an  underwater  survey  has shown  that  it  is  very  likely  that  Mekyberna  was  actually  the harbour  town  of  Olynthos  (AAA 21  ( 1988)  102\u00ad1;  see  also Mylonas  ( 1943)  78).  The  ancient  site  near  the  harbour  dates to  the  period  432\u00ad316. During  the  excavations  of  Olynthos,  Robinson  ( 1935) 229\u00ad31  found  \"the  Hippodamian  plan  of  the  town [Mekyberna]\",  along  with  shops  and  houses.  Seven  streets have  been  found,  unpaved  and  c. 2.5  m  wide  (Mylonas  ( 1943) 82).  The  houses  differ  very  much  in  size,  layout,  etc.  from those  excavated  at  Olynthos  (ibid. 84).  Contrary  to  what  has been  found  at  Olynthos,  there  were  no  drainage  alleys  at Mekyberna  (ibid.).  The  settlement  goes  back  to  the  early Archaic  period  (ibid. 86). 584.Mende (Mendaios)  Map  51.  Lat. 40.00,long.  23.25. Size of  territory: 2.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is  , (Hdt. 7.123.1;  Thuc. 4.121.2)  or  (IG iv\u00b2.194.i.b.26 ( 360/59)).  The  city-ethnic  is  (SEG 13  313  (C 4)). On  Archaic  coins  it  is  sometimes  or (Gaebler  ( 1935)  73\u00ad74).  Mende  is  attested  as  a polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Thuc. 4.129.3)  and  in  the  polit- ical  sense  (Thuc. 4.121.2;  Arist.  Oec. 1350a8,  14);  in  Ps.-Skylax 66  Mende  is  the  second  of  the  toponyms  listed  after  the  heading        `,where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense.  The  collective  use  of  the  city- ethnic  is  attested  internally  on  coins  of  C 5f(infra)  and  exter- nally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (e.g.  IG i\u00b3  270.iii.20)  and  in thrace  from  axios  to  strymon  831 literary  sources  (Thuc. 4.123.2;  Arist.  Oec. 1350a6).  The  indi- vidual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  on  a  C 4m Megarian  gravestone  (SEG 13  313)  and  in  Plato's  reference  to \u00b5  (Prt. 315E). The  territory,  called  ,  is  mentioned  by  Thuc. 4.130.2, who  says  that  it  bordered  on  that  of  Skione  (no. 609)  and was  ravaged  by  Nikias.  Hdt. 7.123.1  locates  Mende  on  Pallene between  Skione  and  Sane  (no. 601)  (cf.  Ps.-Skylax  66).About 4  km  from  Mende,  on  a  promontory,  a  sanctuary  of Poseidon  was  found  in  1989,  with  building  remains  of C 6l\u00adC5  and  pottery  of  C 6e  (Vokotopoulou  ( 1989),  ( 1990a), ( 1991)).  It is  probably  identical  with  the  situ- ated  in  the  territory  of  Mende  (Thuc. 4.129.3). No  literary  source gives  the  date  of  the  colonisation  of Mende,  but  according  to  the  sources  the  site  was  a  colony from  Eretria  (Thuc. 4.123.1;  cf.  Harp.  s.v. ).This is sup- ported  by  the  archaeological  remains:  the  late  Mycenaean and  early  Geometric  pottery  found  at  the  site  of  ancient Mende  is  similar  to  that  found  at  Lefkandi  (ArchDelt 42 ( 1987)  Chron. 368\u00ad69,  pace Papadopoulos  ( 1996)). Furthermore,  peculiar  stone-paved  circles  (diameter  1.80 m),  similar  to  those  found  at  Lefkandi,  have  been  found inside  house  ,which dates to C8,along with pendant semi- circle  skyphoi  (ArchDelt 45  ( 1990)  Chron. 315  and  fig. 141a; Vokotopoulou  ( 1990a)).Most  scholars  think  that  Mende  was founded  in  C 8  (Boardman  ( 1980)  229).  However,  it  seems that  the  site  of  Mende  was  occupied  long  before  the  coloni- sation  took  place,  and  that  it  had  links  with  Euboia  from  a very  early  period.  For  interpretations  of  the  finds,  see Snodgrass  ( 1994)  and  Papadopoulos  ( 1996)  163\u00ad65. According  to  Hdt. 7.123.1,  Mende  supplied  troops  and ships  to  Xerxes  in  480.  Mende  was  a  member  of  the  Delian League.  It  belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded in  the  tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.15)  to  415/14  (IG i\u00b3 290.iii.10)  a  total  of  nineteen  times,  paying  between  5  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  268.iii.5)  and  15  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.15),  but  mostly  8  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  262.i.7).  In  423  Mende  joined  Brasidas,  even  though Athens  and  Sparta  had  already  concluded  an  armistice (Thuc. 4.123;  cf.  Diod. 12.72.7).  The  uprising  was  instigated by  an  oligarchic  faction  which  seems  to  have  forced  the majority  to  accept  the  defection  (Thuc. 4.123.2,  cf. 4.121.2); an  oligarchic  constitution  was  adopted  ( 4.130.7);  a Peloponnesian  garrison  was  placed  in  the  city;  and  Brasidas had  the  women  and  children  sent  to  Olynthos  (no. 588) (Thuc. 4.123.4).  The  Athenians  sent  a  force  of 50  triremes, 1,000  hoplites  and  a  higher  number  of  light-armed  soldiers against  Mende  ( 4.129.2).  They  took  the  proasteion,ravaged the  territory,  and  eventually  captured  the  city,  when  the Mendaian  demos  took  up  arms  against  the  oligarchs  and  the Peloponnesian  garrison  and  opened  the  gates  (Thuc. 4.129\u00ad30).  Having  arranged  a  siege  of  the  oligarchs  and  the Peloponnesians  ( 4.131.3),  who  made  a  last  stand  on  the acropolis,  the  Athenians  left  a  garrison  in  Mende,  ordering that  the  Mendaians  restore  their  (democratic)  constitution and  prosecute  the  leaders  of  the  Revolt  (Thuc. 4.130.7; Gehrke,  Stasis 111\u00ad12). From  the  treaty  of  the  380s  between  Amyntas  III  and  the Chalkidians,  it  appears  that  the  Mendaians  were  enemies  of the  Chalkidians  (Syll. \u00b3135.19  Tod 111),  and  Mende  is known  to  have  been  at  war  with  Olynthos  at  some  point  in C 4  (Arist.  Oec. 1350a11\u00ad14).  Mende  was  probably  not destroyed  by  Philip,  but  it  may  have  lost  its  polis  status.  It  is called  a  vicus  maritimus  of  Kassandreia  c. 200  (Livy  31.45.14). In C 4e  Theotimides,  a  citizen  of  Mende  was  granted  pro- xenia  by  Elis  (no. 251)  (SEG 15  241).  About  the  same  time, perhaps  a  little  earlier,  some  Mendaians  were  granted  pro- xenia  in  Delphi  (no. 177)  (SEG 31  557;  BCH 105  ( 1981) 433\u00ad40).  Mende  is  recorded  in  the  Epidaurian  list  of theorodokoi  of 360/59  (IG iv\u00b2.194.i.b.26). Thuc. 4.130.6\u00ad7  and 131.3  mentions  that  Mende  had  a  for- tified acropolis.  A  Geometric  wall  surrounding  the  pre- sumed  acropolis  of  Mende  has  been  found  (AR  ( 1992\u00ad93) 54).  Thucydides  also  mentions  the  walls  ( 4.130.3)  and  gates ( 4.130.2,5)  of  Mende,  along  with  the  proasteion  ( 4.130.1).The harbours  of  Mende  are  mentioned  at  Arist.  Oec. 1350a6. Excavations  at  Mende  have  revealed  various  remains:  a destruction  layer  from  C 4m  can  perhaps  be  connected  with the  Makedonian  invasion  in  356  or 348  (ArchDelt 41  ( 1986) Chron. 148).  Pits  (probably  used  for  storage)  filled w ith debris  from  the  Mycenaean  to  the  Geometric  periods  show that  the  site  of  Mende  was  inhabited  from  an  early  period (ArchDelt 41  ( 1986)  Chron. 149).  Two  houses  have  been  exca- vated  in  the  proasteion,  which  seems  to  have  been  occupied continuously  from  C 8  to C 4  (ArchDelt 41  ( 1986)  Chron. 147, 42  ( 1987)  Chron. 369).  Underneath  house  (C 8m)  were found  six  more  habitation  layers,  the  earliest  of  C 9m (Vokotopoulou  ( 1990a)).  A  cemetery  has  been  found  near the  coast.  It  was  in  use  from  C 8l  to  C 7l/C6e.  By  1990,  214 graves  had  been  found. Mende  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Euboic  standard c. 500\u00adc.424  and  on  the  Phoenician  standard  c. 424\u00adc.358. Denominations:  tetradrachms,  tetrobols,  obols,  hemiobols, tritemorias  and  tetartemoria.

Mende  colonised  Neapolis  (no. 586)  (IG i\u00b3  263.iii.26\u00ad27), which  was  situated  c. 12  km  from  Mende  on  the  opposite coast  of  Pallene,  and  Eion  (no. 570)  (Thuc. 4.7),  the  location of  which  is  unknown. 585.  Milkoros  (Milkorios)  Map  51.  Unlocated.  Type:  [A]:? The  toponym  is  known only  from  Steph.  Byz. 453.11  quoting  Theopomp.  fr. 152,  presumably  referring  to the year 347  (Shrimpton  ( 1991)  240).  The  city-ethnic  is (IG i\u00b3  277.vi.31)  or  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.85).In the  Athenian  tribute  lists  of 434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.5\u00ad6,  9)  and 433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.76\u00ad77,85)  the  Milkorians  are  recorded  after the  heading     \u00b5.Steph.Byz. 453.11  describes  Milkoros  as  a       . He  may  have  used  Theopompos  (cf.  fr. 152)  as  a  source  for  this information,  which  is  ambiguous,  since  \"Chalkidian\"  can refer  to  either  (a)  the  geographical  position  of  the  Milkorians, (b)  membership  of  the  Chalkidian  Federation,  or  (c)  ethnic affiliation.  The  editors  of  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  state  that Milkoros  must  be  a  member  of  the  Chalkidic  state  but  that  its precise  location  is  not  known  (ATL  i. 520). Milkoros  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  three  times  in  the tribute  lists,  in  435/4  (IG i\u00b3  277.vi.31, ),  in  434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.9)  and  in  433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.85).  Some  scholars believe  that  it  took  part  in  the  Revolt  of 432  (e.g.  Zahrnt ( 1971)  205).  It paid  1,000  dr.  in  435/4,  and 500  dr.  in  the  fol- lowing  two  years. 586.  Neapolis  (Neopolites) Map  50.  Lat. 40.00,long. 23.30.  Size  of  territory: 2.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is   (Hdt. 7.123.1),  or  (IG i\u00b3  267.ii.29).  The city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.28).  The  citizens  are sometimes  called        (IG i\u00b3 262.i.9\u00ad10)  in  order  to  distinguish  them  from  the  other Neopolitans  in  the  Thasian  peraia  (see  infra  no. 634),  and sometimes  they  are  identified politically as the      (IG i\u00b3  263.iii.26\u00ad27)  or  simply  the  (IGi\u00b3  281.ii.13).The  classification of Neapolis  as  a  polis  seems  to  follow  from  the  toponym,  but  at Hdt. 7.123.1  polis  is  used  explicitly  about  the  community,  in the  urban  and  political  senses  simultaneously  (cf.  Hansen ( 2000a)  175\u00ad76).  The  collective city-ethnic  is  used  external- ly  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  263.iii.26\u00ad27). Neapolis  was  probably  a  colony  from  Mende  (no. 584)  (IG i\u00b3  263.iii.26\u00ad27).Hdt.7.123.1  locates  the  city  between  Aphytis (no. 563)  and  Aige  (no. 556)  on  Pallene  and  says  that Neapolis  supplied  troops  and  ships  to  Xerxes  in  480. Neapolis  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from 454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.28)  to,  perhaps, 415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.iii.6:in this  case  it  is  not  certain  whether  the  Neapolis  listed  is  the Thasian  Neapolis  (no. 634)  or  Neapolis  on  Pallene)  a  total  of twenty  (or  perhaps  twenty-one)  times,  paying  3,000  dr.  in  all years  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.28). A  settlement  of  C 6\u00adC5,at  modern  Polychronon,  has  been excavated  since  1987,  and  it  has  been  suggested  that Polychronon  is  ancient  Neapolis  (AR  ( 1988\u00ad89)  73, ( 1989\u00ad90)  52),  although  it  may  also  be  Aige  (Vokotopoulou ( 1993)  95).  The  following  have  been  found  at  Polychronon: sherds  from  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods,  a  C 5  kiln, remains  of  C 6  buildings,  two  cemeteries  dating  to  C 6l\u00adC4m (ArchDelt 42  ( 1987)  Chron. 369\u00ad70;  Vokotopoulou  ( 1990b)). The  place  was  probably  abandoned  in  C 4s  (ArchDelt 43 ( 1988)  Chron. 364).An  inscribed  sherd,  c. 500,bears  the  word \u00b5  (SEG 39  614;  photo  in  Vokotopoulou  et al.( 1988) fig. 16).The  ancient  settlement  was  located  on  the  slopes  of  a hill,  and  the  houses  were  placed  on  terraces.  The  walls  were either  parallel  to  the  terraces  or  vertical  retaining  walls (Vokotopoulou  et al.( 1989)). 587.  Olophyxos  (Olophyxios)  Map  51.  Lat. 40.20,long. 24.10.  Size of  territory: 1  or 2.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is ',  (Hdt. 7.22.3;  schol.  Ar.  Av. 1042)  or,  once, '  (Strabo  7  fr. 33)  or  '  (Ps.-Skylax  66, emended  to ').  The  city-ethnic  is  ' (IG i\u00b3  268.ii.23;Ar.  Av. 1041)  or  sometimes  '    (IG i\u00b3  281.ii.22).  Hdt. 7.22.3  and  Ps.-Skylax  66  (cf. Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  142)  call  Olophyxos  a  polis in  the  urban  sense,  whereas  Thuc. 4.109.3\u00ad5  probably  uses polis  in  the  political  sense,  using  polisma  about  the  settlement. The  collective  city-ethnic  is  used  internally  on  coins  (infra) and  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  268.ii.23). Olophyxos  was  located  on  Athos  (Hdt. 7.22.3; Thuc. 4.109.3;  IG i\u00b3  281.ii.22).  Zahrnt  ( 1971)  184,  208  suggests that  it  was  situated  at  modern  Vatopediou  or  Iviron  (on  the northern  side  of  the  peninsula). thrace  from  axios  to  strymon  833 Olophyxos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  from 454/3,  paying  together  with  Sane  (no. 600)  and  Dion  (no. 569)  (IG i\u00b3  259.ii.25\u00ad26)  and  then,  paying  separately,  until 429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.26)  a  total  of  sixteen  times,  three  times completely  restored,  paying  2,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  262.i.26)  except in 448/7,  when  it  paid  1,500  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  264.ii.25).  In  424/3 Olophyxos  revolted  from  Athens  at  the  instigation  of Brasidas  (Thuc. 4.109.4). Strabo  says  that  Olophyxos  and  the  other  four  poleis  on Athos  (nos. 560,  569,  580,  618)  were  settled  by  Pelasgians  from Lemnos  ( 7  fr. 35).  According  to  Thuc. 4.109.3\u00ad4,  Olophyxos had  a  mixed  (i.e.  barbarian\u00adHellenic)  bilingual  population, but  about  a  century  later  it  is  called  a  &lt;polis&gt; Hellenis  by  Ps.- Skylax 66  (Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  151). Olophyxos  struck  bronze  coins,  c. 350.  Types:  obv.  female head;  rev.  eagle;  legend: (Gaebler  ( 1935) 83\u00ad84;Head,  HN \u00b2  206). 588.  Olynthos  (Olynthios) Map  50.  Lat. 40.15,long.  23.25. Size of  territory: 5,  after  432  c. 630  km \u00b2,  in  C 4  larger.  Type: A: .  The  toponym  is  ,  (Thuc. 1.63.1;Dem.  9.56). The  city-ethnic  is  '  (Dem. 1.7;  SEG 21  982  (C 4)). Olynthos  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Hdt. 8.127; Thuc. 1.58.2;Dem.  9.11;Xen.  Hell. 5.3.3;  Ps.-Skylax 66;  cf. Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  142),  and  in  the  political sense  (Thuc. 5.18.5:  Peace  of  Nikias;  Dem. 3.7).  At Thuc. 5.18.6  the  territorial  sense  is  a  connotation.  The  collective city-ethnic  is  used  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  271.ii.50),  and  internally  on  coins  (Gaebler  ( 1935)  84 (c. 432\u00ad420))  and  sling-bullets  (Robinson  ( 1941)  no. 2220) with  the  legend  .  The  individual  city-ethnic  is  used externally  in  funerary  inscriptions  from  Attika  (SEG 21  982 (C 4l))  and  Thasos  (no. 526)  (IG xii.8434  (c. 400)).The  use  of the  city-ethnic  is  attested  long  after  Olynthos  was  destroyed (SEG 19  595,  from  Thasos  (C 4\u00adC3);  IG xii.342,  from  Telos (C 2);  Syll. \u00b3751,  from  Mytilene  (C 1);  see  Gude  ( 1933)  39\u00ad50  (a complete  Prosopographia  Olynthia)  and  Papazoglou  ( 1988) 426\u00ad27).  Demosthenes  ( 1.5,  9.56)  and  Hypereides  (Hyp.  fr. 80,  Sauppe)  use  patris  about  Olynthos,  and  Dem. 9.56  refers to  the  politai  of  Olynthos  ( 9.56). The  name  of  Olynthos'  territory  was  '  (Xen. Hell. 5.3.18;  SEG 38  619.11  (c. 285);  Theophr.  Caus.  Pl. 1.20.4). After  the  synoecism  in  432  (Thuc. 1.58.2)  the  size  of  the  terri- tory  was  perhaps  630  km \u00b2,  but  in  the  380s  it  was  much larger (Hoepfner  and  Schwandner  ( 1994)  71). According  to  Dem. 19.263,  the  military  strength  of Olynthos  before  the  synoecism  was  400  cavalry  and  in  all some 5,000  men  in  service,  corresponding  to some  7,000 adult  male  citizens;  see  Hansen  ( 1985)  9\u00ad13,  18\u00ad20. (Xenophon's  figures for  382  (Hell. 5.2.14)  are  corrupt. Demosthenes' 1,000  horse  and  10,000  foot  in  348  ( 19.266) are  the  army of  the  Chalkidic  Confederacy,  not  that  of Olynthos.)  Given  the  growth  of  Olynthos  in  the  following period,  a  total  of 7,000  citizens  before  the  synoecism  match- es  Diodorus'  information  that,  in  357,  Olynthos  had  a  large population  ( 16.8.4)  and  that,  in  348,  it  was  a  myriandros polis:  i.e.  a  polis  with 10,000  citizens  ( 32.4.2).  In the  period 432\u00ad380  the  population  living  in  the  urban  centre  of Olynthos  (see  infra)  was  probably  less  than  5,000,  and  in 370\u00ad348  less  than  10,000  (Hansen  ( 1997a)  30;  cf.  Hoepfner and  Schwandner  ( 1994)  72). Olynthos  supplied  Xerxes  with  troops  and  ships  in  480 (Hdt. 7.122).  Hdt. 8.127  says  that  Olynthos  belonged  to  the Bottiaians  before  479,  and  that  it  was  handed  over  to  the Chalkidians  in  479.  This  is  confirmed b y  the  pottery  found during  the  excavations  of  Olynthos.  Above  the  destruction layer  of 479  the  sherds  were  Attic  red-figure,  but  underneath the  destruction  layer  was  found  pottery  \"that  bears  no resemblance  to  the  ware  produced  at  the  same  time  in Attica\"  (Robinson  ( 1933b)  15\u00ad16).  In  424  Olynthos  is  called \"Chalkidian\"  by  Thuc. 4.123.4  (see  Hornblower  ( 1997)). Olynthos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3 259.v.6,forming  a  syntelic  group  with  Ass(er)a  (no. 564)  and the  Skablaians  (no. 607))  to  433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.45)  a  total  of eleven  times,  paying  2  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  263.iii.30).  In  432  the Chalkidians  (represented  by  Olynthos  in  the  tribute  lists) revolted  from  Athens,  along  with  Poteidaia  (no. 598)  and  the Bottiaians,  at  the  instigation  of  Perdikkas,  who  also  suggest- ed  that  the  Chalkidians  abandon  their  poleis  on  the  coast and  create  a  larger  and  stronger  city  at  Olynthos  (Thuc. 1.57.5,  58.2;  cf.  Diod. 12.34.2).  In  the  Peace  of  Nikias  Olynthos is  declared  autonomos  and  liable  to  the  tribute  assessed  by Aristeides  (Thuc. 5.18.5). Olynthos  was  the  leading  member  of  the  Chalkidian Federation,  which  was  formed  some  time  after  432  (West ( 1918)  31  and  Larsen  ( 1968)  62  suggest 432;  Gude  ( 1933)  23 and  Zahrnt  ( 1971)  80ff  after  400;  cf.  Demand  ( 1990)  196 n. 28).  It  is  uncertain  whether  the  federation  was  formed simultaneously  with  the  synoecism  of  Olynthos,  or  later.  In official documents the name of  the  federation  is   (Syll. \u00b3135.3),  but  in  literature  it  is  often   '  (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.13).  In  the  Corinthian  War  the Chalkidians  seem  to  have  fought  on  Athens'  side  (Isae. 5.46; Diod. 14.82.3).  In the  380s  the  Federation  evidently  covered 834 flensted-jensen the  western  part  of  the  Chalkidic  peninsula  all  the  way  to Pella  (no. 543).  Apollonia  (no. 545)  and  Akanthos  (no. 559) saw  the  Federation  encroaching  on  their  lands  and  sent envoys  to  Sparta  to  ask  for  help  against  it  (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.11ff). This  resulted  in  the  so-called  Olynthian  War,  after  which  the Chalkidians  had  to  surrender  to  the  Spartans  (Xen. 5.3.1\u00ad10, 18\u00ad19,  26;Diod.  15.19.3,  21.1\u00ad23.3;  siege  mentioned  by  Isoc. 4.126;Diod.  15.23.3  with  Stylianou  ( 1998)  209\u00ad26).  The Federation  was  suppressed  or  dissolved,  but  formed  again shortly  after:  the  Chalkidians  are  listed  as  members  of  the Second  Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.5\u00ad6;  cf.  Dreher ( 1995)  186\u00ad87).  The  original  members  of  the  Chalkidian Federation  are  not  known,  but  possible  candidates  are Ass(er)a  (no. 564),  Gale(psos)  (no. 571),  Mekyberna  (no. 583),  Milkoros  (no. 585),  Piloros  (no. 593),  Singos  (no. 605), Skablaioi  (no. 607)  and  Stolos  (no. 614).  In  356  Philip  II  con- cluded  an  alliance  with  the  Chalkidic  Federation  (Tod  158) whereby  Poteidaia  (no. 598),  when  conquered,  and Anthemous  (no. 562)  were  ceded  to  Olynthos  (Dem. 2.7,  20; 6.20,  23.107;Diod.  16.8.3\u00ad5).  But  in  349  the  Olynthians  con- cluded  an  alliance  with  Athens  (Dem. 1  and 2;  Philoch.  fr. 49).  Philip  attacked  Olynthos,  won  two  battles  and  laid  siege to  the  city.  The  Athenians  sent  three  auxiliary  forces;  but  in August 348,Olynthos  was  betrayed  to  Philip  by  the  leaders  of its  cavalry  (Dem. 9.11,  19.263\u00ad67;Diod.  16.53.2;  Philoch.  frr. 49\u00ad51;  Suda 356;  see  Hammond  and  Griffith ( 1979)  324 n. 1). Olynthos  experienced  andrapodismos  twice,  in  479  and  in 348:  when  in  479  the  Olynthians  were  suspected  of  revolting against  the  Persians,  the  inhabitants  were  killed  and  the  city given  to  the  Chalkidians  (Hdt. 8.127).  The  town  was  proba- bly  burnt  (Robinson  ( 1933b)  15).  The  city  was  synoecised  in 432,  when  the  coastal  poleis  in  the  neighbourhood  of Olynthos  were  abandoned  and  the  inhabitants  moved  to Olynthos  (Thuc. 1.58;  Moggi,  Sin. 173\u00ad88),  thus  causing  the formerly  small  town  to  be  enlarged  (Hoepfner  and Schwandner  ( 1994)  74\u00ad76  fig. 55).  In  the  years  after  379  the urban  centre of  Olynthos  was  considerably  enlarged  (ibid. 92),  presumably  the  result  of  a  new  synoikismos  by which more  Chalkidians  were  moved  to  Olynthos  (Dem. 19.263). Xenophon  calls  Olynthos  \"the  largest  polis  of  Thrace\"  (Hell. 5.2.12).  In  348  the  city  was  completely  destroyed  by  Philip (Dem. 9.26,  9.56;Hyp.  fr. 80,  Sauppe),  and  the  inhabitants suffered  andrapodismos  once  more  (Diod. 16.53.3),  although some  of  them  evidently  managed  to flee,  e.g.  to  Lemnian Myrina  (no. 502)  (IG xii.84).  Diod. 19.52.2  (r 316)  mentions surviving  Olynthians  too.  According  to  Theophrastos  (apud Harp. 162.10\u00ad11),  the  Olynthians  living  in  Athens  after  the destruction  of  Olynthos  were  isoteleis.  Even  though  it  seems clear  that  Olynthos  was  razed  to  the  ground  in  348,  it  must have  been  refounded,  though  not  necessarily  as  a  polis:a couple  are  recorded  as  living   '  in  the  imperial period  (SEG 38  625),  and  Hatzopoulos  ( 1988b)  64\u00ad65  argues that  Olynthos  was  a  kome  of  Kassandreia  at  that  time. The  character  of  the  Olynthian  constitution  is  unknown: some  scholars  think  that  Olynthos  was  an  oligarchy  (Zahrnt ( 1971)  94;  Larsen  ( 1968)  58ff,  esp. 76),  whereas  others  argue that  it  was  a  democracy  (Gehrke,  Stasis 124).  Theopomp.  fr. 143  mentions  the  boule,  and  Xen.  Hell. 5.2.17  a  popular assembly  (demos)  whose  decisions  are  described  as  psephis- mata  ( 5.2.15).  Dem. 9.56  reports  how  the  assembly  ( \u00b5  ') imposed a sentence of  exile.  Not  much  is known  about  Olynthian  officials;  but  hipparchoi  are  known to  have  been  elected  by  show  of  hands  (Dem. 9.66). Olynthos  is  recorded  in  the  Epidaurian  list  of  theorodokoi  of 360/59  (IG iv\u00b2.194.i.b.14).Olynthos  is  sometimes  thought  to represent  the  Chalkidian  Federation  in  the  list  (e.g.  Zahrnt ( 1971)  103).  Hegias  of  Olynthos  was  granted  citizenship  by Ephesos  (no. 844)  in  C 4l/C3e  (SEG 39  1156). Olynthos  was  excavated  in  the  1930s.The  town  was  situat- ed  on  a  table-shaped  hill,  about  3.5  km  from  the  coast.  Down to c. 432  Olynthos  was  a  relatively  small  town  (it  probably covered c. 6  ha:  Hoepfner  and  Schwandner  ( 1994)  74),  occu- pying  the  southern  part  of  the  elevation  on  which  the  city was  built.  In  432  the  city  was  greatly  enlarged  (to  cover  c. 27 ha)  and  during  the  first  20  years  of  C 4  it  was  enlarged  once more:  this  time  houses  were  built  outside  the  city  walls  (ibid. 76\u00ad91  figs. 55  and 56).  The  old  part  of  the  city  did  not  have  a grid  plan,  but  the  new  town  was  laid  out  in  rectangular  fash- ion  in  blocks  of  up  to  ten  houses  of  the  so-called  pastas  type (ibid. 34\u00ad38  and  figs. 23  and 24;  Wycherley  ( 1976)  187\u00ad92). The  elevation  on  which  Olynthos  was  situated  is  about  600 m  long,  and  runs  almost  exactly  north\u00adsouth.  Nearly  the whole  north  hill  is  divided  into  sections  by  streets (Robinson  and  Graham  ( 1938)  18ff).On  the  urban  organisa- tion  of  Olynthos,  see  also  Cahill  ( 2002). Not  many  public  buildings  have  been  identified,  excep- tions  being  the  agora  (Hoepfner  and  Schwandner  ( 1994) 78),  along  with  a  C 5l  bouleuterion  (Gneisz  ( 1990)  341,no. 48  (C 5l))  and  a  public  building  that  has  been  variously identified as a prytaneion  (ibid. 342,no.  49  (C 5e))  or  a bouleuterion  (S.  G.  Miller  ( 1978)  131\u00ad32).  The  south  room accommodated  c. 250  persons  (McDonald  ( 1943)  236), which  indicates  that  it  may  have  been  a  dikasterion. The  city  walls  of  Olynthos  are  mentioned  by  Thuc. 1.63.2 and  Xen.  Hell. 5.3.5,  who  also  mentions  towers.  However, thrace  from  axios  to  strymon  835 hardly  anything  is  left.  The  city  walls  were  built  of  mudbrick, mostly  on  a  rubble  foundation.  No sherds  or  any  other  evid- ence  useful  for  dating  the  wall  have  been  found  (Robinson and  Graham  ( 1938)  39\u00ad44). There  are  a  few  remains  of  a  free-standing  fountain  house with  an  underground  aqueduct  made  of  terracotta  pipes.  It is  one  of  the  best-preserved  Greek  aqueducts.  Robinson argues  that  it  was  completed  before  400,  or  perhaps  even before  420,  and  that  the  source  of  the  aqueduct  was  at  mod- ern  Polygyros,  about  15  km  to  the  north-east  of  Olynthos (Robinson  ( 1946)  95\u00ad114;  on  the  water  management,  see Crouch  ( 1993)  171\u00ad76). Remains  of  what  may  have  been  an  Archaic  temple (destroyed  in  479)  have  been  found  (Robinson  ( 1930) 16\u00ad17).  The  excavations  at  Olynthos  brought  to  light  not only  vases,  mosaics,  etc.,  but  also  more  curious  things,  such as  ear-picks,  tweezers  and  fish-hooks (Robinson ( 1941) 354\u00ad55,355\u00ad56,365\u00ad74).At  least  eight  Panathenaic  vases  have been  identified,  indicating  that  Olynthians  must  have  par- ticipated  and  been  victorious  in  the  Panathenaic  Games (Robinson  ( 1933b)  87\u00ad90  nos. 97\u00ad100,(1950)  9,  59\u00ad66  nos. 11\u00ad14). Around  the  city  were  three  cemeteries  (Robinson  ( 1942)). The  largest  is  the  so-called  Riverside  cemetery,  containing 528  graves,  the  cemeteries  to  the  east  and  north  being  much smaller.  There  were  altogether  598  graves.  The  Riverside cemetery  is  the  earliest  of  the  three,  although  no  grave  can  be dated  earlier  than  C 6l.Graves  in  the  eastern  cemetery  date  to C 5l,  and  those  in  the  northern  one  to  C 4f  (ibid. 137). Six  month  names  are  known,  principally  from  C 4m  deeds of  sale  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1988a)  65\u00ad66,  80),  attesting  to a  clear affinity between the Olynthian calendar and that of  the Euboian  cities  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 42\u00ad43). Olynthos  started  striking  silver  coins  on  the  Phoenician standard  c. 433.  Denominations:  tetradrachms,  octobols, tetrobols  and  diobols.  Types:  obv.  horse;  rev.  eagle  holding snake;  legend: or .From 432,  or  perhaps  later, down to  348,  the  coins  have  obv.  head  of  Apollo;  rev.a kithara;  legend: .  Some  have  magistrates' names  on  rev.  The  Chalkidians  also  struck  gold  and  bronze coins  in  C 4  (Head,  HN \u00b2207;Gaebler  ( 1935)  84\u00ad89;Robinson and  Clement  ( 1938)  1\u00ad210;  Westermark  ( 1988);  SNG  Cop. Macedonia 233\u00ad49).  Some  C 5f  coins  inscribed  must be  attributed  to  Chalkis  (LSAG 82\u00ad83,  364),  rather  than  to Olynthos  (no. 365)  (Head,  HN \u00b2207). 589.  (Osbaioi) Map 50.  Unlocated.  Type:  C:?  Only  the city-ethnic  is  known: '  (SEG 40  534  (c. 400)).  The individual  city-ethnic  is  used  externally  on  a  gravestone from  Beroia  (SEG 40  534),  and  the  collective city-ethnic  is used  externally(?)  in  an  inscription  concerning  borders (SEG 40  542.26,  32).  There  is  some  dispute  as  to the  prove- nance  and  date  of  this  inscription.  Vokotopoulou  ( 1996) assigns  it  to  south-eastern  Chalkidike  and  dates  it  to  294/3, whereas  Hatzopoulos  and  Loukopoulou  ( 1992)  123\u00ad45 assign  it  to  north-western  Chalkidike  and  date  it  to  c. 350. Since  the  ethnic  is  known  exclusively  from  these  two inscriptions,  there  is  no  way  of  telling  whether  Osbaios  is  a sub-ethnic,  a  city-ethnic  or  a  regional  ethnic  (for  these  distinctions,  see  Hansen  ( 1996)  esp. 182\u00ad90),  although Hatzopoulos  ( 1996a)  202  seems  certain  that  it  is  a  city- ethnic. 590.  Othoros  (Othorios) Map  51.  Unlocated.  Type:  [A]:? The  toponym  is  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.35).  The  city-ethnic  is '  (IG i\u00b3  269.iii.27).  In the  Athenian  tribute  list  of 434/3  Othoros  is  recorded  after  the  heading            (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.18\u00ad21,  35). The  location  of  Othoros  is  not  known.  It  disappears  from the  tribute  lists  in  434/3,  which  indicates  that  Othoros  took part  in  the  Revolt  of 432  (Thuc. 1.58)  and  was,  therefore,  sit- uated  somewhere  on  the  Chalkidic  peninsula  (see  Edson ( 1947)  99).  However,  the  editors  of  the  Athenian  tribute  lists think  it  may  have  been  situated  near  Methone  (ATL  i. 489). Othoros  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists from  448/7  (IG i\u00b3  264.ii.18)  to  434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.35)  a  total  of nine  times,  three  times  completely  restored.  It  is  recorded once  by toponym  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.35),  and  otherwise  by  city- ethnic,  paying  between  500  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.35)  and  700  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  269.iii.27).  In  435/4  the  Othorians  are  recorded  as  ataktoi (IG i\u00b3  277.vi.24).In  422/1  Othoros  was  assessed  for  tribute  of 1,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  77.v.15).  Othoros  is  not  known  from  any other  source. 591.  Pharbelos  (Pharbelios) Map  51.  Unlocated.  Type: [A]:?  The  toponym  is  (IG i\u00b3  268.ii.24;  Steph.  Byz. 658.15).The  city-ethnic  is  (IGi\u00b3268.ii.24).In the Athenian  tribute  lists  of 434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.5\u00ad6,15)  and  433/2 (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.76\u00ad77,86)  the  Pharbelians  are  recorded  after  the heading   \u00b5. The  Pharbelians  were  members  of  the  Delian  League. They  belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  are  recorded from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.i.15)  to  433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.86)  a  total  of fourteen  times,  once  completely  restored,  paying  1,000  dr. from  454/3  to 435/4,but only 500  dr.  in  the  two  following years  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.15,  279.ii.86).  They  were  assessed  for  836 flensted-jensen tribute  in  422/1  (IG i\u00b3  77.v.19),  500  dr.  The  fact  that  the Pharbelians  did  not  pay  tribute  after  432  may  indicate  that they  took  part  in  the  Revolt  of 432  (Thuc. 1.58.2),  and  also that  they  lived  in  the  Chalkidic  peninsula  (ATL  i. 560). Steph.  Byz. 658.15  calls  Pharbelos  a  polis  Eretrieon.  Zahrnt ( 1971)  251  thinks  that  the  Pharbelos  mentioned  by Stephanos  must  be  a  locality  in  Euboia  and  different  from Pharbelos  in  the  Chalkidic  peninsula.  However,  Knoepfler ( 1997)  358  argues  that  Pharbelos  was  a  colony  in  Chalkidike funded  by  Eretrians. 592.  (Phegontioi) Map 50.  Unlocated.  Type:  B:?  Only  the city-ethnic  is  known: (IGi\u00b3263.iii.18), (IG i\u00b3  268.iii.9)  or  (IG i\u00b3  267.ii.27),all  three  vari- ants  known  from  the  Athenian  tribute  lists.  The  singular  of the  city-ethnic  ( []) was restored in SEG  10  53 (c. 430)  but  not  adopted  in  IG i\u00b3  159.Since  the  Phegetians  dis- appear  from  the  tribute  lists  after  432,  it  is  possible  that  they revolted  along  with  Poteidaia  (no. 598),  the  Bottiaians  and the  Chalkidians  in  that  year  (Thuc. 1.58),  and  therefore,  that they  lived  somewhere  on  the  Chalkidic  peninsula,  but  it  can- not  be  determined  with  any  certainty. The  Phegetians  were  members  of  the  Delian  League.  They belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  are  recorded  from 451/0  (IG i\u00b3  262.iii.29)  to  433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.63)  a  total  of  thir- teen  times,  paying  1,600  dr.  from  451/0  (IG i\u00b3  262.iii.29)  to 447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.i.47)  and  thereafter  1,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3 266.ii.33).  The  fact  that  the  Phegontians  did  not  pay  tribute after  432  may  indicate  that  they  took  part  in  the  Revolt  of 432 (Thuc. 1.58.2). 593.  Piloros Map 51.

It  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League,  but  it  is  listed  only once,  in  434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.22),under  the  heading                ( 18\u00ad21,  where polis  is used  in  the  political  sense),  paying  600  dr.  Herodotos  locates it  in  the  bay  of  Singos  along  with  Ass(er)a  (no. 564),  Singos (no. 605)  and  Sarte  (no. 602).  Piloros  supplied  Xerxes  with troops  in  480  (Hdt. 7.122.1). 594.

The  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.17).  In the  Athenian  tribute  lists  Pleume  is  recorded  in  434/3  under the  heading     \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3 278.vi.5\u00ad6,  17,  where polis  is  used  in  the  political  sense),  and in 429/8  under  the  heading         (IG i\u00b3 282.ii.34\u00ad36,  40).  Pleume  may  have  been  a  Bottiaian  polis (Flensted-Jensen  ( 1995)  124\u00ad25).  It is  known exclusively from  the  Athenian  tribute  lists,  where  it  is  recorded  twice (supra),  paying  1,000  dr.  Pleume  is  also  recorded  in  the assessment  decree  of 422/1  (IG i\u00b3  77.v.35). 596.  (Polichnitai) Unlocated,  not  in  Barr. 51.  Type:  C: . No  toponym  is  attested.  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  260.viii.17). The  Polichnitans  were  members  of  the  Delian  League. They  are  recorded  in  the  first two y ears  of  the  tribute  lists, 454/3  and 453/2  (IG i\u00b3  259.v.11\u00ad12,  260.viii.17).  In  the  first year  the  Polichnitans  were  in  a  syntely  with  Stolos  (no. 614) and  Mekyberna  (no. 583),  paying  2  tal.  and  1,880  dr.  They  are also  recorded  (as    ) in the assess- ment  decree  of 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  77.iii.173\u00ad74). The  site  of  the  Polichnitans  has  been  identified t entative- ly  with  modern  Smixi  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1988a)  70\u00ad72),where  a number  of  deeds  of  sale  have  been  found  (SEG 37  575\u00ad76 (C 4m)).  The  name  of  the  month  Demetrion  is  attested  in one  of  them  (SEG 37  576.5).  Moreover,  an  eponymous  priest is  mentioned  in  575.2\u00ad3  (and  possibly  in  576.3\u00ad4;  the  name, as  restored,  is  Euphrantides  son  of  Aristotimos,  who  is  men- tioned  in  a  deed  of  sale  from  Torone,  SEG 24  574.2,  and  who was  perhaps  a  priest  of  the  Chalkidian  Federation). 597.  Posideion  Map 51.  Unlocated,  not  in  Barr.  Type:  C:?  A Posideion  is  known from  the  tribute  assessment  list  of 422/1 (IG i\u00b3  77.v.32).  It  was  assessed  at  1,000  dr.  and  located  in  the Thracian  phoros;  otherwise  its  location  is  unknown.  There were  two  places  in  the  Chalkidic  peninsula  called Pos(e)ideion.  One  is  a  promontory  (modern  ) about 4  km  from  Mende  (and  in  its  territory);  a  sanctuary  of Poseidon  has  been  found  there  (supra 832).  The  other  is mentioned  by  Hdt. 7.115.2  between  Argilos  (no. 554)  and  Akanthos  (no. 559),  probably  the  promontory  c. 20 thrace  from  axios  to  strymon  837 km  north  of  Akanthos  (not  in  Barr.).  However,  Zahrnt  (( 1971) 214)  does  not  believe  that  this  area  could  have  supported  a polis  that  (possibly)  paid  1,000  dr.  to  the  Delian  League. 598.  Poteidaia  (Poteidaiates) Map  50.  Lat. 40.10,long. 23.20.  Size  of  territory: 2.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is ,  (Hdt. 8.126.3;  Thuc. 1.61.3;  IG i\u00b3  268.iii.14)  and later  (Isoc. 15.108;  Ps.-Skylax 66;Diod.  12.46.2). The  city-ethnic  is  (Hdt. 8.129.2), (Thuc. 1.56.2;  IG i\u00b3  272.ii.50),  (ML 27.9  (the  Serpent  Column);  Diod. 12.46.6)  or  (IG ii\u00b2  10109  (C 4m)).  Poteidaia  is  called  a  polis both  in  the  urban  sense  (Thuc. 1.62.1;Aen.Tact.  31.25;  Ps.- Skylax 66)  and  in  the  political  sense  (Thuc. 1.66;Isoc.  15.108; SEG 38  662.4  (C 4f)).  The  collective city-ethnic  is  used  inter- nally  (in  abbreviated  form)  on  C 5\u00adC4  coins  (infra),  and externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  272.ii.50).  The individual  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  a C 4m  sepulchral  inscription  from  Attika  (IG ii\u00b2  10109). At Xen.  Hell. 5.2.39  the  toponym  denotes the  territory  of  Poteidaia.  Thuc. 1.64.2  mentions  that  the  ter- ritory (ge)  of  Poteidaia  was  ravaged  by  Phormion.  Although Poteidaia  was  one  of  the  most  important  poleis  on  the Chalkidic  peninsula,  its  territory  cannot  have  been  larger than  c. 65  km \u00b2,  since  Olynthos  (no. 588)  was  situated  c. 11  km to  the  north,  and  Aphytis  (no. 563)  and  Sane  (no. 600)  c. 14 and 15  km  respectively  to  the  south  of  it.  Furthermore,  the isthmus  of  Pallene  is  900  m  wide  (Strabo  7  fr. 25)  at  its  nar- rowest.  Hdt. 7.123.1  locates  Poteidaia  on  Pallene  next  to Aphytis.  Thuc. 1.56.2  and  Xen.  Hell. 5.2.15  place  it  on  the  isth- mus  of  Pallene. Poteidaia  was  colonised  from  Corinth  (no. 227)  (Thuc. 1.56.2,  66.1),  and  according  to  Nikolaos  of  Damaskos (FGrHist 90)fr.  59,  the  oecist  was  Euagoras,  son  of Periandros.  Thus,  it  was  probably  founded  c. 600.  Annual magistrates  called  \u00b5  were  still  sent  from Corinth  to  Poteidaia  in  C 5s  (Thuc. 1.56.2),  but  there  is  no evidence  that  Poteidaia  was  ruled  from  Corinth  (Graham ( 1964)  135\u00ad37).  Poteidaia  sent  donations  to  Delphi  in  C 6l (Syll. \u00b315;  Alexander  ( 1963)  29\u00ad30),  where  it  also  had  a  treas- ury  (Paus. 10.11.5;Alexander  ( 1963)  25\u00ad29;  Bommelaer  ( 1991) 140\u00ad41). Poteidaia  supplied  troops  and  ships  to  Xerxes  in  480 (Hdt. 7.123.1).  Furthermore,  it  had  300  hoplites  at  Plataiai (Hdt. 9.28.3;ML  27.9  (the  Serpent  Column);  see  Alexander ( 1963)  34\u00ad35;  Paus. 5.23.2  Arist.  Rh. 1396a20).  Apparently Poteidaia  entered  into  an  alliance  with  the  other  towns  of Pallene  against  the  Persians  in  479  (Hdt. 8.128.2). Poteidaia  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League  (Thuc. 1.56.2,  1.66).  It  was  probably  a  member  from  the  very  begin- ning  (it  is  recorded  on  the  Serpent  Column;  see  e.g.  Sealey ( 1966)  243),  but  it  does  not  appear  in  the  tribute  lists  until 446/5  (IG i\u00b3  266.iii.7).  Alexander  ( 1963)  41\u00ad42  suggests  that Poteidaia  supplied  a  quota  of  ships  and  only  later  a  quota  of tribute.  After 446/5  Poteidaia  occurs  regularly  in  the  lists until 433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.70)  a  total  of  eleven  times,  twice completely  restored.  Poteidaia  belonged  to  the  Thracian  dis- trict  and  is  recorded  sometimes  by  toponym  (IG i\u00b3 268.iii.14),sometimes  by  city-ethnic  (IG i\u00b3  272.ii.50),paying a  phoros  of 6  tal.  down to 440/39  (IG i\u00b3  272.ii.50),but  15  tal.  in 433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.70).  It  revolted  in  432  along  with  the Chalkidians  and  the  Bottiaians  (Thuc. 1.58.2),  and  conse- quently  it  is  not  recorded  in  the  complete  panels  of 432/1  and 430/29.  However,  it  appears  from  Thuc. 4.120.3  that  it belonged  to  the  Athenians  in  423. In 432,  the  Athenians  requested  that  Poteidaia  demolish part  of  its  city  wall,  give  hostages  and  refuse  to  accept  the  epi- demiourgoi  from  Corinth  (supra).  Poteidaia  sent  envoys  to Athens  and  Sparta  simultaneously,  and  then  countered  the Athenian  request  by  entering  into  an  alliance  with  the Bottiaians  and  the  Chalkidians  and  revolting  against  the  Athenians  (Thuc. 1.56\u00ad58).Poteidaia  was  besieged  by  the Athenians  from  432  until 430  (Thuc. 1.59\u00ad67,  2.58;  Pl.  Chrm. 153A\u00adB),  when  it  capitulated  (Thuc. 2.70.1\u00ad3).  The  inhabi- tants  left  Poteidaia  and  went  to  Chalkidike  and  other  places (Thuc. 2.70.4;  cf.  Diod. 12.46.6).  The  Athenians  settled Poteidaia  with  1,000  klerouchs  (ML  66:     ;  Thuc. 2.70.4;Diod.  12.46.7),  who  in  IG i\u00b3  62.8, 20  are  referred  to as            .In 423  there  is  evidence  of  stasis  in Poteidaia  (Thuc. 4.121.2),  but  Brasidas'  attempt  to conquer the  city  failed  (Thuc. 4.135.1).  According  to  Xen.  Hell. 5.2.15, 24,  Poteidaia  was  a  member  of  the  Chalkidian  Federation  in the 380s.  In  364/3  Timotheos  captured  Poteidaia  (and Torone  (no. 620))  from  the  Chalkidian  Federation  (Isoc. 15.108,  113;  Din. 1.14,  3.17;Diod.  15.81.6).  Some  pro-Athenian Poteidaians  sent  envoys  to  Athens  to  ask  for  additional  set- tlers,  and  in  362/1  Poteidaia  became  once  again  a  klerouchy (IG ii\u00b2  114  Tod 146)  settled  with  a  contingent  called         (Dem. 7.10).  In 356  Philip  forced  Poteidaia  to  surrender  to  the  Olynthians (no. 588)  (Dem. 6.20,7.10,23.107\u00ad8;cf.Diod.16.8.3\u00ad5).Philip let  the  Athenians  leave  Poteidaia,  but  exposed  the Poteidaians  to  an  andrapodismos:  they  were  sold  off  as slaves,  and  the  town  and  territory  given  to  the  Olynthians (Diod. 16.8.5).  However,  the  city  was  not  destroyed  by  Philip 838 flensted-jensen (Alexander  ( 1963)  91,  pace  West  ( 1918)  133  n. 137).  It  appears from  Dem. 20.61  that  Poteidaia  was  still  in  existence  in  355 and  was  now  a  Makedonian  dependency.  The  presumption is  that  the  town was  given  to a  new  stock  of  settlers,  probably Olynthians  (Hammond  and  Griffith ( 1979)  361).  Paus. 5.23.2 says  that  the  Poteidaians  were  forced  to  leave  their  town twice,  first under the A thenians,  then  under  Philip. Kassandros  brought  them  back  to  Poteidaia  c. 316,but changed  the  name  of  the  town  to  Kassandreia  (Diod. 19.52.2).  We  have  no  information  about  the  status  of Poteidaia  in  the  years  356\u00ad316. Poteidaia  may  have  had  an  oligarchic  constitution,  at  least until 433  (Rhodes  ( 1981)  299). There  is  no  evidence  of  civic  subdivisions  in  Poteidaia, apart  from  Athenian  tribes  and  demes  from  the  time  of  the first klerouchy (AAA 7  ( 1974)  190\u00ad98;  Jones,  POAG 266\u00ad67). Being  an  Athenian  klerouchy  once  again  from  361  to 356, Poteidaia  is  recorded  in  the  Epidaurian  list  of  theorodokoi  of, probably, 360/59  (IG iv\u00b2.194.i.b.12)  and  functioned  as  a (dependent)  polis  as  is  attested  in  a  proxeny  decree  dated  to the  years  359\u00ad357  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1988b)  55\u00ad61  SEG 38 662).  The  inscription  was  found  in  Ag.  Mamas  (between Olynthos  and  Poteidaia)  and  Hatzopoulos  believes  that  it comes  from  Poteidaia  rather  than  Olynthos.  If  that  is  so, there  is  evidence  of  a  boule  (l. 7),  an  ekklesia  (l. 8,  heavily restored)  and  a  tamias  (l. 16),  and  the  community  is  twice referred  to as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  (ll. 4,  13). Thuc. 1.56.2  mentions  the  city  walls  of  Poteidaia. Alexander  ( 1963)  3  writes  that  \"traces  of  ancient  wall  con- struction,  apparently  classical,  were  reported  to  have  been found\",  and  during  recent  excavations  parts  of  the  C 5  walls have  been  found  along  with  C 6  sherds  (ArchDelt 40  ( 1985) Chron. 237\u00ad38;  41  ( 1986)  Chron. 147;  Sismanides  and Kara\u00efskou  ( 1992)  485,  489;  Koussoulakou  ( 1997)  457\u00ad58). Poteidaia  must  have  been  strongly  fortified:  in  479  it  was able  to  withstand  a  siege  for  three  months  (Hdt. 8.126\u00ad28;  cf. Aen.  Tact. 31.25\u00ad27  and  Polyaen. 7.33.1),  and  from  432  it  was besieged  by  the  Athenians  for  2\u0153  years  (Thuc. 2.70). Not  much  of  ancient  Poteidaia  is  left;  much  material  has been  employed  in  later  constructions  (Alexander  ( 1963)  1\u00ad7; cf.  Gomme  ( 1945)  199).  Two  passages  in  Thucydides  suggest that  Poteidaia  had  two  harbours,  one  to  the  east  and  one  to the  west  (Thuc. 1.63,  4.129;  cf.  Alexander  ( 1963)  19).  At some point  in  Antiquity  there  may  have  been  a  canal  through  the isthmus  on  which  Poteidaia  was  situated.  Strabo  says  that  the isthmus  of  Pallene  is  \u00b5  ( 7  fr. 25).  Hdt. 7.22 mentions  the  canal  on  Athos,  but  he  does  not  mention  any canal  on  Pallene,  so  it  may  have  been  dug  later.  There  was  a temple  of  Poseidon  in  the  proasteion  of  Poteidaia  in  479  (Hdt. 8.129.3;  Thuc. 4.129.3).  IG iv  673  is  a  C 4  honorific inscription for  a  Nauplian  victor  in  athletic  contests.  The  name  of Poteidaia  is  restored  in  line  6,  and  if  the  restoration  is  correct, this  is  the  only  known  example  of  games  held  in  Poteidaia. Poteidaia  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Euboic  standard  from c. 550  (Alexander  ( 1953),  ( 1963)  50),  C 6l  (Gaebler  ( 1935) 103\u00ad5;  Robinson  and  Clement  ( 1938)  307;  SNG  Cop. Macedonia 312\u00ad316),  or  c. 500  (Head,  HN \u00b2212)  until  c. 356. Denominations:  tetradrachms,  tetrobols,  diobols  and  tritemoria.  ( 1)  c. 500\u00ad429:  types:  obv.

Others  have female  head  on  the  obv.,  a  sitting  bull and  legend  on  the  rev.  Poteidaia  struck  bronze  coins  in  C 4  as well. 599.  Prassilos  (Prassilios)  Unlocated.  Type:  B:?  The  topo- nym  is (IG i\u00b3  285.iii.10).  Steph.  Byz. 534.11  has (and  the  city-ethnic  ).  The  city-ethnic is  restored  [ ]  in  a  C 4m  inscription  (SEG 40 542.28).Prassilos  may  have  been  located  in  Bottike  (Flensted- Jensen  ( 1995)  124). Prassilos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League,  but  it  is  list- ed  only  once,  in  421/0  (IG i\u00b3  285.iii.10),  paying  900  dr. 600.  Sane  (Sanaios) Map  51.  Lat. 40.20,long.  23.55.  Size  of territory: 2  or 3.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is  ,  (Hdt. 7.22).  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  260.viii.19).  Hdt. 7.22.3  calls  Sane  a  Hellenic  polis  (  `),  using  polis in  the  urban  sense,  whereas  Thuc. 4.109.3\u00ad5  probably  uses polis  in  the  political  sense,  using  polisma  about  the  settle- ment.  The  collective  city-ethnic  is  used  externally  in  the Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  260.viii.19). In C 5  Sane  was  considered  a  colony  from  Andros  (no. 475) (Thuc. 4.109.3).  Plutarch (Mor. 298A),  however,  says  that Sane  was  settled  jointly  by  the  Chalkidians  (no. 365)  and  the Andrians. Sane  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3 259.ii.25,  completely  restored)  to  415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.iii.12)  a total  of  nineteen  times,  four  times  completely  restored,  pay- ing  a  phoros  of 4,000  dr.  from  447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.ii.100)  to  442/1 (IG i\u00b3  270.iii.6).  From  435/4  (IG i\u00b3  277.vi.27)  to  433/2  (IG i\u00b3 279.ii.74)  it  paid  1  tal.,  and  in  430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.ii.27)  just 1,000  dr.  It  is  universally  accepted  that  the  Sane  recorded  in the  tribute  lists  is  Sane  on  Athos.  But  an  inspection  of  its position  in  the  tribute  lists  shows  that  it  may  equally  well  be Sane  (no. 601)  on  Pallene,  thus  Hansen  ( 2004). thrace  from  axios  to  strymon  839 Sane  withstood  an  attack  from  Brasidas  in  424,  but  its  ter- ritory  was  ravaged  (Thuc. 4.109.5).  The  incident  indicates that  Sane  was  fortified.  Sane  is  mentioned  in  the  Peace  of Nikias  (Thuc. 5.18.6).  The  passage  runs  as  follows:            ,  '  .  This  may  be  interpreted  to  mean  that  the Mekybernaians  (no. 583),  the  Sanaians  and  the  Singaians (no. 605)  are  to  live  in  their  own  poleis,  the  Mekybernaians and  the  Singaians  independently  of  Olynthos  (no. 588),  and the  Sanaians  independently  of  Akanthos  (no. 559)  (Gomme ( 1956)  672;  cf.  Hornblower  ( 1996)  478\u00ad79).  Others  want  to emend  the  passage  and  write  instead  of  (West  ( 1937b)  166\u00ad73,  accepted  by  e.g.  Zahrnt  ( 1971)  220). Sane  may  have  been  incorporated  into  Ouranopolis, which  was  founded  by  Alexarchos  c. 315  (Zahrnt  ( 1971) 209\u00ad10),or  perhaps  into  Akanthos,  since  it  is  not  mentioned by  later  sources. South-west  of  modern  Nea  Rhoda  (in  the  territory  of Sane?)  an  Archaic  sanctuary  has  been  found.  The  sanctuary was  in  use  from  the  Archaic  period  to  C 3  (Vokotopoulou and  Tsigarida  ( 1992),  ( 1993);  Tsigarida  ( 1996)). 601.  Sane Map 50.  Lat. 40.05,long.  23.20.  Size  of  territory: 2.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is  ,  (Hdt. 7.123.1).  The city-ethnic  is  not  attested. At 7.123.1  Herodotos  uses  the  pronoun  about  eight poleis  on  Pallene,  and  it  is  an  almost  certain  inference  that the  noun  to  be  supplied  is  .  He  mentions  Sane  after Mende  (no. 584)  and  locates  it  on  Pallene.  Furthermore,  he says  that  it  supplied  ships  and  troops  to  Xerxes  in  480. West  ( 1918)  73  argues  that  Sane  at  Hdt. 7.123.1  must  be  an error  and  that  Sane  on  Pallene  would  have  been  distinguished from  Sane  (no. 600)  on  Akte,  in,  e.g.,  the  Peace  of  Nikias  (see also  Gomme  ( 1956)  588).  This  argument  carries  no  weight; see  supra 839.Furthermore,according  to Strabo  ( 7  fr. 27)  Sane was  one  of  four  poleis  on  Pallene.  Pomponius  Mela  ( 2.3.35) mentions  Sane  too.  Finally,  Geometric  and  Archaic  remains of  a  considerable  settlement  have been  found  on  some  hills near  modern  Sani,  c. 15  km  south  of  Poteidaia  (no. 598) (ArchDelt 41  ( 1986)  Chron. 147,  42  ( 1987)  Chron. 367\u00ad68; Vokotopoulou  ( 1987)  279).  The  fact  that  some  Archaic  sherds are  inscribed  in  the  Corinthian  alphabet  (SEG 38  667)  may indicate  Corinthian  influence,  possibly  via  nearby  Poteidaia, at  Sane;  these  sherds  seem  to  originate  from  the  site  of  a  nocturnal  cult  of  a  female  chthonic  deity  (ibid.).  It  cannot  be precluded  that  the  Sane  recorded  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists is  Sane  on  Pallene,  not  Sane  (no. 600)  on  Athos. 602.  Sarte  (Sartaios) Map  51.

The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  281.iii.57).At  Hdt. 7.122  Sarte  is  twice  called  a  polis,  first in the urban sense;  but the  information  that  Sarte  was  one  of  the  poleis  that  sup- plied  Xerxes  with  troops  in  480  indicates  that  polis  is  used  in the  political  sense  as  well.  In  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  Sarte is  recorded  three  times  under  the  heading  (infra), where polis  is  used  in  the  political  sense.  The  collective city- ethnic  is  used  externally  in  the  tribute  lists  (e.g.  IG i\u00b3 281.iii.57). Hdt. 7.122  locates  Sarte  on  the  bay  of  Singos  and  says  that it  supplied  troops  to  Xerxes  in  480.  Sarte was  a  member  of the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  is recorded in 434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.13),  433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.79)  and in 432/1  (IG i\u00b3  280.ii.71)  under  the  heading   \u00b5,in  430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.iii.57)  and  in  429/8 (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.38)  under  the  heading         [...] \u00b5\u00b5.  It  is  also  on  the  lists  of 421/0  (IG i\u00b3  285.iii.12)  and  415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290. iii.11),  paying  1,500  dr.  from  434/3  to 429/8,but only 100  dr. in 421/0. 603.Serme  (Sermaios) Not  in  Barr 50.  Unlocated.  Type: C:?  The  toponym  is  \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  77.V.20).  The  city-ethnic  is \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  264.iii.34)  or  \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  272.ii.48).It  is restored  as  \u00b5  in  the  tribute  lists  of 443/2  (IG i\u00b3 269.iii.33)  and  442/1  (IG i\u00b3  270.iii.32).  The  collective city- ethnic  is  used  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3 264.iii.34). The  editors  of  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  suggest  that  the Sermaians  were  the  inhabitants  of  Therme  (Hdt. 7.124),  but most  scholars  disagree  (ATL  i. 546,  contra  e.g.  Zahrnt  ( 1971) 223\u00ad25). The  Sermaians  were  members  of  the  Delian  League.  They belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  are  recorded  in  the tribute  lists  from  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.14)  to  432/1  (IG i\u00b3 280.ii.57)  a  total  of  fourteen  times,  twice  completely restored,  paying  500  dr.  They  were assessed  for  tribute  in 422/1  (IG i\u00b3  77.v.20)  500  dr. 604.  Sermylia  (Sermylieus) Map  51.  Lat. 40.15,long. 23.30.  Size  of  territory: 1  or 2.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is \u00b5  (Hdt. 7.122)  or  \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  1184.i.50;  Ps.- Skylax 66).  The  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  277.vi.26), (IG i\u00b3  264.iv.34)  and  on Archaic  coins  (Gaebler  ( 1935)  106\u00ad7).  Sermylia  is  called  a polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Thuc. 1.65.2;  Ps.-Skylax 66  (cf. Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  142))  and  in  the  political 840 flensted-jensen sense  (Thuc. 5.18.8:  Peace  of  Nikias).  At  Hdt. 7.122  polis  is used  in  both  senses  simultaneously  (Hansen  ( 2000a) 175\u00ad76).  Hecat.  fr. 151  (apud  Steph.  Byz. 561.14)  mentioned Sermylia,  although  it  is  not  certain  whether  he  called  it  a polis  (cf.  Hansen  ( 1997b)).  The  collective city-ethnic  is  used internally  on  coins  of  c. 500  (Gaebler  ( 1935)  106\u00ad7)  and  exter- nally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  270.iii.27). Hdt. 7.122  lists  Sermylia  between  Gale(psos)  (no. 571)  and Mekyberna  (no. 583);  Zahrnt  ( 1971)  225  mentions  an  ancient settlement  c. 3  km  south  of  modern  Ormylia.  The  name  of Sermylia's  territory  was  \u00b5  (SEG 38  619.6  (c. 285)). Sermylia  supplied  Xerxes  with  troops  and  ships  in  480 (Hdt. 7.122). Sermylia  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3 259.v.9)  to  434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.v.9)  a  total  of  thirteen  times, once  completely  restored.  In  445/4  it  is  recorded  as \u00b5    (IG i\u00b3  267.ii.25;  see  West  ( 1918)  12  n. 20). In  the  first y ears  it  paid  odd  sums  such  as  4,622  dr.  in  454/3 (IG i\u00b3  259.v.9),  3,550  dr.  in  451/0  (IG i\u00b3  262.ii.28).  In  448/7 and 447/6  it  paid  3  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  264.iv.34,265.ii.29).From  445/4 it  paid  5  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  267.ii.25),  and  from  435/44\u0153  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 277.vi.26).It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.165, completely  restored). In 432  the  Peloponnesians  under  Aristeus  killed  many Sermyliaians  near  their  polis,  and,  since  he  helped  the Chalkidians,  they  must  have  been  enemies  of  the Chalkidians  (Thuc. 1.65.2).  Nevertheless,  the  Chalkidians must  have  secured  control  of  Sermylia  shortly  after,  since they  do  not  appear  in  the  complete  panels  of  the  tribute  lists of 432/1  and 430/29.  However,  it  appears  from  the  Peace  of Nikias  (Thuc. 5.18.8)  that  Sermylia  was  once  again  in  the hands  of  the  Athenians. It seems  reasonable  to infer  that  Sermylia  was  a  member of  the  Chalkidian  Federation  in  C 4  (Zahrnt  ( 1971)  map  4), and  that  it  was  one  of  the  poleis  annihilated  by  Philip  II,  since there  is  no  mention  of  Sermylia  after  348.  Hatzopoulos ( 1996a)  121  suggests  that  it  became  a  kome  of  Kassandreia. Around 285  some  land  in  the  territory of  (the  former  polis?) Sermylia  was  given  to  Limnaios  by  Lysimachos (Hatzopoulos  ( 1988b)  37;  cf.  SEG 38  619). Sermylia  struck  silver  tetradrachms  on  the  Euboic  stand- ard  c. 500  (Head,  HN \u00b2207;  cf.  Gaebler  ( 1935)  106\u00ad7)  or  per- haps  as  early  as  the  third  quarter  of  C 6  (Robinson  and Clement  ( 1938)  313).

Lat. 40.15,long.  23.45.  Size of  territory:  ? Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is  (Hdt. 7.122).  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  260.viii.18)  or (Thuc. 5.18.6).  Singos  is  called  a  polis  at  Hdt. 7.122 in  the  urban  and  political  senses  simultaneously  (Hansen ( 2000a)  175\u00ad76)  and  in  the  political  sense  at  Thuc. 5.18.8 (Peace  of  Nikias).  The  collective  city-ethnic  is  used  external- ly  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  260.viii.18). Singos  supplied  Xerxes  with  troops  in  480  (Hdt. 7.122).  It was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from 454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.v.13)  to  433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.75)  a  total  of  six- teen  times,  once  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of between  1  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.75)  and  4  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.11). Singos  was  assessed  for  tribute  of 10  dr.  in  421  (IG i\u00b3  77.v.22), and  possibly  in  425/4  too  (IG i\u00b3  71.iv.109,  completely restored). In  the  Peace  of  Nikias  it  is  stipulated  that  the  inhabitants of  Singos  live in  their  own  polis  (Thuc. 5.18.6),  which  proba- bly  means  that  Singos  was  one  of  the  poleis  that  took  part  in the  synoecism  of  Olynthos  (no. 588)  in  432  (Thuc. 1.58.2;see West  ( 1918)  74  and  Hornblower  ( 1996)  478\u00ad79);  the  wording of  Thuc. 1.58.2  ( ... and   ) suggests that the city was destroyed  in  connection  with  the  synoecism.  Perhaps  Singos was  one  of  the  towns  destroyed  by  Philip  II,  since  Strabo calls  it  a      \u00b5\u00b5  ( 7  fr. 31).Remains  of the  urban  centre  and  its  harbour  have  been  found  near modern  Ag.  Nikolaos;  the  urban  centre  was  protected  by  a wall  of  the  Classical  or  Hellenistic  period  (Zahrnt  ( 1971) 227\u00ad28). 606.  Sinos Map 50.  Lat. 40.15,long.  23.45.

In  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  Sinos  is  twice  record- ed  under  the  heading              ,in  434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.18\u00ad21,  24)  and  in  433/2 (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.89\u00ad92,  98,  restored),  where  polis  is  used  in  the political  sense.  The  name  of  the  territory, ,  is  men- tioned  in  Syll. \u00b3332  ( 306\u00ad297),  according  to  which  a  field in the  Sinaia  was  given  by  Kassandros  to  Perdikkas.  Sinos  may have  been  situated  in  Bottike  (Flensted-Jensen  ( 1995)  125). Sinos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  for the  years  434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.24),  433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.98)  and 421/0  (IG i\u00b3  285.iii.9),  paying  1,500  dr.  in  434/3  and 433/2  and 800  dr.  in  421/0.

The  toponym  is  presumably (Theopomp.  fr. 151;  cf.  Knoepfler ( 1997)  358  with n. 49).  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  263.iii.16).  The collective  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  the  Athenian tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  259.v.6\u00ad7). Theopomp.  fr. 151  describes  Skabala  as  a   ',which indicates that he took it to  be  a  colony  of Eretria  (Knoepfler ( 1997)  358  with  n. 49). The  Skablaians  were  members  of  the  Delian  League.  They are  recorded  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.v.6\u00ad7)  to  433/2  (IG i\u00b3 279.ii.71)  a  total  of  fourteen  times,  once  completely  restored. In  the  first y ear  (IG i\u00b3  259.v.6\u00ad7  ( 454/3))  they  appear  in  a syntelic  group  along  with  Olynthos  (no. 588)  and  Ass(er)a (no. 564),  paying  2  tal., 4,000  dr.  altogether.  When  the Skablaians  are  listed  alone,  they  pay  either  3,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3 263.iii.16)  or  2,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  266.ii.25)  or,  once, 1,500  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.71).  Since  they  are  absent  from  the  full  panel  of 430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.ii.5\u00ad27),  many  scholars  believe  that  the Skablaians  revolted  in  432  (Zahrnt  ( 1971)  231).  This,  and  the  fact  that  they  paid  along  with  Olynthos  and  Ass(er)a,  led the  editors  of  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  to  believe  that  the Skablaians  lived  north  of  Sithonia  (ATL  i. 549). 608.  (Skapsaioi) Unlocated.  Type:  B: ? The city-ethnic is (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.49).  The  abbreviated  collective city-ethnic  is  used  internally  on  C 4f  coins  (infra)  and  exter- nally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  290.iii.13). The  Skapsaians  were  members  of  the  Delian  League. They  belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  are  recorded  in the  tribute  lists  from  452/1  (IG i\u00b3  261.ii.6,heavily  restored)  to 415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.iii.13)  a  total  of  fourteen  times,  once  com- pletely  restored.  However,  they  are  not  listed  in  the  complete panel  of 430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.ii.5\u00ad27),  which  may  indicate  that they  took  part  in  the  Revolt  of 432  (Thuc. 1.58.2).  If  so,  they must  have  joined  the  Athenians  again  at  some  point  before 415.  The  Skapsaians  paid  a  phoros  of 1,000  dr. During  the  excavations  at  Olynthos  a  Skapsaian  bronze coin  was  found.  It  dates  from  C 4f.

Lat. 39.55,long.  23.35. Size of  territory: 2.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is  , (Thuc. 4.120.2)  or  (IG iv\u00b2.1i.b.94.25  ( 359)).  The city-ethnic  is  (Thuc. 4.120.1;  IG i\u00b3  266.ii.31). Skione  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Thuc. 4.131.1; Ps.-Skylax 66,  where  it  is  listed  under  the  heading   ) and in the political sense (Hdt. 8.128.3;  Thuc. 4.122.4, 5.18.8:  Peace  of  Nikias).  Thuc. 5.2.1  once  describes  Skione  as a  chorion  in  Thrace.  The  collective city-ethnic  is  used  inter- nally  on  C 5f  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2210),  and  externally  in  the Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  266.ii.31).  The  individual  and external  use  is  attested  in  Attic  sepulchral  inscriptions  (IG ii\u00b2  10365\u00ad66  (C 4))  and  in  literary  sources  (Hdt. 8.8.1). Hdt. 7.123,  locates  Skione  between  Therambos  (no. 616) and  Mende  (no. 584)  on  Pallene  (cf.  Thuc. 4.120.1). Skione  supplied  troops  and  ships  to  Xerxes  in  480  (Hdt. 7.123).Hdt.8.128.1\u00ad3  mentions  a  strategos  from  Skione  in  ref- erence  to 479.  Skione  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  in  the Athenian  tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.ii.9)  to  429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.12)  a  total  of  fourteen  times.  In  the  years  454/3\u00ad451/0 Skione  and  Therambos  (no. 616)  paid  jointly  6  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 262.i.3);  in  the  following  period  Skione  paid  6  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 266.ii.31)  until  432/1,  when  the  tribute  was  lowered  to 4  tal. (IG i\u00b3  280.ii.52),  but  in  430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.ii.14)  and  in  429/8 (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.12)  it  paid  9  tal. Skione  joined  Brasidas  in  423  (Thuc. 4.120\u00ad21;  cf.  Diod. 12.72.1),  just  after  Athens  and  Sparta  had  concluded  an armistice  for  a  year  (Thuc. 4.117\u00ad19).  Therefore,  on  the motion  of  Kleon,  the  Athenians  decreed  that  Skione  be destroyed  and  the  inhabitants  killed  (Thuc. 4.122.6).  Having captured  Mende,  the  Athenians  laid  siege  to  Skione  and built  a  wall  round  the  city  (Thuc. 4.130.7\u00ad132.1,  133.4,  5.2.2; Ar.  Vesp. 210).  In  the  Peace  of  Nikias  Skione  is  ceded  to Athens  (Thuc. 5.18.7\u00ad8).  Shortly  after,  the  Athenians  cap- tured  Skione  and  exposed  the  city  to  andrapodismos:  the adult  males  were  killed,  the  women  and  the  children enslaved,  and  the  land  given  to  the  Plataians  (Thuc. 5.32.1; Isoc. 4.109)--in later sources described as a harsh t reatment (Xen.  Hell. 2.2.3;Isoc.  4.100).  In  405/4  Lysander  gave Skione back  to its  former  inhabitants  (Plut.  Lys. 14.3;  cf.  Xen.  Hell. 2.2.3,  9).  Skione  is  recorded  in  the  Epidaurian  list  of  theo- rodokoi  of 360/59  (IG iv\u00b2.194.i.b.25). Meritt  ( 1923)  450\u00ad51  offers  a  description  of  the  site  of Skione.  He  located  the  acropolis  of  Skione  on  a  fortified hill (p. 447)  from  which  C 4  remains  of  a  building  have  been reported (ArchDelt 41  ( 1986)  Chron. 149),  and  later  excava- tions  have  revealed  remains  of,  inter  alia,  a  large  C 5  building, built  in  isodomic  masonry  (Sismanides  ( 1991)). The  Skionaians  believed  that,  originally,  they  came  from Pellene  in  the  Peloponnese.  The  first settlers w ere  driven  by  a storm  on  their  way  back  from  Troy (Thuc. 4.120.1;  cf. Polyaen. 7.47).  Borza  ( 1990)  75  suggests  that  Achaians  settled at  Skione.  This  tradition  is  undoubtedly  an  attempt  to  con- nect  Peloponnesian  Pellene  with  Thracian  Pallene,  on  which 842 flensted-jensen Skione  was  located.  An  Archaic  coin  testifies t o  a  different tradition:  on  the  obverse  Protesilaos  is  celebrated  as  the oecist  of  Skione  (Kraay  ( 1976)  134  with  no. 470).  The  two  tra- ditions  are  not  mutually  exclusive:  \"Protesilaos  the  `Achaian' (in  the  broad  Homeric  sense)  is  easily  reconcilable  with  the story  of  a  foundation  from  Achaia  (in  the  narrow  geograph- ical  sense  of Achaia,  i.e.  northern  Peloponnese)\" (Hornblower  ( 1996)  377\u00ad78).  Skione  was  considered  an Achaian  colony  by later  writers:  Pomponius  Mela  2.33  and Polyaen. 7.47  both  say  that  Skione  was  founded  by  Achaians escaping  from  Troy,  whereas  Konon  ( 13  Phot. 133a)  attrib- utes  the  foundation  of  Skione  to  Protesilaos.  However,  it  was well  known  that  Protesilaos  was  killed  as  soon  as  he  arrived  at Troy (Hom.  Il. 2.698\u00ad702).Various  solutions  to this  problem have  been  suggested:  Protesilaos  participated  in  the  first expedition  against  Troy  (with  Herakles)  and  founded  Skione after  that  expedition  (Hornblower  ( 1996)  377  with  refs.);  or there  may  have  been  an  alternative  tradition  according  to which  Protesilaos  did  not  die  when  he  arrived  at  Troy,  and thus  was  able  to  found  Skione  (Boedeker  ( 1988)  36  n. 22). Skione  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Euboic  standard  from C 6l  to  c. 450,  and  on  the  Phoenician  standard  before  c. 424.

Skithai  (Skithaios) Not  in  Barr.  Unlocated.  Type: B: .  The  toponym  is  (Steph.  Byz. 574.17).  The  city- ethnic  is  (Theopomp.  fr. 375), () found  on  coins  (SNG  Cop.  Macedonia 325).Steph.Byz.574.17 describes  Skithai  as  a  polis  in  Thrace,  in  the  vicinity  of Poteidaia  (  ). Since  he  calls  Skithai  a polis  in  Thrace,  not  in  Makedonia,  he  probably  used  a  pre- 350  source.  Skithai  is  sometimes  identified w ith  Kithas  (s.v.; Gaebler  ( 1929)  256;  but  see  Flensted-Jensen  ( 1997)  125\u00ad27). Skithai  minted  silver  coins  c. 500.

Smila Map 50.  Unlocated.  Type:  A:?  The  toponym  is \u00b5  (Hecat.  fr. 148;  Hdt. 7.123.2)  or  \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3 278.vi.31).  Apart  from  Steph.  Byz. 580.10,  there  is  no  attesta- tion  of  a  city-ethnic.  Smila  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense by  Hecat.  fr. 148  (Hansen  ( 1997b)  25),  and  in  the  urban  and political  sense  combined  (Hansen  ( 2000a)  175\u00ad76)  by  Hdt. 7.123.2\u00ad3.  In  an  Athenian  tribute  list  Smila  is  recorded  under the  heading            (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.18\u00ad21,  31),  where  polis  is  used  in  the political  sense.  Hdt. 7.123.2\u00ad3  locates  Smila  in  Krousis. Smila  supplied  Xerxes  with  troops  in  480  (Hdt. 7.123.2).  It was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League,  but  is  listed  only  once, in 434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.ii.31),  paying  3,000  dr.  along  with  the Tindaians  (no. 619),  Kithas  (no. 579),  Gigonos  (no. 572)  and Haisa  (no. 573).  [ \u00b5] is restored in IG  i\u00b3  71.iv.84 ( 425/4). 612.  Spartolos  (Spartolios) Map  50.  Lat. 40.20;long. 23.10.  Size  of  territory:  ?  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is , (Thuc. 2.79.2).  The  city-ethnic  is (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.24).  Spartolos  is  called  a  polis both  in  the  urban  sense  (Thuc. 2.79.2)  and  in  the  political sense  (Thuc. 2.79.2,  5.18.5:  Peace  of  Nikias).  The  collective city-ethnic  is  used  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.24). Spartolos  was  a  polis  in  Bottike  (Thuc. 2.79.2;Harp. 34). The  name  of  its  territory was  probably  also   (Syll. \u00b3332.15\u00ad16  ( 306\u00ad297);  cf.  Flensted-Jensen  ( 1995)  125). Spartolos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League  until  the beginning  of  the  Peloponnesian  War.  It  belonged  to  the Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from 454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.24)  to  434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.v.5)  a  total  of  six- teen  times,  once  completely  restored,  paying  2  tal.  each  year, except  in 434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.v.5)  and  433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.73), when  it  paid  3  tal. 500  dr.  In  432  the  Bottiaians  revolted against  the  Athenians  (Thuc. 1.57.5),  and  in  429  they  fought and  won  a  battle  against  the  Athenians  outside  Spartolos (Thuc. 2.79.2\u00ad7;Isae.  5.42;  Flensted-Jensen  ( 1995)  121\u00ad22). Spartolos  may  have  been  listed  in  the  assessment  decree  of 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.167: []).  According  to  the Peace  of  Nikias,  Spartolos  was  to  be  autonomos  and  pay  the tribute  as  fixed b y  Aristeides  (Thuc. 5.18.5). A  C 4m  deed  of  sale  has  been  found  at  the  presumed  site  of Spartolos  (Papangelos  ( 1996)).  The  inscription  indicates that  Spartolos  was  a  member  of  the  Chalkidian  Federation at  that  time,  since  Aristoboulos,  son  of  Kallikrates  (ll. 1\u00ad2), was  a  priest  of  the  Chalkidian  Federation,  perhaps  in  353/2 (Hatzopoulos  ( 1988a)  59,  67,  73\u00ad75). It  appears  from  Thuc. 2.79  that  Spartolos  was  walled. At  the  presumed  site  of  Spartolos  there  are  remains  of  a thrace  from  axios  to  strymon  843 cemetery  containing  graves  from  the  Archaic  and  Classical periods  and  of  a  settlement.  Furthermore,  excavations  at Nea  Syllata,  c. 3  km  from  ancient  Spartolos,  show  continuous habitation  from  the  Bronze  Age,  through  the  Classical, Roman  and  Byzantine  periods  (ArchDelt 31  ( 1976)  Chron. 247);  also  a  cemetery  has  been  found  at  Nea  Syllata  (AAA 14 ( 1982)  246\u00ad50). 613.  Stagiros  (Stagirites) Map  51.  Lat. 40.35,long.  23.45. Size of  territory:  ? Type:  A: .  The  older  toponym  is (Hdt. 7.115.2;  Thuc. 4.88.2)  or  (IG iv\u00b2.1 94.i.b.21  ( 360/59)),  and  the  later  one  is  ,  (Dion. Hal.  Ad Amm. 1.5)  or  (Strabo  7  fr. 33  (but  note ,fr.  35)).  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3 271.ii.53),  and  later  (Diod. 18.8.3;  Dio  Chrys. 47.9).  Herodotos  calls  Stagiros  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense (  `:  7.115.2),  and  Thucydides  in  the  political sense  ( 5.18.5:  Peace  of  Nikias).  The  collective  city-ethnic  is found  internally  in  abbreviated  form  on  C 6l  coins  (infra), and  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  281.ii.18). The  individual  city-ethnic  is  used  externally  on  a  gravestone from  Athens  (IG i\u00b3  1370  (C 5s))  and  in  Syll. \u00b3275  ( 334\u00ad332). According  to  early  tradition,  Stagiros  was  a  colony  from Andros  (Thuc. 4.88.2,  5.6.1),  but  Dion.  Hal.  Ad Amm. 1.5 seems  to  believe  that  it  was  founded  from  Chalkis  (no. 365). Hdt. 7.115.2  mentions  Stagiros  in  connection  with  Xerxes' march  in  480.  Stagiros  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League. It  belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  from 454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.i.14)  to  429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.10)  a  total  of  fifteen times,  once  completely  restored,  paying  1,000  dr.  in  all  years (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.15).In  424  Stagiros  revolted  and  joined  Brasidas (Thuc. 4.88.2),  and  in  422  Kleon  made  an  unsuccessful attack  on  the  city  (Thuc. 5.6.1).  In  the  Peace  of  Nikias Stagiros  is  declared  autonomos  and  liable  to the  tribute assessed  by  Aristeides  (Thuc. 5.18.5).  It  was  assessed  for  trib- ute  in  410/9  (Krateros  fr. 25  (Krech  1888)  IG i\u00b3  100).  If  we can  trust  some  late  sources  (Tzetzes,  Chil. 7.441,  11.849;Dio Chrys. 47.9),  Stagiros  had  been  a  polis  (or  kome)  in Olynthian  territory,  i.e.  a  member  of  the  Chalkidic Federation  (Zahrnt  ( 1971)  242\u00ad43).  According  to  an  emend- ed  passage  in  Diod. 16.52.9  and  two  passages  from  Vit.  Arist. (fr. 655,  Rose),  Stagiros  was  destroyed  by  Philip  in  348  (see Hammond  and  Griffith ( 1979)  376  and  Hatzopoulos  ( 1996a) 191).  It is  not  clear  from  Plut.  Alex. 7.2  and  Dio  Chrys. 47.9 whether  the  town  was  in  fact  destroyed;  what  is  clear  is  that the  population  was  expelled  and  later  allowed  to  move  back. Excavations  show  that  the  site  of  Stagiros  was  fortified in the Hellenistic  period  (see  infra). Stagiros  is  recorded  in  the  Epidaurian  list  of  theorodokoi of 360/59  (IG iv\u00b2.194.i.b.21).  The  most  famous  citizen  of Stagiros,  Aristotle,  was  praised  by  the  Delphic  Amphiktyony in 334/3  (Syll. \u00b3275). Excavations  were  begun  in  1990.  The  city  was  situated  on a  promontory  consisting  of  two  hills.  The  earliest  settlement was  located  on  the  northern  hill.  When  the  town  expanded in  the  Classical  period,  building  was  begun  on  the  southern hill  as  well,  and  both  hills  were  surrounded  by  a  wall,  which is  very  well  preserved,  especially  on  the  southern  side.  The wall  is  built  in  various  types  of  masonry  (Lesbian  and  polyg- onal)  and  has  an  estimated  length  of 1.5\u00ad2  km,  with  both square  and  circular  towers.  It  is  about  2  m  in  width.  The building  of  the  wall  was  begun  c. 500  (Sismanides  ( 1997)  5;  cf. Sismanides  ( 1991);  BCH 118  ( 1994)  762;  Sismanides  ( 1996) 279\u00ad80;  Camp  ( 2000)  44). On  the  north-east  part  of  the  northern  hill  there  is  a  150  m zigzag  stretch  of  a  wall  built  in  the  late  Classical  period,  pre- sumably  after  Philip  II  destroyed  the  town  (Sismanides ( 1996)  280). On  the  northern  hill  there  are  remains  of  a  complex  from the  Byzantine  period.  Remains  of  the  Archaic  wall  was found  in  this  complex,  along  with  a  C 6  lintel  with  a  C 6 inscription,  which  seems  to  be  some  kind  of  tax  regulation, imposing  a  tax  of 5  dr.  (autopsy). On  the  northern  hill,  where  the  oldest  settlement  was located,  three  Archaic  sanctuaries  have  been  found.  One, which  is  situated  close  to  the  sea,  may  have  been  for Demeter.  In  connection  with  this  sanctuary,  many  frag- ments  of  female  clay  protomes  have been  found;  the  other sanctuary  is  a  circular  structure, 11  m  in  diameter,  which  is probably  a  Thesmophorion  (Sismanides  ( 1997)  19).  The third  one  is  situated  closer  to  the  top  of  the  hill.  The  divinity worshipped  in  this  temple  has  not  been  identified.  Theophr. Hist.  Pl. 4.16.3  refers  to a  Mouseion  in  Stagiros,  but  it  may have  been  located  on  the  southern  hill. Between  the  two  hills  is  a  depression,  where  the  agora  was situated.  On  the  agora  a  C 4  stoa, 6  26  m,  has  been  found. It  is  built  in  pseudo-isodomic  masonry.  Only  the  marble bases  of  the  columns  survive.  Near  the  agora  is  a  paved  road, 3  m  wide.  A  stretch  of 30  m  has  been  located  so  far. Furthermore,  there  are  remains  of  commercial  buildings, such  as  shops,  store-rooms  and  a  wine  vat  (Sismanides ( 1996)  286\u00ad87,(1997)  12,  14). On  top  of  the  southern  hill  are  the  remains  of  the  trian- gular  acropolis.  One  of  the  sides  is  formed  by  the  Classical wall,  and  on  this  side  there  is  also  a  small  gate.  Opposite  the gate  is  a  cistern.  The  walls  surrounding  the  acropolis  are  844 flensted-jensen preserved,  in  some  places  very  well,  with  flights of  internal steps,  etc.  On  the  north-west  corner  there  is  also  a  watch- tower.  Remains  of  water  pipes  are  preserved  in  situ,  and about  forty  have  been  found  so  far  (Sismanides  ( 1996)  284). On  both  hills  remains  of  dwellings  have  been  found,  dat- ing  to  the  Archaic,  Classical  and  Hellenistic  periods (Sismanides  ( 1996)  285\u00ad86). Stagiros  struck  silver  staters  on  the  Euboic  standard  from C 6l.  Types:  obv.  lion  and  boar;  rev.  incuse  square,  or  obv. wild  sow;  rev.  incuse  square;  legend: .

The  toponym  is  (IG iv\u00b2.1 94.i.b.23  ( 360/59);  Steph.  Byz. 588.18)  or  ,  (Thuc. 5.18.5;Strabo 9.2.23;  Eust.  Il. 2.497).  The  city-ethnic  is (e.g.  IG i\u00b3  259.v.11). Stolos  is  referred  to as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  in  three C 4  deeds  of  sale  (SEG 38  670.4,  671.7,  672.4;  cf.  infra).  It  is called  polis  in  the  political  sense  at  Thuc. 5.18.5  (Peace  of Nikias).  The  city-ethnic  is  used  externally  in  the  Athenian tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  259.v.11). West  ( 1937a)  166  thinks  Stolos  must  be  located  in  the  inte- rior  of  the  Chalkidic  peninsula,  west  of  Akanthos  (no. 559). Hatzopoulos  ( 1988a)  70\u00ad72  tentatively  identifies Stolos w ith modern  Kellion,  where  a  number  of  deeds  of  sale  have  been found  (SEG 38  670\u00ad73  (C 4m)).  According  to  Sismanides, however,  there  was  \"an  unknown,  but  important  ancient town\"  at  Kellion;  building  debris  has  been  found  there (ArchDelt 41  ( 1986)  Chron. 150). Stolos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3 259.v.11)  to  434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.3)  a  total  of  fourteen  times.  In the  first y ear  Stolos  paid  in  a  syntely  with  the  Polichnitans (no. 596)  and  Mekyberna  (no. 583).  After  that,  it  paid  4,000 dr.  in  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.17),  5,000  dr.  in  448/7  (IG i\u00b3 264.iii.2)  and  447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.ii.32),  and  again  4,000  dr. from  445/4  (IG i\u00b3  267.ii.26).  In  438/7  and 434/3  Stolos  paid  1 tal.  (IG i\u00b3  274.vi.12,  278.vi.3).  According  to  the  Peace  of Nikias,  Stolos  was  to  be  autonomos  and  pay  the  tribute  as fixed b y  Aristeides  (Thuc. 5.18.5). Stolos  may  have  been  a  member  of  the  Chalkidian Federation,  at  least  in  C 4.  Hatzopoulos  ( 1996a)  388\u00ad89 argues  that  Stolos  must  have  been  a  member  of  the Chalkidian  Federation,  since  it  is  evident  from  a  number  of C 4m  deeds  of  sale  that  Stolos  used  the  calendar  also  in  use  at Olynthos  (no. 588).  Four  month  names  are  known  from C 4m  deeds  of  sale  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1988a)  65\u00ad66,  80;  Tr\u00fcmpy, Monat. 42\u00ad43). Steph.  Byz. 588.18\u00ad20,  without  quoting  any  source, reports  that  Stolos  originally  was  an  Edonian  town,  which was  later  taken  over  by  the  Chalkidians. 615.  Strepsa  (Strepsaios) Map  50.  Lat. 40.30,long.  23.10. Size of  territory:  ? Type:  B: .  The  toponym  is  , (Aeschin. 2.27).  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3 259.iv.14;  Ar.  fr. 126,  PCG).  Harp. 44,quoting Hellan.fr.  61, classifies Strepsa as a polis  in  Thrace  (    ).  Hellanikos  was  obviously  Harpokration's  source for  the  location,  but  not  necessarily  for  the  site- classification.  Strepsa's  status  as  a  polis  is  indicated  by  its membership  of  the  Delian  League  combined  with  the  evid- ence  that  Strepsa  was  a  nucleated  settlement.  The  collective city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.14). The  location  of  Strepsa  has  been  the  subject  of  consider- able  scholarly  discussion  (Hatzopoulos  and  Loukopoulou ( 1987)  59;  cf.  Gomme  ( 1956)  215\u00ad18;  Edson  ( 1955);  Borza ( 1990)  294\u00ad95).Hatzopoulos  and  Loukopoulou  suggest  that Strepsa  be  identified w ith  modern  Vasilika  (cf.  AR  ( 1986\u00ad87) 34;  Papazoglou  ( 1988)  202\u00ad3;  cf.  Hammond  ( 1972)  190\u00ad91). Not  far  from  that,  at  modern  Ag.  Paraskevi,  a  large  C 6  ceme- tery  containing  c. 500  graves  has  been  excavated  in  the  per- iod 1981\u00ad88.  All  the  female  burials  faced  east,  and  the  male west  (as  in  nearby  Thermi).  Men  were  buried  with  weapons, and  women  with  jewellery.  A  large  amount  of  vessels  have been  recovered,  both  imported  and  local  ware,  and  virtually all  types  are  represented  (Sismanides  ( 1987);  Macedonians ( 1994)  170  with  photos  177\u00ad93).  The  degree  of  organisation seems  to  show  that  the  cemetery  was  part  of  an  organised community,  not  just  the  result  of  private  enterprise.  The cemetery  was  remarkably  rich,  and  it  is  noteworthy  that weapons  were  found  in  a  period  when  they  were  no  longer used  as  grave-offerings  in  Attika  (Kurtz  and  Boardman ( 1971)  75).  Traces  of  the  settlement  to  which  the  cemetery belonged  were  found  nearby  (ArchDelt 41  ( 1986)  Chron. 139).  At  Souroti  in  the  vicinity  two  C 4  graves  have  been found  (ArchDelt 29  ( 1973\u00ad74)  Chron. 697),  and  a  further eight  C 6l\u00adC4l  graves  were  excavated  in  1999  (Souereph  and Havela ( 2001)). The  name  of  Strepsa's  territory  was  (SEG 38 619.17  (C 3e)).  In  285  King  Lysimachos  gave  to  Limnaios   [ ]      (ibid.).  It  appears  from  the inscription  that  Limnaios  was  also  given  land  in  Sermyliaia and  in  Olynthia.  Those  two  districts  were  indisputably  quite thrace  from  axios  to  strymon  845 close  to  each  other,  and  Strepsaia  seems  to  have  been  situat- ed  in  the  same  area  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1988b)).  A  fragmentary C 4  deed  of  sale  is  from  Vasilika,  supposedly  ancient  Strepsa (SEG 37  583). It  is  mentioned  again  in  connection  with  Kallias'  march from  Pydna  (no. 544)  to  Poteidaia  (no. 598)  in  432  (Thuc. 1.61.4,  if  indeed  Pluygers'  emendation  of is correct),  and  once  more  in  368  when  the  pretender Pausanias  seized  Strepsa  along  with  Anthemous  (no. 562) and  Therme  (no. 552)  (Aeschin. 2.27). Strepsa  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3 259.iv.14)  to  433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.68)  a  total  of  sixteen  times, paying  1  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  277.vi.9).It  is  absent  from  the  full  panel  of 430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.ii.5\u00ad27),  which  indicates  that  it  may  have participated  in  the  Revolt  of 432. 616.  Therambos  (Thrambaios) Map  51.  Lat. 39.55,long. 23.40.  Size  of  territory: 2.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is \u00b5  (Hdt. 7.123.1)  or  \u00b5  (Ps.-Skylax  66). The  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  62.6)  and  perhaps \u00b5  (Krateros  fr. 25  (Krech  1888)).  Therambos  is probably  the  \u00b5  of  Steph.  Byz. 586.11.  Furthermore, he  mentions  a  \u00b5,   (317.5). Ps.-Skylax 66  lists  Therambos  as  the  fourth  toponym  after the  heading   ,  where polis  is  used  in  the  urban sense.  At 7.123.1  Herodotos  uses  the  pronoun  about Therambos  and  seven  other  poleis  on  Pallene,  and  it  is  an almost  certain  inference  that  the  noun  to  be  supplied  is .That Therambos was a polis  in  the  political  sense  too is  indicated  by its  membership  of  the  Delian  League  and,  if correctly  restored,  by  IG i\u00b3  62.6: \u00b5  ...  [  ],where the city-ethnic is attested in its collec- tive  and  external  sense.  Hdt. 7.123.1  locates  Therambos  on Pallene  between  Aige  (no. 556)  and  Skione  (no. 609). Therambos  supplied  Xerxes  with  troops  and  ships  in  480 (Hdt. 7.123.1).Therambos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League. It  belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  trib- ute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.ii.10)  to  429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.8)  a total  of  sixteen  times,  once  completely  restored.  In  the  first years  Therambos  paid  jointly  with  Skione;  from  446/5  it  paid alone  a  phoros  of 1,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  266.ii.32).  It  was  also  assessed (IG i\u00b3  100;  Krateros  fr. 25  (Krech  1888)).  Apparently Therambos  supported  the  (Athenian?)  archontes  present  at Aphytis  (no. 563)  c. 428  (IG i\u00b3  62.6,  cf.  Meritt  ( 1944)  217). 617.  Thestoros Not  in  Barr.  Unlocated.  Type:  C:?  The toponym is (IG i\u00b3  77.v.36;  Theopomp.  fr. 142). Apart  from  Steph.  Byz. 312.14,there  is  no  attestation  of  a  city- ethnic.  Steph.  Byz.  classifies Thestoros as a  ... \u00b5 \u017d.We cannot know,however,whether the site-classification stems from Theopompos (Hansen ( 2000b)  141\u00ad42).  The  editors  of  the  Athenian  tribute  lists assume  that  Thestoros  may  have  been  located  \"in  the Olynthian  territory\",  since  the  fragment  of  Theopompos' Philippika  in  which  Thestoros  is  mentioned  deals  with  the C 4m  war  between  Philip  and  Olynthos  (no. 588  (ATL  i. 490; cf.  Shrimpton  ( 1991)  61).  Thestoros  is  recorded  in  the Athenian  assessment  decree  of 422/1  (IG i\u00b3  77.v.36),  but  not in  any  of  the  tribute  lists.  It was  presumably  a  member  of  the Delian  League,  or  at  least  the  Athenians  claimed  that  it  was. 618.  Thyssos  (Thyssios) Map  51.  Lat. 40.15,long.  24.10. Size of  territory:  ? Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is  (Hdt. 7.22.3;Strabo 7  fr. 35)  or  ,  (Thuc. 5.35.1).  The  city- ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  261.iv.7  ( 422/1)). Hdt. 7.22.3  and  Ps.-Skylax  66  (Flensted-Jensen  and Hansen  ( 1996)  142)  call  Thyssos  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense, whereas  Thuc. 4.109.3\u00ad5  probably  uses  the  word  in  the  polit- ical  sense,  using  polisma  about  the  settlement.  The  collective city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists (IG i\u00b3  261.iv.7).  Thyssos  was  located  on  Athos  (Hdt. 7.22; Thuc. 4.109). Thyssos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League  (cf.  Thuc. 5.35.1).  It  belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.ii.14)  to  429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.25)  a  total  of seventeen  times,  twice  completely  restored,  paying  4,000  dr. from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.ii.14,restored)  to 451/0  (IG i\u00b3  262.ii.29), 1\u0153  tal.  from  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.iii.23)  and  1  tal.  from  446/5  (IG i\u00b3  266.ii.11)  to  429/8.  Thyssos  was  assessed  for  tribute  in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.175).  In  424/3  Thyssos  joined  Brasidas (Thuc. 4.109.5),  but  it  must  have  become  a  member  of  the League  again  shortly  after,  because  it  was  allied  with  Athens in 421  when  it  was  captured  by  Dion  (Thuc. 5.35.1). Thuc. 4.109.4  says  that  Thyssos  had  a  mixed  (i.e.  barbar- ian\u00adHellenic)  bilingual  population,  but  about  a  century later  Ps.-Skylax  66  calls  it  a  &lt;polis&gt; Hellenis  (Flensted- Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  151). 619.  Tinde  (Tindaios) Map  50.Lat.40.25,long.23.00.Size of  territory:  ?  Type:  A:?  The  toponym  is  ,  known only from  Steph.  Byz. 624.18.  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3 278.vi.29).  In  an  Athenian  tribute  list,  the  Tindaioi  are recorded  under  the  heading              (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.18\u00ad21,29,where polis is  used  in  the  political  sense),  attesting  to  the  collective  and external  use  of  the  city-ethnic.  Tinde  may  have  been  a Bottiaian  polis  (Flensted-Jensen  ( 1995)  123). 846 flensted-jensen Tinde  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League,  but  it  is recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  only  once:  viz.in 434/3  (IG i\u00b3 278.vi.29),  paying  3,000  dr.  together  with  Kithas  (no. 579), Gigonos  (no. 572)  and  Haisa  (no. 573).  Perhaps  Tinde  was also  listed  in  the  assessment  decree  of 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iv.83, completely  restored). 620.  Torone  (Toronaios) Map  51.  Lat. 40.00,long.  23.55. Size of  territory: 3.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is  , (Hdt. 7.122;  Thuc. 4.129.1).  The  adjective  occurs in  Archil.  fr. 89.20,  West,  which  implies  that  the  toponym antedates  C 7m.  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3 266.ii.28;  IG ii\u00b2  10454)  or  on  C 5  coinage (Head,  HN \u00b2207). Torone  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  (Hdt. 7.122; Thuc. 4.110\u00ad14;  Ps.-Skylax 66),in  the  territorial  sense  (Thuc. 4.110.2)  and  in  the  political  sense  (Thuc. 4.110.1,  5.18.8  (Peace of  Nikias);  Isoc. 15.107\u00ad8;Xen.Hell.5.3.18);  cf.  politeuein  used of  the  Toronaians  in  Thuc. 4.114.1.  The  poet  Archestratos (C 4m)  described  Torone  as  an  asty  (fr. 24.1\u00ad2,  Olson  and Sens).  The  collective  city-ethnic  is  used  internally  on  coins (infra)  and  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3 266.ii.28).The  individual  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in a  citizenship  decree  from  Samos  (SEG 38  845  (C 4l))  on  a gravestone  from  Attika  (IG ii\u00b2  10454  (C 4))  and  in  Hdt. 8.127. Hdt. 7.122  locates  Torone  before  Gale(psos)  (no. 571)  on Sithonia.  Perhaps  the  southernmost  part  of  the  peninsula was  Toronaian  territory;  Steph.  Byz.  s.v. \u00b5  calls Ampelos  akra  Toronaion.  Thuc. 4.113.2  mentions  a  phrouri- on  Lekythos  on  a  promontory  close  to the  city  itself.  About  3 km  south  of  Torone  was  the  Kophos  limen,  which  belonged to  Torone  (Meritt  ( 1923)  453\u00ad54). The  communis  opinio  is  that  Torone  was  a  C 8  colony  from Chalkis  (no. 365)  (e.g.  Boardman  ( 1980)  229,  pace  Harrison ( 1912)).  Nevertheless,  the  only  ancient  source  to  call  Torone a  colony  from  Chalkis  is  Diod. 12.68.6,  who  evidently  inter- preted  Thucydides' ( 4.110.1)  as meaning  \"Torone,  a  colony  from  Chalkis\".  But  the  phrase does  not  necessarily  mean  that  Torone  was  a  colony  from Chalkis.  Thucydides  may  refer  to Torone's membership  of the  Chalkidian  Federation,  although  it  is  unclear  whether the  meaning  of  \"Chalkidian\"  is  (a)  geographical/territorial (  \"situated  in  Chalkidike\"),  (b)  ethnic  (  \"of  the Chalkidian  tribe\"),  or  (c)  specifically of  Chalkis  (cf. Hammond  ( 1995)  315  n. 37;  Hornblower  ( 1997)).  In  any  case, Torone  cannot  have  been  a  Euboian  colony  founded  ab  novo in  C 8,  since  excavations  have  shown  that  the  site  of  Torone was  inhabited  several  centuries  prior  to  C 8.  Furthermore, the  excavations  do  not  support  the  assumption  that  Torone was  a  colony  from  Chalkis  (see  also  Papadopoulos  ( 1996)). According  to  Hdt. 7.122,Torone  supplied  troops  and  ships to  Xerxes  in  480.  It  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  trib- ute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.ii.15)  to  429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.29) a  total  of  fourteen  times,  paying  in  most  years  6  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 266.ii.28),  in  some  years  12  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  259.ii.15,  260.viii.10, 281.ii.17)  and  in  447/6  possibly  two  payments  adding  up  to 16  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  265.ii.71,101).In  423  an  oligarchic  faction  (Thuc. 4.110.1\u00ad2)  invited  Brasidas  to  attack  Torone,  which  was  held by  the  Athenians,  and  he  managed  to  seize  it  with  the  help  of traitors  inside  the  town  (Thuc. 4.110\u00ad13;Gehrke,  Stasis 197\u00ad98).  The  majority  of  the  Athenians  who  were  in  Torone and  those  of  the  Toronaians  who  had  not  joined  Brasidas fled t o Lekythos,  a  fortification on a promontory a short  distance  from  the  city  itself.  The  Athenians  defended  them- selves,  but  were  eventually  forced  to  leave  (Thuc. 4.114\u00ad16). In 422  Kleon  recaptured  Torone  (Thuc. 5.3.4),  whereupon he  exposed  it  to  an  andrapodismos  by  enslaving  the  women and  the  children;  the  men  were  taken  captive  and  sent  to Athens,  but  later  ransomed  by  Olynthos  (no. 588)  (Thuc. 5.3.4;  cf.  Xen.  Hell. 2.2.3  and  Isoc. 12.63). Torone  was  a  member  of  the  Chalkidian  Federation  at least  until  380  (Xen.  Hell. 5.3.18).  During  the  Olynthian  War (i.e.  in  380)  Torone,  then  a  member  of  the  Chalkidian Federation,  was  attacked  and  taken  by  the  Spartans  (Xen. Hell. 5.3.18).  In  364  Torone  was  taken  again,  this  time  by Timotheos  (Diod. 15.81.5;Isoc.  15.108;Polyaen.  3.10.15).  And finally,  in  349,  before  attacking  Olynthos,  Philip  captured Torone  by  treachery  (Diod. 15.81.5),  but  did  not  destroy  the city.  In  C 4l  Gyges  of  Torone  was  granted  citizenship  in Samos  (IG xii.646;  see  Hatzopoulos  ( 1988b)  47  n. 8). Thuc. 4.113.2  mentions  the  agora  of  Torone.  It appears from  Thuc. 4.110.1  that  there  was  a  Dioskoreion  c. 3  stades ( 540  m)  from  the  city.  Thuc. 4.116.2  mentions  a  temple  of Athena  in  Lekythos  (near  the  city).  Fragments  of  a  Doric temple  have  been  interpreted  as  the  remains  of  this  temple (Cambitoglou  and  Papadopoulos  ( 1988)  205;  Cambitoglou ( 1990)  191\u00ad92;  Cambitoglou  and  Papadopoulos  ( 1991)  159). Thucydides  has  several  references  to  the  walls  of  Torone (e.g. 4.110\u00ad11).Part  of  the  extant  wall  dates  from  the  Classical period,  and  part  of  it  from  the  Hellenistic  period  (Ergon ( 1978)  27  fig. 29).  The  remains  of  the  early  Hellenistic  fortifi- cations  are  extensive  (Cambitoglou  and  Papadopoulos ( 1988)  183). Excavations  have  shown  that  the  site  of  Torone  was inhabited  continuously  from  the  late  Neolithic  period  to  the thrace  from  axios  to  strymon  847 post-Byzantine  period  (Papadopoulos  ( 1996)  160).  Torone probably  had  two  harbours,  one  by  the  city  itself,  and  one  c. 3 km  to  the  south,  the  Kophos  limen  (Thuc. 5.2.2\u00ad3; Hornblower ( 1996)  425\u00ad26).  Thuc. 5.2.4  mentions  the proasteion  of  Torone,  and  it  is  clear  from  Thuc. 4.114.2  that there  were  houses  close  to  Lekythos.  Beneath  the  Classical city  an  early  Iron  Age  cemetery  has  been  found.  By  1984,  134 graves  had  been  excavated,  yielding  more  than  500  vessels. The  finds dated from c. 1125  to c. 850  (Cambitoglou  and Papadopoulos  ( 1988)  187).  A  house  excavated  in  1976  and 1978  seemed  not  to  be  of  the  pastas  type  known  from Olynthos,  but  resembled  \"the  lay-out  of  the  so-called Herdraumh\u00e4user prevalent  in  north-west  Greece\" (Cambitoglou  and  Papadopoulos  ( 1988)  186).  Excavations on  the  promontory  of  Lekythos  show  that  Torone  was  a  rel- atively  important  settlement  in  the  early  Iron  Age (Cambitoglou  ( 1990)  188).  Henry  ( 1993)  combines Thucydides'  description  with  the  archaeological  evidence. Only  one  month  name  is  known  from  Torone:  viz. Artemision,  found  in  a  deed  of  sale  (Karamanoli-Siganidou ( 1966);  cf.  SEG 24  574.2  (C 4)). Torone  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Euboic  standard  from C 6lto  c. 480  and  on  the  Phoenician  standard  from  c. 480  to c. 420.  Denominations:  tetradrachms,  tetrobols,  obols  and hemiobols.  ( 1)C6l\u00ad480:  types:  obv.  amphora,  or  oinochoe; legend: or ;  rev.  incuse  square.

Macedonia 336\u00ad38).  Bronze  coins  were  struck  in  C 4 (Hardwick  ( 1998)). 621.  Tripoiai Unlocated.  Type:  [A]:?  The  toponym  is (IG i\u00b3  76  l. 46  Tod 68  (c. 422))  or  (IG i\u00b3 285.iii.8).  Tripoiai  is  listed  under  the  heading     in a  treaty  of  c. 422  (IG i\u00b3  76.44,  46). Tripoiai  was  a  Bottiaian  polis  which  was  located  in  the vicinity  of  Kalindoia,  i.e.  probably  in  the  northern  part  of Bottike  (Flensted-Jensen  ( 1995)  116\u00ad17).  The  name  of  the territory  was and  it  was  given  to  the Makedonians  by Alexander  (SEG 36  626.6\u00ad7  ( 323)). Tripoiai  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League,  but  it  is recorded  only  once  in  the  tribute  lists  in  the  Thracian  dis- trict:  viz.in 421/0  (IG i\u00b3  285.iii.8),  paying  800  dr.  About  the same  time  the  Bottiaians  had  probably  formed  a  confedera- cy  (Flensted-Jensen  ( 1995)  126\u00ad28),  of  which  Tripoiai  was  a member  (IG i\u00b3  76.47). 622.  Zereia  (Zeranios) Map  51.  Unlocated.  Size  of  territo- ry:  ?  Type:  C:?  The  toponym  is  (IG i\u00b3  77.v.18).  It  has been  suggested  (Zahrnt  ( 1971)  186  with  refs.)  that  the  inhab- itants  of  Zereia  were  the  mentioned  by Theopomp.  fr. 214.  Their  territory  is  called  by Ephor.  fr. 88.  Zereia  may  have  been  a  member  of  the  Delian League:  it  was  assessed  for  tribute  in  422/1  (IG i\u00b3  77.v.18)  500 dr.,  but  is  unattested  in  the  tribute  lists. 4.  Unlocated  Poleis 623.  Aison  (Aisonios) Unlocated.  Not  in  Barr.  Type  [A]:? The  toponym  is  ( [  ],IG  i\u00b3  262.iv.27)  or   (h ,  IG i\u00b3  271.ii.48).  The  city-ethnic  is   ( ~,  IG i\u00b3  268.iii.16)  or  (h ~[],  IG i\u00b3 279.ii.66)  or  (h ,  IG i\u00b3  277.v.28). Aison  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Thracian  district  (IG i\u00b3  271.ii.48)  and  is  recorded  from 454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.ii.19)  to  429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.54)  a  total  of  sev- enteen  times,  twice  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1,500  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  268.iii.16),  reduced  to  1,000  dr.  in  432/1  (IG i\u00b3 280.ii.62)  or  perhaps  in  433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.66,  amount completely  restored).  It  is  recorded  twice  by  toponym,  and otherwise  by  ethnic  (supra).  In the  tribute  list  for  the  year 429/8  the  Aisonioi  are  recorded  under  the  heading  h  ~         (IG i\u00b3 282.ii.51\u00ad52,  54)  where  polis  is  used  in  the  political  sense. As  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  are  the  only  sources  we  have for  Aison,  all  we  know  about  its  location  is  that  it  was  locat- ed  somewhere  in  the  Thracian  district.  A  river  by  the  name of situated  in  southern  Makedonia  is  mentioned  by Plutarch at  Aem. 16.9.  Referring  to this  source,  RE  i\u00adii  suppl. 40  and  ATL  i. 467  followed  by  Zahrnt  ( 1971)  146  suggest  a location  near  the  modern  river  Pelikas  (  ancient  Aison). However,  Edson  ( 1947)  88  argues  that,  apart  from  Methone (no. 541),it  is  highly  unlikely  that  any  other  Makedonian  city was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  He  prefers  to identify Aison  with  Haisa  (no. 573),  a  suggestion  rejected  by  Zahrnt ( 1971).As  the  evidence  stands,  Aison's  precise  location  with- in  the  Thracian  district  remains  unknown. 624.

An  Athenian  decree  of  c. 445  (ML 49),  439/8  (Woodhead ( 1952)  61),or  perhaps  426/5  (Mattingly  ( 1966)  185)  lays  down the  rules  for  the  founding  of  a  new  colony  (apoikia),  Brea,  in 848 flensted-jensen Thrace.  The  name  of  the  oecist  was  Demokleides.  The  attes- tation  of  the  city-ethnic  in  a  fragment  of  Theopompos  (fr. 145)  is  the  only  evidence  that  the  decree  was  carried  into effect  (Hansen  ( 2001)  320\u00ad21). Some  scholars  believe  that  Brea  was  situated  in  the Chalkidic  peninsula  (Woodhead  ( 1952)  62;  Asheri  ( 1969)), others  that  it  was  in  Bisaltia  (Meritt  ( 1967)  48;  Gomme ( 1945)  373).  Following  Pazaras  and  Tsanana  ( 1990),  Barr. identifies B rea  or  Beroia  with  modern  Veria,  which  has, however,  only  random  C 4  finds. 625.

So  all we  know  is  that  Kossaia  was  a  settlement  somewhere  in  Thrace which  in  425/4  was  assessed  for  tribute  by  the  Athenians.  The suggestion  to  locate  Kossaia  in  Chalkidike  (Bradeen  ( 1952) 374\u00ad75)  was  rightly  rejected  by  Zahrnt  ( 1971)  195. 626.  Okolon  Unlocated,  not  in  Barr.  Type:  C:?

Phaselis  is  called  a  polis  in  the urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skylax  and  in  the  political  sense  by Herodotos  ( 2.178.2\u00ad3).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic is  attested  internally  on  coins  of  C 5f  and  C 4  (infra)  and  in  a treaty  with  Mausolos  of  Karia  (TAM ii  1183.3,  4,  10),  and externally  in  an  Athenian  decree  regulating  relations  with Phaselis  (IG i\u00b3  10.5)  and  in  literary  sources  (Dem. 35.1).  The individual  use  is  attested  externally  both  in  inscriptions  (IG i\u00b3  1360;  CID ii  4.i.72\u00ad73;  IG xii632.4  ( 306\u00ad301))  and  in  liter- ary  sources  (Theodectas  (TrGF 72  T 2);  Dem. 35.10). Ps.-Skylax  and  Strabo  place  Phaselis  in  Lykia; Aristodemos  and  Suda  ( 121) place it in Pamphylia;  it  is  in Solyma  according  to  the  Lindos  Temple  Chronicle  ((FGrHist 532)  fr.  c. 24).  That  Phaselis  possessed  a  territory  is  shown  by the  report  of  Kimon  ravaging  the  c.469(Plut.Cim.12); it  is  also  mentioned  by  Arrian  (Anab. 1.24.6  (r 334/3)). Lyrnateia  probably  bordered  on  Phaselis  ((Arist.)  973a8).  In the  Peace  of  Kallias  in  449  Phaselis  is  the  boundary  west  of which  Persian  fleets w ere  not  allowed  to  sail  (Diod. 12.4.5). Phaselis  was  supposedly  colonized  from  Lindos  on Rhodes  in  691/0  (Euseb. 93b.2,  Helm;  Blumenthal  ( 1963)), and  at  Plut.  Cim. 12.3  the  people  of  Phaselis  are  recorded  as Hellenes.  The  oikistes  was  supposedly  Lakios  (Aristainetos (FGrHist 771)  fr. 1;  Ath. 7.297E\u00ad298A),  a  native  of  either Lindos  or  Argos  (Philostephanos  FHG iii  29),  but  he  is  possibly  mythical;  for  the  earliest  attested  version  of  the foundation  myth,  from  C 5/4,see  Herophytos  fr. 1.Phaselis  is listed  as  one  of  the  four  Dorian  poleis  involved  in  the  foun- dation  of  Naukratis  (Hdt. 2.178.2). Phaselis  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Karian  district  (IG i\u00b3  269.iv.9),later  incorporated  into the  Ionian  district  (IG i\u00b3  279.i.46).  It  was  forced  to  join  the League  c. 469  (Plut.  Cim. 12.3\u00ad4)  and  is  registered  in  the  trib- ute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.24)  to  415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.i.17) a  total  of  fifteen times,  three  times  completely  restored,  pay- ing  a  phoros  of 6  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.24),  reduced  to  3  tal.  in 450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.ii.35),but  changed  again  before  433/2  (IG i\u00b3 272.i.90),  either  back  to 6  tal.  or  further  reduced  to  2  tal.  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.129).  In  411 Phaselis  had  fallen  into  Persian  hands  and  was  occupied  by  a Spartan  force  (Thuc. 8.99).  Phaselis  also  had  a  long- standing  friendship  with  Chios  (Plut.  Cim. 12).  Phaselis made  a  treaty  with  Mausolos  in  the  350s  (TAM ii  1183.3,  4, 10),  apparently  on  equal  terms.  Proxenia  and  citizenship were  received  from  Samos  in  306\u00ad301  by  Timophanes  son  of Archepolis  (IG xii632).  Mutual  legal  arrangements ( \u00b5  ) existed in C5  with  Athens  (IG i\u00b3  10); disputes  between  Athenians  and  Phaseliots  were  to  be  tried at  Athens.  For  the  close  commercial  relations  in  C 4  between Phaselis  and  Athens,  see  Dem. 35.1  et  passim. Phaselis  had  a  cult  of  Athena  Polias  (TAM ii  1184,not  later than  C 5).There  was  also  an  annual  sacrifice t o  Kylabras,  dat- ing  to  the  colony's  foundation  (Ath. 7.297E\u00ad298A,  citing Herophytos  (FGrHist 448)  fr. 1  and  Philostephanos  (FHG iii 29)).  Phaselis  was  one  of  the  cities  responsible  for  building 1140 keen  and  hansen the  Hellenion  at  Naukratis  in  C 6  (Hdt. 2.178.2\u00ad3),  and  made dedications  to  Athena  on  Lindos  (Burn  ( 1960)  48  n. 19). The  city  was  fortified c. 469  (Plut.  Cim. 12.3\u00ad4)  and  a  few remains  of  the  C 5  fortifications are still e xtant.  As  rebuilt c. 300,  they  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 20  ha  (Sch\u00e4fer  ( 1981)  49\u00ad86; for  the  dates,  see  54,  58,  84,  164\u00ad66).A  fortified settlement on a  hill  north  of  the  city  dates  to  the  Hellenistic  period (Schl\u00e4ger  and  Schafer  ( 1971);  Sch\u00e4fer  ( 1981)  125\u00ad35).  An agora  is  mentioned  in  the  context  of 334/3  by Plutarch (Alex. 18.4).  Ps.-Skylax  notes  Phaselis'  limen  (   \u00b5), which  is  archaeologically  visible.  The  were  in  fact  two  har- bours,  one  north  and  one  south  of  the  acropolis.

Xanthos  (Xanthios) Map  65.  Lat. 36.20,  long: 29.20. Size of  territory:  ? Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is  , (Hdt. 1.176.3,  denoting  the  city;  Hecat.  fr. 255,  denoting  the river).  The  city-ethnic  is  (Hdt. 1.176.2\u00ad3;  SEG 36 1216.i.1,  8\u00ad9  ( 340\u00ad34)).  Steph.  Byz. 123.12\u00ad14  records  an  alter- native  toponym, ,  derived  from  Lykian  Ar\u00f1na (Melchert  ( 1993)  6). Xanthos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  on  Erbbina's statue  base  (SEG 39  1414.24  (C 4e))  and  in  a  tax  exemption decree  from  Xanthos  issued  by  Pixodaros,  polis  in  the  urban sense  refers  to  the  inhabitants  of  Xanthos,  as  well  as  those  of Tlos,  Pinara  and  Kadyanda  (SEG 36  1216.4  ( 340\u00ad334)). Finally  Xanthos  is  called  polis  by  Ps.-Skylax 100  (as  restored by  M\u00fcller).  Polis  in  the  political  sense  is  attested  on  a  trilin- gual  cult  inscription  from  the  Leto\u00f6n  (Neumann  ( 1979)  N 320.b.18  SEG 27  342  ( 337)),  but  the  Greek  text  is  a  transla- tion  of  the  Lykian  (Blomqvist  ( 1982);  Briant  ( 1998)  307).The Lykian  word rendered  by polis  is  teteri,  for  which  see  Kolb and  Tietz  ( 2001)  395.  Xanthos  is  called  an  by Herodotos  ( 1.176.1)  and  on  Erbbina's  statue  base  (SEG 39 1414.5\u00ad6).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested internally  on  the  tax  exemption  edict  of  Pixodaros  (SEG 36 1216.i.1\u00ad2,  8\u00ad9)  and  the  trilingual  cult  inscription  (SEG 27 942.5\u00ad6),  and  externally  by  Herodotos  ( 1.176.2\u00ad3).  The  indi- vidual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  a  C 3e bilingual  epitaph  from  Kition  (SEG 40  1355)  and  in  literary sources  (Suda 2963  (rC 4)). Decrees  of  Xanthos  set  up  at  the  Leto\u00f6n  (e.g.  Neumann ( 1979)  N  320)  indicate  that  the  sanctuary  was  part  of  the  ter- ritory  of  Xanthos  (Schweyer  ( 1996)  28\u00ad29).  Xanthos  proba- bly  had  upland  estates,  which  is  where  those  who  escaped the  destruction  of  the  city  in  c. 540  (Hdt. 1.176.3)  were  (Bean ( 1978)  50).  Xanthos  is  placed  in  Lykia  by  Hekataios, Herodotos  ( 1.176.3)  and  Ps.-Skylax  ( 100). The  city  was  destroyed,  and  the  mass  of  the  population killed,  in  an  act  of  mass  suicide  c. 540  (Hdt. 1.176.1\u00ad2;App.  B Civ. 4.10.80;Plut.  Brut. 31.7)  and  subsequently  resettled  by (Hdt. 1.176.3). Xanthos  may  have  been  a  member  of  the  Delian  League,  if a  reference  to  Xanthos  is  concealed  in  the  entry  (IG i\u00b3  261.i.30,  262.v.33)  and    [] (IG  i\u00b3 266.iii.34;  see  Bean  ( 1978)  25;  Keen  ( 1998)  40).  In  this  case,  it was  included  in  the   ,and the syntely paid 10 tal.  of  tribute  in  446/5. Menekrates  of  Xanthos  ((FGrHist 769)  fr. 1  Steph.  Byz. 129.3)  mentions  Xanthian  presbutai  in  a  mythological  con- text;  note  also  that  Jacoby  suggests  a  possible  reading  here  of instead  of . A  joint  decree  of  Xanthians  and  perioikoi  stipulates  the foundation  of  a  cult  for  Basileus  Kaunios  (SEG 27  942.5\u00ad6:      ,  where  is  a  translation  of  epew\u00afetlmm\u00afei  in  the  Lykian  original).  The opposition  has  been  interpreted  as  a  purely  geographical (Keen  ( 1998)  55\u00ad56)  or  an  institutionalised  (W\u00f6rrle  ( 1978) 238)  distinction  between  the  Xanthians  settled  in  the  city and  those  in  the  hinterland.  In  the  latter  case  the  two  strata of  population  were probably  hierarchically  organised  rather than  equal;  analogy  with  other  perioikic  populations  sug- gests  that  they  were  usually  dependent  communities (Domingo  Gygax  ( 2001)  19\u00ad40).  It  should  be  added,  how- ever,  that  joint  decisions  made  by polis  and  perioikoi  are known from  Lykia  only,  and  probably  reflect L ykian  rather than  Greek  institutions.  The  trilingual  inscription  attests  an epimeletes  (SEG 27  942.4\u00ad5),probably  appointed  by  the  local satrap  (Bryce  ( 1986)  133),  and  a  hiereus  of  Basileus  Kaunios and  Arkesimas,  appointed  by  the  people  of  Xanthos  (SEG 27 942.8).  Lykian-language  inscriptions  (e.g.  TAM i36 (C 5\u00adC4))  mention  officials called mi\u00f1ti  (on  which  see  Bryce ( 1986)  121\u00ad23). SEG 42  1245.3  (c. 400)  identifies an agora,  in  which  there  was a  temenos  of  the  Lykian  Twelve  Gods  (Tritsch  ( 1942)  41\u00ad42; Picard  ( 1951)  137\u00ad38;  Martin  ( 1951)  169\u00ad74).  Menekrates  fr. 2.3 records  a  hieron  of  Apollo.  On  the  Lykian  acropolis  are  a  C 6 sanctuary  (Metzger  et al.( 1963)  29\u00ad36)  and  the  foundations  of a  building  with  three  cellas  ( 12  10.3  m),  a  C 5  sanctuary  of  a lykia  1141 divinity,  perhaps  Artemis  (Metzger  et al.( 1963)  40\u00ad42;identi- fied from a H ellenistic  inscription).  Appian  (B  Civ. 4.10.78\u00ad9) records  a  ,  probably  to  be  identified w ith  a  C 5 building  on  the  acropolis  (Keen  ( 1992)  55\u00ad56,  ( 1996)).  Three temples  are  known  from  the  Leto\u00f6n,  dated  to  the  Classical period  by  Metzger  et al.( 1992)  but  probably  Hellenistic  (Erik Hansen,  pers.  comm.).  For  cults  of  Basileus  Kaunios  and Arkesimas,  see  Metzger  et al.( 1979)). There  is  a  dynastic  residence  on  the  acropolis  (Metzger  et al.( 1963)  16\u00ad23;  Bean  ( 1978)  55).The  Classical  acropolis,  men- tioned  by  Herodotos  ( 1.176.1),  was  the  lower  of  two  hills  on the  site,  on  which  a  c. 475\u00ad50  polygonal  wall  survives  (Metzger et al.( 1963)  16\u00ad23;  Bean  ( 1978)  54).  Further  walls  encompass the  so-called  Hellenistic  acropolis;  Herodotos  ( 1.176)  implies that  the  city  was  walled  and  capable  of  withstanding  siege. The  city  had  walls  in  the  Hellenistic  period  (Plut.  Brut. 30.8, 31.2,  4),  of  which  much  of  the  circuit  and  the  south  gate  sur- vive  (Metzger  et al.( 1963)  9\u00ad10  for  the  circuit).  There  is  an \"early\"  polygonal  wall  at  the  Leto\u00f6n  (Bean  ( 1978)  63).  (On walls,  see  also  Ritter  ( 1859)  1020\u00ad21;  Benndorf  and  Niemann ( 1884)  127,  138;  Robert  and  Robert  ( 1983)  124ff  n. 4.) Xanthos  minted  silver  coins  on  the  light  Lykian  standard c. 450\u00ad370.  There  is  a  variety  of  types  including  obv.  head  of Athena  wearing  crested  helmet  (the  characteristic  obv. motive  from  c. 425  in  common  with  west  Lykian  cities);  rev. head  of  Athena,  or  head  of  Apollo  or  eagle.  All  carry  Lykian legends  until  c. 370/60  when  the  autonomous  Lykian  coinage ended  (Ar\u00f1naha/Ar\u00f1nahe  or  abbreviation);  most  also  carry a  dynast's  name  (M\u00f8rkholm  and  Neumann  ( 1978)  M 205a\u00adb,  221\u00ad223c,  224a\u00adb,  240a\u00add).  In  C 5  Xanthian  dynasts struck  coins  too  on  the  heavy  east  Lykian  standard  and  on the  so-called  middle  standard  (M\u00f8rkholm  and  Zahle  ( 1972), ( 1976);  M\u00f8rkholm  and  Neumann  ( 1978);  Vismara ( 1989\u00ad96);  Kolb  and  Tietz  ( 2001);  SNG  Cop.  suppl. 445, 447\u00ad48,  455,  460,  496A). It  is  a  much  debated  problem  to  what  extent  Xanthos was  a  Hellenic  community  before  the  Hellenistic  period. The  barbarian  ethnicity  of  Xanthos  is  suggested  by Herodotos'  considering  it  Lykian  ( 1.176.3),  since  he  consid- ers  the  Lykians  barbaroi  (supra).  All  coins  of  the  Classical period  carry  Lykian  legends  (supra).  Also,  most  inscrip- tions  of  the  Classical  period  are  in  Lykian  (TAM i36\u00ad51 (C 5\u00adC4))  rather  than  Greek  (cf.  Bryce  ( 1986)  211).  The habit  of  striking  coins,  as  well  as  Greek  pottery  found  in Xanthos  (Metzger  et  al.( 1972))  are  evidence  of  Greek  con- tacts  and  Greek  influence,  but  not  of  Greek  settlers  (Keen ( 1998)  61\u00ad70).  In  C 4,  however,  the  picture  changes.  The  ear- liest  bilingual  inscription  is  a  Greek  epigram  on  the \"inscribed  pillar\"  of  C 5l\u00adC4e(TAM  i44C  ML 93;  cf.  SEG 45  1827).  The  C 4e  inscription  from  Xanthos  honouring  the Lycian  dynast  Arbinas  is  in  Greek  without  a  parallel  text  in Lykian  (SEG 39  1414  CEG 2  888).  The  Irano-centric  inter- pretation  of  the  text  by  Herrenschmidt  ( 1985)  has  been countered  by  Lev\u00eaque  and  Pleket  (SEG 36  1215),  emphasis- ing  Greek  values.  With  the  Hekatomnid  domination  of Lykia,  Greek  seems  to  have  become  an  official  language alongside  Lykian  (Le  Roy  ( 1987)),  as  is  attested  in  Xanthos by  Pixodaros'  trilingual  edict  concerning  exemption  from taxes  (SEG 36  1216).  The  Hekatomnid  Hellenisation  of Karia  (Hornblower  ( 1982)  332\u00ad51)  was  presumably  trans- ferred  to  Lykia  too,  especially  by  Pixodaros.  He  was  satrap of  Lykia  (SEG 27  942.1\u00ad2)from  340  to 334  (Diod. 16.74.2). Artemelis,  his  epimeletes  in  Xanthos,  was  a  Karian,  but Hieron  and  Apollodotos,  his  two  archontes  of  Lykia,  may have  been  Greeks  (SEG 27  942.3\u00ad5).  Furthermore,  a  local Greek  historian,  Menekrates  of  Xanthos,  is  commonly dated  to  C 4  (FGrHist 769);  he  wrote  a  work  entitled Lykiaka  in  two  books  in  which  he  reports,  or  perhaps invents,  Homeric  foundation  myths  for  the  Lykian  cities and  suggests  that  Xanthos  colonized  Pinara  and  two  other unnamed  cities.  Thus,  in  C 4s  there  were  sufficient  elements of  Hellenisation  in  Xanthos  to  justify  the  inclusion  of  that city  in  the  Inventory  as  an  example  of  a  mixed  community (Keen  ( 1998)  66\u00ad69). 1142 keen  and  hansen"}, "Makedonia": {"Ichnai": "Identifier: 539. , (Ichnaios) Map  50.

The  probable  site  of  the  urban  centre has  been  totally  destroyed  by  intense  agricultural  activity (ArchDelt 49  ( 1994)  Chron. 455). Two  fragments  of  an  inscription  of  unknown  date  might belong  to  a  treaty  between  Ichnai  and  Dikaia  (Papazoglou ( 1988)  155\u00ad56).  A  citizen  of  Ichnai  was  awarded  proxenia  by Delphi  (F.Delphes iii.3207.3  (C 3m));  another  Ichnaian  was appointed  theorodokos  for  theoroi  arriving  from  the  same city  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  17  iii.63  (c. 220)). Judging  by  the  onomastic  evidence,  Ichnai  must  have been  originally  a  Paionian  settlement  which  already  in Archaic  times  received  an  influx of  Southern  Greek colonists.  After  the  Makedonian  conquest,  settlers  from  the Old  Kingdom  were  added  to  its  population  (cf.  Hatzopoulos ( 1996b)  i. 107  n. 1).

Geog. 3.12.36  (cf. 17),  but  its  mention  alongside  Dion and  Amphipolis  in  Alexander's  `\u00b5\u00b5  (infra) leaves  no  doubt  that  Kyrrhos  too  was  a  polis  already  in  C 4.

For  the individual  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic,  see  SEG 43  435 (early  third  century  ad). The  territory of  Kyrrhos  bordered  on  the  territories  of Edessa  to  the  west,  Skydra  to  the  south-west,  Pella  to  the south-east,  Tyrissa  to  the  east,  and  Europos  to  the  north- east.  An  unpublished  C 3  decree  (cf.  Vavritsas  ( 1977))  reveals that  Genderrhos  was  a  kome  of  Kyrrhos.  The  name  of  anoth- er  meros  (kome?)  of  the  city,  Mandarai,  is  preserved  in  Steph. Byz. 430.17. The  earliest  public  enactment  of  Kyrrhos  is  an  unpub- lished  C 3  decree  concerning  public  works  in  the  vicinity  and in  the  agora  of  the  city  (Vavritsas  ( 1977)). Kyrrhos  was  renowned  for  its  sanctuary  of  Athena Kyrrhestis,  which  was  located  on  the  hill  of  Palaiokastron (Vavritsas  ( 1977)).  It  would  be  tempting  to  interpret  the mass  of  semi-worked  limestone  blocks  in  a  nearby C 4s quarry  (Bakalakis  ( 1970))  as  preliminary  work  for  the   of  Athena  which  Alexander  was  planning  to built  in  Kyrrhos  (Diod. 18.4.5);  two  C 4l/C3e  poros  capitals-- probably  of  a  temple--may attest a later attempt t o  imple- ment  Alexander's  plan  (Haddad  ( 1993);  Adam-Veleni  ( 1998) 6).  The  sanctuary  of  Artemis  Agrotera  is  known  from  dedications  of  the  Roman  period  (Panayotou  and Chrysostomou  ( 1993)  379\u00ad80).  The  agora  of  the  city  is  men- tioned  several  times  in  the  C 3  unpublished  decree  (Vavritsas ( 1977)  8;  Hatzopoulos  ( 1996b)  i. 438\u00ad39). The  patron  deity  of  Kyrrhos  was  Athena,  for  whom Alexander  was  planning  to  build  a  magnificent t emple  at  the time  of  his  death  (Diod. 18.4.5).  The  cult  of  Athena Kyrrhestis,  which  is  also  attested  epigraphically  (SEG 27  258 (Roman)),  was  transferred  to  the  homonymous  city  in Syria.  Other  communal  cults  were  those  of  Artemis Agrotera  (attested  by  Roman  evidence:  SEG 30  553\u00ad54,  35 750,  43  404\u00ad5)  and  of  Zeus  Hypsistos  (P.

Leibethra  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  in  Paus. 9.30.9,  referring  to  the  mythical  period.  The  term  patris  is used  in  Orph.  Argonaut. 1374.  Alternative  site-classifications are  ethnos  (Arist.  fr. 552),  chorion  or  oros  (Strabo  10.3.17), topos  (Hsch.,  s.v. ) and   (Lyc.  Alex. 275). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on an  inscribed  weight  of  one  mina  (SEG 27  283  (undated))  and externally  in  Arist.  fr. 563  and  in  a  C 3e  decree  from  Gonnoi (Gonnoi 2.6). Originally  populated  by  Thracian  Pieres,  Leibethra  and this  part  of  Pieria  were conquered  by the  Makedonians  c.C 7 (Strabo  10.3.17;  cf.  Hammond  ( 1972)  417). According  to  the  legend  mentioned  by  Pausanias  ( 9.30.11), the  city  was  destroyed  by  the  river  Sys.  The  topography  of  the site  and  the  remains  of  the  walls  make  such  a  \"destruction\"  by the  four  torrents  in  the  area  quite  possible  (Kotzias  ( 1948\u00ad49) 33\u00ad34),although  the  continued  existence  of  the  city  is  secured by  Classical  (Pritchett  ( 1991)  127)  and  Hellenistic  (Kotzias ( 1948\u00ad49)  34)  remains,  by  the  mention  of  the  city  in  the  C 3 inscription  from  Gonnoi  (Gonnoi 2.6)  and  by  the  C 3l  Delphic list  of  theorodokoi  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  17  iii.53). The  territory  of  Leibethra  probably  extended  from  the mountainous  area  of  Lower  Olympos  to  the  valley  of  Sys (Helly  ( 1973)  35\u00ad36;  Gonnoi 5).The  city  bordered  on  Gonnoi to  the  south-west,  presumably  on  Herakleion  to the  south, and  Dion  to  the  north. The  cults  of  Orpheus,  the  Nymphs,  the  Muses  and Dionysos  are  attested  in  literary  sources  (Kotzias  ( 1948\u00ad49) 26\u00ad28).  The  cult  of  the  latter  deity  has  now  found  a  possible archaeological  confirmation ( SEG 27  283). The  legend  of  the  city's  destruction  mentions  the  exist- ence  of  walls  (Paus. 9.30.11).  Kotzias  (( 1948\u00ad49)  33\u00ad34),  who makedonia  803 excavated  the  site,  discovered  part  of  a  circuit  of 1.5  m-wide walls.  According  to  Pritchett  (( 1991)  127),  the  circuit  was  no more  than  500  m  long.  Recent  work  has  confirmed that the acropolis  ( 1.5  ha)  was  walled  and  that  the  site  was  not  aban- doned  until  C 1  (ArchDelt 50  ( 1995)  Chron. 497\u00ad98). 541.

The  territory  of  Allante  bordered  on  that  of  Pella  to  the north-west,  Ichnai  to  the  north  and  Herakleia  to  the  east, across  the  Axios;  to  the  south  it  reached  the  ancient  shore- line.  Allante  was  probably  a  C 5e  Makedonian  foundation designed  to  cut  off  the  then  Paionian  city  of  Ichnai  from  the sea  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1996b)  i. 111). Allantaian  theorodokoi  were  appointed  to  host  theoroi from  Nemea  (SEG 36  331.B.21  ( 331/30\u00ad313)).  If  the  ethnic  is correctly  restored  in  IG iv  617.17,  Allante  is  recorded  on  the Argive  list  of  contributors  of  C 4l,  which  may  be  connected with  the  dispatching  of  theoroi  (cf.

The  territory of  Aloros  bordered  on  that  of  Aigeai  to the west  and  Methone  to  the  south,  while  to  the  north  it  must have  been  delimited  by  the  marshes  of  Lake  Loudiake. Traces  of  a  circuit  wall  of  poros  blocks  c. 1  km  long  have been  spotted  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1987b)  38).  Excavations  begun in 1988  (Apostolou  ( 1998))  have  revealed  a  C 4  two-room building,  probably  a  temple,  with  an  adjoining  Archaic structure,  probably  an  altar  (Apostolou  ( 1991)). 533.Beroia  (Beroiaios) Maps  49\u00ad50.

Beroia  is  first attested as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  a  C 4l  dedication  (I.Beroia 29  Hatzopoulos  ( 1996b)  no. 73)  and  is  called  a  polis  in  the urban  sense  in  Ps.-Skymnos  626  (C 2).  The  term  chorion  is used  by Thuc. 1.61.4,  and  the  term  polisma  by App.  Syr. 57. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in an  honorific inscription ( I.Beroia 59  (C 1)).  The  individual use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  a  consecration from  the  sanctuary  of  Leukopetra  (I.Leukopetra 31.5  ( ad 192/3))  and  externally  in  an  unpublished  dedication  from makedonia  799 the  Perrhaibian  Tripolis  (cf.  Hatzopoulos  ( 1996b)  i. 156,n.  15 (C 4s))  and  in  a  C 3f  Epidaurian  list  of  theorodokoi  (IG iv\u00b2.1 96.22). The  territory of  Beroia  bordered  on  that  of  Mieza  to the north,  Pella  to  the  north-east,  Aigeai  to  the  south-east  and on  the  regions  of  Eordaia  to  the  north-west  and  Elemia  to the  south-west.  Among  the  secondary  settlements  of  the original  territory of  Beroia,  we know  the  names  of  Kyneoi, Auranton,  Kannonea  and  Droga  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1990)). The  constitution  of  Beroia,  like  the  constitution  of  all  the cities  of  Makedonia,  had  a  pronounced  aristocratic  char- acter.  Not  only  slaves,  but  also  freedmen,  their  sons,  male prostitutes  and  craftsmen  were excluded  from  civic  life (Gauthier  and  Hatzopoulos  ( 1993)  78\u00ad87),  and  full  enfran- chisement  probably  was  subject  to  a  minimum  census  in landed  property (Hatzopoulos  ( 1996b)  i. 209  n. 1).  The  chief executive  official was the e pistates  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1996b)  ii. no. 73),who--at least later--was  assisted  by  a  board  of  mag- istrates  who  may  have  been  called  tagoi  (Hatzopoulos ( 1996b)  i. 156). The  patron  deity  of  Beroia  was  Herakles  Kynagidas,  who was  revered  as  the  ancestor  of  the  royal  family--not only of the  Temenids,  but  also  later  of  the  Antigonids  (Edson  ( 1934) 226\u00ad32;  Allamani-Souri  ( 1993b);  Hatzopoulos  ( 1994a) 102\u00ad11).  The  cult  of  Asklepios  was  also  important  (Voutiras ( 1993)  257),  and  his  priest  was  eponymous,  as  in  all Makedonian  cities  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1996b)  i. 152\u00ad54).  His  cult was,  at  least  later,  associated  with  those  of  Apollo  and Hygieia  (I.Beroia 16  (C 3s)).  The  cult  of  Dionysos  was  an ancient  one  (cf.  the  epistylion  of  the  theatre  bearing  a  dedi- cation  to  the  god,  I.Beroia 21  (C 4l));  with  the  epithets  Agrios, Erikryptos,  Pseudanor  it  is  attested  only  in  Imperial  times, but,  given  its  archaic  character,  it  certainly  had  much  earlier origins  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1994a)  65\u00ad85).  From  the  Hellenistic period  are  attested  cults  of  Athena  (I.Beroia 17),  Ennodia (I.Beroia 23),  Hermes  (I.Beroia 24),  Pan  (I.Beroia 37)  and Atargatis  (I.Beroia 19).  Beroia  is  recorded  on  the  Argive  list of  contributors  (IG iv  617.17  (C 4l)),  which  may  be  connect- ed  with  the  dispatching  of  theoroi  (cf.  Perlman  ( 2000)  74). The  failure  of  the  Athenians  to  capture  Beroia  in  432 (Thuc. 1.61.4)  probably  implies  that  at  least  part  of  the  city, such  as  the  acropolis  situated  in  the  western  extremity,  was already  fortified.  Traces  of  a  C 4l  circuit  wall  made  of  local poros  have been  discovered  in  different  parts  of  the  modern town  (Petkos  ( 1997)  272).  There  were  at  least  three  gates,  one of  which  bore  the  name  (I.Beroia 41;  cf.  Brocas- Deflassieux ( 1999)  37\u00ad41).  The  continuous  habitation  of  the site  from  the  Iron  Age  to  the  present  (cf.  Allamani-Souri ( 1993a);  Allamani-Souri  and  Apostolou  ( 1992)  97)  have left very  few  traces  of  the  ancient  town  plan.  It  is  presumed  that the  ancient  agora  and  main  road  axes  correspond  to  the modern  civic  centre  and  road  system  (Brocas-Deflassieux ( 1999)  99\u00ad101).  The  stadion  has  been  located  in  the  eastern outskirts  of  the  city.  Epigraphic  finds have permitted the location  of  the  gymnasion--first  attested  in  the  Hellenistic period--in the same area south of  the  stadion  (Brocas- Deflassieux ( 1999)  87\u00ad90).  A  late  Classical  or  early Hellenistic  epistylion  with  a  dedication  to  Dionysos (I.Beroia 21)  provides  evidence  for  the  functioning  of  the theatre  in  that  period. 534.

The  territory  of  Herakleion  bordered  on  that  of  Gonnoi to  the  south-west  (see  the  dossier  in  Gonnoi 93\u00ad107), Leibethra  on  the  north  and  possibly  Homolion,  beyond  the Peneios,  before  the  foundation  of  Phila  on  the  mouth  of  that river  in  Hellenistic  times. Herakleion  became  a  member  of  the  Delian  League  some time  between  430/29  and 425/4  or,  at  least,  the  Athenians claimed  its  membership  and  had  it  assessed  for  a  tribute  of 1,000  drachmas  (IG i\u00b3  71.iv.108,  completely  restored; 77.v.21). Herakleion  appears  as  a  walled  city  in  169  (Polyb. 28.11.1; Livy  44.9.1\u00ad9),but  its  fortifications most probably date from C 5,  since  the  city  could  successfully  challenge  the  authority of  Perdikkas  II  and  remain  a  member  of  the  Delian  League for  years.  Presumably,  the  walls  covered  the  entire  hill,  since Heuzey ( 1860)  92\u00ad93  saw  remains  of  them  at  the  bottom  of the  hill,  near  the  river  bank. 538.

Byz. 522.3)  or (Paus. 9.30.8)  or  (Oikonomos  ( 1915)  no. 4) or (Steph.  Byz. 232.5).  The  form  attested  on coins  (Hatzopoulos  and  Psoma  ( 1999)  10\u00ad12)  has  nothing  to do  with  Makedonian  Dion. In  Ps.-Skylax,  the  chapter  about  Makedonia  ( 66)  opens with    `,  ... Thus,  Dion  is  implicitly  classified as a polis  in  the  urban sense  in  C 4f,  and  explicit  references  are  found  in  later sources,  both  literary  (Paus. 10.13.5  (rC 6l/C5e);  cf.  CID i1) and  epigraphical  (Oikonomos  ( 1915)  no. 4  (early  second century  ad)).  Thuc. 4.78.6  calls  Dion  a  polisma.  The  collec- tive  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  a  C 2e  letter of  Philip  V  to  the  city  (SEG 48  785).  In  the  same  letter  polites occurs  (cf.  the     in  a  Hellenistic  catalogue  of names:  Pandermalis  ( 2002)  381\u00ad82). The  territory of  Classical  Dion  bordered  on  that  of Leibethra  to  the  south,  Pydna  to  the  north-east  and  possibly Phylakai  to  the  north-west.  We  know  the  name  of  only  one of  its  secondary  settlements:  Pimpleia,  called  kome  by Strabo  at  7  fr. 17,which  was  famous  because  of  its  connection with  the  legend  of  Orpheus  and  the  cult  of  the  Muses (Schmidt  ( 1950)). Dion  was  the  religious  centre of  Makedonia  at  least  from C 5  and  probably  much  earlier  (cf.  Diod. 17.16.3).  The  patron deity  of  Dion  was  Olympian  Zeus,  to  whom  the  city  owed  its name  (Just. 24.2.8)  and  who  was  venerated  along  with  the Muses  (Diod. 7.16.3).  Other  communal  cults  were  those  of Demeter,  Dionysos,  the  Mother  of  the  Gods,  Aphrodite, Baubo,  Orpheus,  Athena,  Eileithyia,  Asklepios  and  Hermes. Sarapis  and  Isis  are  also  attested  from  early  Hellenistic  times onwards  (Pandermalis  ( 1977),  ( 1993);  Hatzopoulos  ( 1994b) 800 hatzopoulos  and  paschidis 106).The  most  important  religious  but  also  political  event  at Dion,  and  in  Makedonia  as  a  whole,  was  the  panegyris  of Olympia  held  in  the  month  of  Dios  and  lasting  nine  days (Diod. 17.16.4).  Among  other  contests  it  included  the  pen- tathlon,  the  dolichos  and  the  taurotheria  (Hatzopoulos ( 1996b)  i. 129  n. 2;  cf.  BE  ( 1978)  no. 232).  Dion  maintained close  relations  with  Delphi  from  the  Archaic  period  (CID i1 (C 6/C5e);  cf.  Paus. 10.13.5  and  Mari  ( 2002)  29\u00ad31). From  a  C 4m  fiscal law (Hatzopoulos ( 1996b)  ii.  no. 56) and  a  C 4l  decree  (ibid.  no. 57),  both  unpublished,  we  are informed  that  Dion  had  fewer  than  ten  archontes  and  at  least two  tamiai. The  site  of  Dion  comprises  the  sanctuaries  area  in  the open  plain  and  the  walled  city  to  its  north.  The  latter  occu- pies  an  area  of  c. 43  ha,  which  justifies the descriptions of Thuc. 4.78.6  ( \u00b5) and Livy 44.7.3  (urbem  non  mag- nam).  The  rectangular  grid-line  of  the  street  planning,  leav- ing  an  open  space  for  the  agora,  is  contemporary  with  the erection  of  the  walls  (Stephanidou-Tiveriou  ( 1998)  216\u00ad23). These, 2.60\u00ad3.30  m  wide,  date  from  C 4l  and  were probably built  by  Kassandros  (after  305?).  In their  pre-Roman  phase they  had  a  regular  rectangular  perimeter  of  c. 2,625  m  and about  sixty  towers.  Of  a  probable  total  of  at  least  six  or  seven gates,  four  have  been  identified so far.  One  of  the  northern ones,  leading  to  two  consecutive  courtyards,  was  probably the  main  entry  to  the  city.  The  walls  were  built  from  local  conglomerate  stone.  Above  the  stone  substructure  rose  a  brick  superstructure  of  indeterminate  height (Stephanidou-Tiveriou  ( 1988)). In  the  open  plain  several  sanctuaries  have  been  located: two  megaron-shaped  temples  of  Demeter  adjacent  to  each other  (in  which  the  Mother  of  the  Gods,  Baubo  and Hypolympidia  Aphrodite  were  probably  worshipped  as well)  date  from  C 6l  (Pingiatoglou  ( 1996);  Pandermalis ( 1999)  60\u00ad73);  near  the  theatre  lay  the  small  C 5  temple  of Asklepios  (Pandermalis  ( 1999)  84\u00ad87);  finally,  the  famous temple  and  temenos  of  Olympian  Zeus  has  now  been  locat- ed  in  the  south-eastern  part  of  the  sanctuaries  area (Pandermalis  ( 1999)  44\u00ad59,(2000)  291\u00ad92).  Other  impor- tant  public  buildings  in  the  open  plain  are  the  C 4e  theatre, which  was  rebuilt  in  Hellenistic  times  (Karadedos  ( 1986) 337\u00ad40)  and  the  C 6l  stadion  (Leake  ( 1835)  409  and  now Pandermalis  ( 1999)  76,  80\u00ad81). 535.

It  is  clear,  however,  that  by  the  Roman period  (A)lebaia  was  not  an  independent  polis  but  a  kome  of Elemia,  and  it  is  probable  that  even  earlier  not  (A)lebaia alone  but  the  whole  ethnos  of  the  Elemiotai  constituted  a political  unit  equivalent  to  the  poleis  of  Lower  Makedonia. 531.

Although  Aiane,  as  the  recent  excavations  at  Megale Rachi  have  shown,  was  the  capital  of  the  kings  of  Elemia from  Archaic  times,  it  is  not  mentioned  in  the  surviving  his- torical  works  with  the  possible  exception  of  Livy  43.21.5  in connection  with  the  first military operations of  the  Third Makedonian  War  (Megas  ( 1976)). The  three  monumental  buildings  discovered  on  the  top and  on  the  slopes  of  the  acropolis,  one  of  which  is  certainly a  portico  belonging  to  an  agora  complex,  as  well  as  the urban  planning  of  the  residential  area,  show  that  Aiane  had the  external  aspect  of  a  polis  from  C 6l,  to  which  the  oldest  of these  buildings  belong  (Karamitrou-Mentesidi  ( 1993), ( 1994),  ( 1996a)  16\u00ad32,(1996b)  25\u00ad29).  The  power  of  the Elemiote  kings,  which  in  the  C 4e  equalled  that  of  the Temenids  of  Lower  Makedonia,  goes  a  long  way  to explain the  early  promotion  of  their  residence  to  a  full-blown  city comparable  to  Aigeai.  After  the  annexation  of  Upper makedonia  797 Makedonia  to the  Temenid  kingdom  and  its  reorganisation by  Philip  II,  Aiane  remained  the  capital  of  Elemia,  although from  the  administrative  point  of  view  not  Aiane  alone  but the  whole  of  Elemia  with  its  other  towns  and  villages  consti- tuted  a  political  unit  equal  to  the  poleis  of  Lower  Makedonia (Hatzopoulos  ( 1996b)  ii. 89\u00ad91).

For  the  ear- liest  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic,  see  the  proxenia  decree from  Delphi  (F.Delphes iii.4405.3  (C 4l)). The  territory  of  Europos  bordered  on  those  of  Pella  to  the south-west,  Ichnai  to  the  south-east  and  Gortynia  to  the north. Citizens  of  Europos  received  the  proxenia  at  Delphi (F.Delphes iii.4405.3  (C 4l)).A  cult  of  Artemis  Elaphebolos  is attested  in  a  C 3  inscription  (SEG 43  399).The  Europaians  are recorded  in  the  Argive list  of  contributors  of  C 4l,  which  may be  connected  with  the  dispatching  of  theoroi  (IG iv  617.17;  cf.

Aigeai  is  called  a polis  in  the  urban  sense  by Euphorion  fr. 33,  van  Groningen (rC 7)  and  Plut.  Pyrrh. 26.11  (r 274).  A  combined  description of  the  urban  and  political  aspects  of  the  community  is  found in  the  phrase     (where  asty  is  Aigeai  and the  polis  is  the  Makedonian  state),  referring  to the  founda- tion  of  Aigeai  in  C 7  and  attested  in  a  Delphic  oracle  of  c. 500 (Diod. 7.16;  for  the  date  see  Hatzopoulos  ( 1996b)  464\u00ad65). The  epithet  \u00b5  shows  that  the  toponym  was  used for  the  territory as  well  as  for  the  urban  centre (Steph.  Byz. 39.1;  cf.  Just. 7.1.10).  The  political  sense  is  implicit  in  the  des- ignation  of  Makedonians  as  belonging  to  the  citizen  body  of Aigeai  (cf.  Syll. \u00b3269L  and  I.Magnesia 10.11\u00ad12:  \u00b5[  ]  [   ]  (C 3);  for  the  date,  see Gauthier,  Prakt  ( 1984)  98).  The  earliest  attestation  of  the individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  occurs  in  IG xii.8  206.12 (C 1l),  but  in  Plut.  Alex. 41.9  a  C 4  Makedonian  citizen  is called  . The  territory of  Aigeai  bordered  on  that  of  Beroia  to the west  and  Aloros  to the  east.  The  marshes  of  the  mouth  of the  Haliakmon  formed  its  northern  limit,  and  the  heights  of the  Pierians  its  southern  one.  Thus  it  extended  over  c. 12.5 km  from  the  gorges  of  the  Haliakmon  to the  river-bed  of  the Krasopoulis,  and  over  c. 5  km  of  arable  territory  between  the mountain  and  the  marshes  ( 62.5  km \u00b2).  The  territory of Aigeai  comprised  several  minor  settlements,  of  which  only one  has  been  identified:  Blaganoi  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1987a), ( 1990)  59\u00ad60).  Although  situated  on  the  right  bank  of  the Haliakmon,  Aigeai  did  not  belong  to  Pieria,  but,  just  like Aloros,  to  Bottia  (Diod. 7.16)  or  Emathia  (Ptol.  Geog. 3.12.36),as  this  region  was  called  in  later  times  (Hatzopoulos ( 1996b)  i. 239\u00ad47,(1996a)). According  to  its  foundation  legend,  Aigeai  was  originally a  Phrygian  (Brygian)  city  called  Edessa,  and  the  name  Aigeai was  first g iven  to it  by its  Greek  Makedonian  conquerors (Euphorion  fr. 33,  van  Groningen;  Just. 7.1.10  (rC 7)). From  then  on  it  was  the  Temenid  capital,  and  it  remained  a  part-time  royal  residence  even  after  the  transfer  of  the usual  residence  to  Pella  under  King  Amyntas  III (Hatzopoulos  ( 1987b));  in  particular,  it  retained  its  charac- ter  of  royal  cemetery  at  least  until  the  end  of  the  Temenid dynasty. Citizens  of  Aigeai  are  known  to  have  been  proxenoi  of several  cities:  Delphi  (no. 177)  (Syll. \u00b3269L  (c. 300  or 272)), Histiaia  (no. 372)  (IG xii.9  1187.30  (c. 266))  and  Magnesia  on the  Maiandros  (no. 852),  where  the  recipient  also  received citizenship  (I.Magnesia 10  (C 3)). Aigeai  does  not  appear  in  the  list  of  the  theorodokoi  of Nemea  (in  323),  but  its  name  can  be  safely  restored  on  the Argive  list  of  contributors  (IG iv  617.15  (c. 300)),which  could be  a  reference  to theoroi  (cf.  Perlman  ( 2000)  74).  Its  main deities  were  Zeus  (Arr.  Anab. 1.11.1)  and  Herakles  Patroos (Hatzopoulos  ( 1996b)  ii.  no. 30).  Eukleia  (Saatsoglou- Paliadeli  ( 1987),  ( 1992))  and  the  Mother  of  the  Gods (Drougou  ( 1996))  were  also  popular. Excavations  at  Vergina-Palatitsia,  begun  by  L.  Heuzey  in the  middle  of  the  nineteenth  century  and  continued  since  by C.  Romaios,  and  by  M.  Andronicos  and  his  students,  have unearthed,  besides  the  extensive  cemetery  (Kottaridi ( 2002)),  two  palaces,  a  theatre,  an  agora,  several  sanctuaries and  other  facilities.  The  great  palace  ( 104.5  88.5  m),  built around  a  peristyle  court,  with  porticoes  on  the  north  and east  sides,  an  extended  balcony  beyond  the  north  portico and  a  monumental  gate  on  the  east  side,  belongs  to  the  C 4s, but  the  smaller  one,  to  the  west,  seems  to  be  earlier  and  may  be  the  very  structure  decorated  by  Zeuxis  in  C 5l (Andronicos  ( 1984)  38\u00ad46;  Ginouv\u00e8s  ( 1993)  84\u00ad88; Saatsoglou-Paliadeli  ( 2001)).  The  C 4s  theatre  (TGR  ii. 317) lay  immediately  to  the  north  of  the  palace.  Stone  benches rose  only  to  the  second  row  (Drougou  ( 1997)).The  theatre  is mentioned  by  Diodorus  in  his  account  of  the  murder  of Philip  in  336  (Diod. 16.92.5ff).The  agora  of  the  city  lay  to the north  of  the  theatre;  it  comprised  the  C 4m  temple  dedicat- ed  to  Eukleia  (Saatsoglou-Paliadeli  ( 1996)).  To  the  north- east  of  the  palace  a  sanctuary  of  the  Mother  of  the  Gods  was discovered,  the  earliest  building  phase  of  which  belongs  to C 4l  (Drougou  ( 1996)). 798 hatzopoulos  and  paschidis On  the  acropolis,  south  of  the  palace,  which  dominated the  city,  no  major  public  buildings  have  been  found (Phaklaris  ( 1996)  70\u00ad74). The  C 4l  circuit  wall  roughly  forms  a  triangle,  with  its  apex to  the  south  on  the  acropolis  and  its  base  on  a  line  joining the  two  streams  on  either  side  of  the  acropolis  hill  probably to  the  south  of  the  Rhomaios  tomb.  It  is  a  pseudo-isodomic structure  of  local  stone  with  towers  at  irregular  intervals. Monumental  gates  opened  from  the  acropolis  to  the  south, towards  Pieria,  to  the  north  towards  the  city,  and  west  of  the theatre  towards  Upper  Makedonia  (Andronicos  et al.( 1983) 42\u00ad45,(1987)  146\u00ad48;  Phaklaris  ( 1996)  69\u00ad70). According  to  legend,  Aigeai  was  founded  by  the  Temenid Perdikkas  or  Karanos  or  Archelaos,  alone  or  with  an  army  of Argive  colonists  in  the  C 7m  or  C 8e  (Hammond  and  Griffith ( 1979)  3\u00ad14). 530.

The  constitution  of  Edessa  is  known to us  only  from inscriptions  of  the  Roman  period  (e.g.  SEG 24  531.6  ( ad 180/1)),  which  is  also  the  earliest  attested  public  enactment; Antoninus ( 1879)  227,no.26).Edessaians  were  granted  prox- enia  by  Delphi  (F.Delphes iii.3207.2  (C 3m))  and  Haliartos (IG vii  2848.4  (C 3?)),  and  received  citizenship  from  Larisa (SEG 27  202  ( 220\u00ad210)).  Edessa  is  recorded  on  the  Argive  list of  contributors  of  C 4l,  which  may  be  connected  with  the dispatching  of  theoroi  (IG iv  617.16;  cf.  Perlman  ( 2000)  74). The  cult  of  Herakles  is  mentioned  by  Hesychius,  s.v. ' ,  and  is  attested  epigraphically  (Struck  ( 1902) 310  no. 15  and,  with  the  epithet  Kynagidas,  in  two  unpublished  C 2s  and  C 1m  inscriptions).  From  the  same period  date  inscriptions  referring  to  the  cults  of Zeus  Hypsistos  (P.  Chrysostomou  ( 1989\u00ad91)  30\u00ad34)  and Parthenos  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1995)).  Evidence  for  other  cults  is of  later  date. A  probably  C 4l  (A.  Chrysostomou  ( 1988)  60,(1996)  174) wall  enclosed  both  the  acropolis  (triangular  perimeter,  one tower  on  the  north-west  apex of  the  triangle  and  one  on each  of  the  west  and  north  sides)  and  the  lower  city  (polyg- onal  perimeter, 2.4\u00ad3  m  wide)  covering  an  area  of 3.5  and 23 ha  respectively  (A.  Chrysostomou  ( 1987),  ( 1996)).  The  walls are  mentioned  by  Polyaen. 2.29.2  (r 274).  The  only  public monuments  known  are  the  temple  of  Ma  and  its  stoas, which  are  epigraphically  attested  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1995)  126). The  site  has  been  occupied  continuously  since  the  Bronze Age,  which  accounts  for  the  lack  of  Archaic  and  Classical remains  (A.  Chrysostomou  ( 1996)  180\u00ad82);  however,  Livy 45.30.5  refers  to Edessa  as  among  the  urbes  nobiles  of  central Makedonia  in  167,  and  it  was  presumably  already  so  in  the Classical  period. makedonia  801 536.

The  toponym  is ,  (Thuc. 6.7.3;  IG ii\u00b2  130), (IG iv\u00b2.1 94.ib.8).  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  61;  Thuc. 4.129.4;  Arist.  frr. 551\u00ad52).  Methone  is  called  a  polis  both  in the  urban  sense  (Dem. 9.26;  Ps.-Skylax 66)  and  in  the  polit- ical  sense  (IG i\u00b3  61.44\u00ad45;Plut.  Mor. 293B,  probably  derived from  Aristotle's  treatise).  In  Din. 1.14  polis  is  used  in  both senses  simultaneously.  The  politai  of  Methone  are  men- tioned  in  Diod. 16.34.5  (r 354),  and  there  was  an  Aristotelian Methonaion  politeia  (frr. 551\u00ad52).  The  collective use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  abbreviated  form  on coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  IG i\u00b3  61.1.  For  the  individual and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic,  see  e.g.  IG ii\u00b2  9330  (C 5l). According  to  Thuc. 6.7.3,  Methone  bordered  on Makedonia  (    \u00b5 ),  and  its  territory ( ~  ~ []) is mentioned in IG  i\u00b3  61.22. The  territory of  Classical  Methone  bordered  on  that  of Pydna  to the  south  and  Aloros  to the  north-west.  The  size  of the  territory  must  have  been  close  to  100  km \u00b2,  perhaps  a  lit- tle  more.  After  354  it  must  have  been  added  to  that  of  Pydna (Hatzopoulos  ( 1996b)  i. 181). Methone  was  originally  a  Thracian  settlement.  It  was colonised  by  Eretrians  c. 730  (Hammond  ( 1972)  425\u00ad26)  and joined  the  Delian  League  after  431  (for  the  date  and  the  erro- neous  restoration  of  the  ethnic  in  IG i\u00b3  280.ii.67,  see  Pi\u00e9rart ( 1988)).  It  belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and  is  registered in  the  tribute  lists  from  430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.ii.33,  restored)  to 415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.iii.8)  a  total  of  three  times,  paying  a  phoros of 3  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.53).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4 (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.157  ( 5  tal.),  ethnic  completely  restored). In 364  or 363  it  was  captured  by  the  Athenian  Timotheos (Din. 1.14  3.17)  and  became  an  ally  of  Athens  but  probably without  becoming  a  member  of  the  Second  Athenian  Naval League  (Dreher  ( 1995)  26).  Methone  was  conquered  and destroyed  by  Philip  II  in  354  (Dem. 4.4;Diod.  16.31.6  and 34.4\u00ad5).  The  inhabitants  were  allowed  to  leave  the  city  with one  garment  each;  the  city  itself  was  razed  to  the  ground, and  its  territory distributed  to Makedonian  settlers.  A  few decades  later,  old  Methone  was  succeeded  by  a  new  settle- ment 1  km  to  the  north-west  of  the  former  city,  which,  how- ever,  did  not  enjoy  the  status  of  polis  but  was  probably  a kome  of  Pydna  (Hatzopoulos  et al.( 1990);  for  the  origin  of the  new  settlers,  see  Hatzopoulos  ( 1996b)  i. 180\u00ad81). Our  only  information  about  the  constitutional  arrange- ments  of  Methone  concerns  its  magistrates,  the  archontes and  the  polemarchos  mentioned  in  Arist.  fr. 551.A Methonaian  theorodokos  hosted  the  theoroi  from  Epidauros (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.194.b.8)  c. 360.  Another  Methonaian  is known  to  have  been  granted  citizenship  in  Ephesos (I.Ephesos 48  (C 4l)). Methone  was  a  walled  city  in  354  (Dem. 1.9;Theopomp. fr. 52;  Polyaen. 4.2.15;  Just.  Epit. 7.6.14).  No  remains  of  the walls  are  visible  today. Methone  struck  only  one  type  of  bronze  coinage  in  C 4f.

Byz. 452.1  (perhaps  quoting Theagenes  (FGrHist 774)  fr. 7)  is  probably  an  epithet.  The city-ethnic  is  (Theagenes  (FGrHist 774)  fr. 7), later  spelt  ~  (I.Leukopetra 71.8\u00ad9),  or  (Arr. Ind. 18.6  (r 325)). Mieza  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Steph.  Byz. 452.1,possibly  quoting  Theagenes  (FGrHist 774)  fr. 7  (C 3);  cf. Ptol.  Geog. 3.12.36  (cf. 17).  For  the  individual  use  of  the  city- ethnic,  see  Arr.  Ind. 18.6. The  territory  of  Mieza  is  called  ~   in I.Leukopetra 71.8\u00ad9;  we  know  the  names  of  two  settlements that  were probably  its  komai,  Gaimeion  and  Nea  [---]  (SEG 24  524  (C 3)).  It bordered  on  the  territory of  Beroia  to the south,  Marinia  to  the  north-west,  and  Skydra  to  the  north- east. Among  the  magistrates,  the  eponymous  priest  of Asklepios,  the  epistates,  tagoi  and  dikastai  are  attested  in  the Hellenistic  period  (SEG 24  524  (C 2f)),  and  at  least  the  priest of  Asklepios  and  the  epistates  are  likely  to  have  existed  since C 4  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1996b)  i. 156).The  cults  of  Asklepios  (SEG 24  524  (C 2f)),  the  Nymphs  (Plut.  Alex. 7.4),Artemis  (SEG 24 525\u00ad26),  Herakles  Kallinikos  (Demitsas  ( 1896)no.  18)  and the  river  god  Olganos  (Kallipolitis  ( 1952))  are  attested  in Mieza. Although  the  archaeological  complex  of  Leukadia\u00ad Kopanos\u00adNaoussa  was  well  known  from  the  nineteenth century,  only  most  recently  have  excavations  started  at  the very  site  of  the  ancient  city  (Rhomiopoulou  ( 1997)).  A  large 804 hatzopoulos  and  paschidis (over  106  m  long)  C 4  stoa,  which  might  form  part  of  a Asklepieion  complex,  has  come  to  light  (Allamani-Souri and  Misaelidou  ( 1992)  203\u00ad12;Allamani-Souri  et  al.  ( 2002)). Moreover,  the  school  that  Aristotle  founded  in  Mieza  (Plut. Alex. 7.4)  is  almost  certainly  to  be  identified w ith  the  build- ing  complex  at  Isvoria,  to  the  south-west  of  the  civic  centre, where  three  caves  are  joined  by  elaborate  peripatoi,  niches, stoas  and  staircases  (Siganidou  and  Trochides  ( 199o),  with earlier  refs.). 543.Pella  (Pellaios) Maps  49\u00ad50.

Pella  is  called  a polis  in  the  urban  sense  in  Hdt. 7.123.3  and  Ps.-Skylax  66.At Xen.  Hell. 5.2.13, \u00b5       is used  about  Pella  both  in  the  personal-political  and  in  the urban  sense.  The  earliest  attestation  of  polis  in  a  purely  polit- ical  sense  is  in  the  asylia  decree  for  Kos  (SEG 12  374.9  ( 243)). In  a  verse  dedication  of  Queen  Eurydika,  wife  of  Amyntas  II, is  used  about  the  female  citizens,  presumably  of Pella  (Plut.  Mor. 14B  with  BE  ( 1984)  249).  Pella  is  called  a polisma  in  App.  Syr. 57  and  a  metropolis  in  Strabo  16.2.10.Ps.- Skylax 66  writes:         (C 4m). is  used  about  Pella  in  a  C 4s  epigram  from  Delphi (SEG 18  222a),  in  AG 7.139  (C 1)  and  in  Strabo  16.2.10. Demosthenes'  description  of  Pella  as  a     ...  \u00b5  ( 18.68  (rC 4e))  is  clearly  a  rhetorical  distortion (cf.  Xen.  Hell. 5.2.13).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  internally  in  the  C 2f  coinage  of  the  city  (Gaebler ( 1935)  93\u00ad97)  and  externally  in  the  asylia  decree  for  Kos  (SEG 12  374  ( 243)).  For  the  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic,  see Arr.  Ind. 18.3  (r 325),  and  Arvanitopoulos  ( 1909)  no. 16  (C 3e). Pella's extensive territory, (Strabo  7  fr. 20),  bor- dered  on  the  territories  of  Allante  to  the  south-east,  Ichnai  to the  east,  Tyrissa  to  the  north,  and  Kyrrhos  to  the  north-west and  to  the  west.  We  know  the  sites  of  five secondary settle- ments,  at  Archontikon,  Damianon  B,  Agrosykia,  Leptokarya B  and  Ag.  Nikolaos  (Krya  Vrysi),  and  two  suburbs,  one  to  the north-west  and  one  to  the  west  of  the  city  (P.  Chrysostomou ( 1990);  Hatzopoulos  ( 1996b)  i. 111\u00ad12). Pella,  originally  a  Paionian  settlement,  received  an  impor- tant  Ionian  influx from early A rchaic  times.  It  became  a member  of  the  Chalkidian  Federation  for  a  brief  period  in the 380s  (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.13).  The  transfer  of  the  royal  resid- ence  to  the  city  in  the  reign  of  Amyntas  III  was  accompanied by  a  significant M akedonian  migration  which  transformed the  character  of  the  city,  as  the  onomastics  and  the  archaeo- logical  remains  show  (Hammond  and  Griffith ( 1979)  56; Hatzopoulos  ( 1996b)  i. 171\u00ad73). There  is  no  evidence  for  the  Classical  constitution  of Pella;  in  C 3  there  is  evidence  of  an  archon,an  epistates  (SEG 48  818),  a  boule  and  a  demos  (SEG 48  817)  as  well  as  tamiai (SEG 12  374).  In  C 4s  (Syll. \u00b3267;  SEG 18  222a)  and  in  C 3m (F.Delphes iii.3207.2)  several  citizens  of  Pella  received  the proxenia  of  Delphi. The  patron  divinity  of  Pella  was  Athena  Alkidemos  (Livy 42.51.2;  cf.  Gaebler  ( 1935)  93\u00ad97).  Among  other  cults,  those of  Apollo,  Artemis,  Asklepios,  Dionysos,  Zeus  Meilichios, Herakles  Kynagidas,  Herakles  Phylakos,  the  Muses  and  Pan are  attested  from  epigraphic,  literary  and  archaeological sources  (SEG 24  540;  Papakonstantinou-Diamantourou ( 1971)  38\u00ad51;  P.  Chrysostomou  ( 1989)  105\u00ad6).  Moreover,  the C 4l  sanctuaries  of  the  Mother  of  the  Gods,  of  Demeter  and of  Darron  have  been  uncovered  in  or  near  the  city (Lilimpaki-Akamati  ( 1987),  ( 1990),  ( 1991),  ( 1996),  ( 2000), ( 2002)).  For  none  of  the  cults  do  we have evidence  from  the Classical  period.  A  Pellaian  theorodokos  was  appointed  to host  theoroi  from  Nemea  (SEG 36  331.B.23\u00ad24  ( 323\u00ad317);  for the  identification of  the  theorodokos,see Knoepfler ( 2001) 187\u00ad90).A  citizen  of  Pella  was  victorious  in  the  Isthmian  and Pythian  Games  (SEG 18  222a  (C 4s)). Pella  was  the  largest  city  of  Makedonia;  for  a  general description,  see  Lilimpaki-Akamati  ( 2002).  The  rectangular C 4s  wall  is  of  mudbrick  upon  a  stone  foundation  and  pre- dates  the  C 4l  grid  plan  of  the  town  (Siganidou  ( 1987a)).  The city  had  two  citadels.  The  acropolis,  situated  on  the  north- ern  hill  and  covering  an  area  of 6  ha,  is  entirely  occupied  by the  palatial  complex.  At  the  southern  end  of  the  city  the  islet Phakos  in  Lake  Loudiake,  which  was  connected  with  the mainland  via  a  drawbridge,  qualified as an  and housed the  central  Makedonian  treasury  (Strabo  7  fr. 20).  The  city was  built  on  a  regular  Hippodamian  grid  line  with  two  main north\u00adsouth  roads  and  one  west\u00adeast  road  crossing  them  in the  agora  area  (Siganidou  ( 1990)).  The  200 182  m-wide agora  is  surrounded  by stoas:  the  north  one  probably housed  the  seat  of  the  politarchs,  while  on  the  north-west side  of  the  agora  probably  lay  the  city  archive;  along  with  the building  complex  around  it,  the  agora  covers  an  area  of  ten blocks  in  the  centre  of  the  city  (Akamatis  ( 1999)).The  palace of  the  Makedonian  kings  (central  complex  C 4f)  covers  the entire  acropolis  area  ( 6  ha)  north  of  the  agora.  It consists  of makedonia  805 three  building  complexes,  along  an  east\u00adwest  axis.  Each building  complex  is  composed  of  two  buildings,  one  to  the south,  towards  the  city,  and  one  to  the  north.  All  three southern  buildings  have  a  large  peristyle  court.  The  north- ern  buildings  of  the  west  and  central  complex  have  bathing facilities.  A  long  stoa  of  more  than  153  m  with  a  15  m-wide propylon  forms  the  southern  fa\u00e7ade  of  the  central  and  east complex  facing  the  city  (Siganidou  ( 1987b),  ( 1996); Ginouv\u00e8s  ( 1994)  88\u00ad91;  P.  Chrysostomou  ( 1996)).  Other public  buildings  uncovered  are  a  large  C 4l  tholos,  probably a  heroon  of  Herakles  and  used  as  bouleuterion  by  the Makedonian  Council  (Hadzisteliou-Price  ( 1973))  and  the sanctuaries  of  the  Mother  of  the  Gods  and  Aphrodite  in the  agora  area,  of  Demeter  in  the  south-east  quarter  of  the city,  and  of  Darron  in  the  south-west  quarter  (Lilimbaki- Akamati  ( 1987),  ( 1990),  ( 1991),  ( 1996),  ( 2000)).  A  theatre  is mentioned  by  Plutarch  in  a  C 4s  context  (Mor. 1096B). 544. "}, "Argolis": {"Epidauros": "Identifier: 349. , (Epidaurios) Map  58.  Lat. 37.40,long. 23.10.

The  individual  use  is found  internally  in  a  dedication  of  an  Epidaurian  (SEG 11 438  (C 4s))  and  externally  at  Delphi,  where  an  Epidaurian made  a  dedication  to  Apollo  in  C 5  (F.Delphes iii.4  195) and  an  Astias  of  Epidauros  served  as  naopoios  in 356/5  (CID ii  31.35),  and  in  Olympia  on  a  monument  commemorating the  Olympic  victor  Aristion  (IvO 165  (C 4m);  Olympionikai 415).

The  frontier  between  Epidauros  and  Troizen  (no. 357)  was  near  Methana  (no. 352)  (Thuc. 4.45.2);  to  the  west, the  frontier  towards  Argos  (no. 347)  was  at  Mt.  Arachnaion. The  Epidaurians  possessed  part  of  the  coast  of  the  Argolic Gulf  but  had  no  harbour  there  (Ps.-Skylax  50).A  C 5  dedica- tion  found  in  the  Iria  plain  indicates  that  the  plain  belonged to  Epidauros  (SEG 24  274;  cf.

In 480  Epidauros  provided  eight  triremes  at  Artemision (Hdt. 8.1.2)  and  ten  at  Salamis  (Hdt. 8.43),as  well  as  800  men at  Plataiai  in  479  (Hdt. 9.28.4).  Assuming  that  there  is  no overlap  between  the  forces,  Jameson  et al.( 1994)  556\u00ad59  esti- mates  the  military  strength  of  Troizen  at  2,800  men,  and  the total  population  at  c. 16,000  minimum  and  23,500  maxi- mum. Epidauros  was  a  member  of  the  Kalaurian  amphiktyony (Strabo  8.6.14;  Tausend  ( 1992)  12\u00ad19).  In  C 5e,  after  the  Argive  defeat  at  Sepeia,  Epidauros  gave  shelter  to  some Argive  refugees  (SEG 26  449  Nomima ii  28  (C 5f);  cf. Lambrinoudakis  ( 1990)). Epidauros  fought  on  the  Greek  side  in  the  Persian  War (Hdt. 8.1.2,  43,  9.28.4),  and  is  recorded  on  the  Serpent Column  in  Delphi  (ML  27.4)  and  in  Olympia  (Paus. 5.23.1\u00ad2).  It  was  a  member  of  the  Peloponnesian  League (Thuc. 5.57.1).  Alongside  the  Corinthians  they  defeated  the Athenians  at  Halieis  in  460/59  (Thuc. 1.105.1).  In  435  the Epidaurians  supported  Corinth  (no. 227)  against  Korkyra (no. 123)  with  five t riremes  (Thuc. 1.27.2).  From  430  the Athenians  ravaged  the  territory  of  Epidauros  (Thuc. 2.56.4\u00ad5,  4.45.2,  6.31.2). Controlling  a  territory  which  bordered  on  the  Gulf  of Argos  but  also  had  an  excellent  harbour  on  the  Saronic  Gulf, Epidauros  occupied  a  strategic  position  and  was  an  indis- pensable  link  in  all  relations  between  Athens  (no. 361)  and 606 pi\u00e9rart Argos  (no. 347).  A  war  between  Argos  and  Epidauros  was fought  in  419\u00ad418,  caused  by  a  sacrifice o wed  by  the Epidaurians  to  Apollo  Pythaios  (Thuc. 5.53.1).  The  territory of  Epidauros  was  repeatedly  plundered  by  the  Argives (Thuc. 5.54.3\u00ad55.4).  The  Epidaurians  received  a Lakedaimonian  garrison,  and  an  Argive  attack  on  the  town was  called  off  (Thuc. 5.56).  After  the  battle  of  Mantinea,  the Athenians,  being  allied  with  the  Argives,  built  a  blockading wall  around  the  town  of  Epidauros,  but  in  418/17  a  peace  was concluded  between  Lakedaimon  and  Argos  in  which  it  was stipulated  that  the  blockading  wall  be  pulled  down  and  the Argive  and  Athenian  troops  withdrawn  from  the  territory  of Epidauros  (Thuc. 5.77.1).  After  the  Athenian  defeat  at Syracuse,  Epidauros  took  an  active  part  in  the  mobilisation of  a  Peloponnesian  fleet ( Thuc. 8.3.2),  and  after  the  battle  of Aigos  potamoi  in  405,  a  statue  was  set  up  in  Delphi  of  the commander  of  the  Epidaurian  squadron  (Paus. 10.9.10). Epidauros  fought  on  the  Spartan  side  in  the  battle  of  Nemea (Xen.  Hell. 4.2.16)  and  remained  loyal  to  Sparta  (no. 345) even  after  the  battle  of  Leuktra (Xen.  Hell. 6.2.3,7.2.2).In  369 Epaminondas  ravaged  the  territory  of  Epidauros  but  failed to  conquer  the  city  (Diod. 15.69.1).  Alongside  Sparta  and other  members  of  the  Peloponnesian  League,  Epidauros concluded  an  alliance  with  Athens  in  370/69  (Xen.  Hell. 7.1.1, 2.2;  Arist.  Rh. 1411a11\u00ad13;  cf.  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 274);  but  in  366/5 Epidauros  appears  as  an  ally  of  Thebes  (no. 221)  (Isoc. 6.91; cf.  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 285).  After  the  battle  of  Chaironeia  in  338, Epidauros  may  have become  a  dependency  of  Argos (Burford  ( 1969)  17),and  there  may  have  been  an  Argive  kler- ouchy  in  Epidauros  (IG iv\u00b2.169  and  SEG 11  400,  if  restored: [ ]  \u00b5   [ \u00b5       '] [.  ]  []).  Epidauros  joined  the revolt  against  Makedonia  after  the  death  of  Alexander  the Great  (Diod. 18.11.2). In C 5s  the  sanctuary  of  Asklepios  transformed  Epidauros into  a  Panhellenic  site  visited  by  pilgrims  from  all  parts. Contacts  with  other  poleis  increased  because  of  the  pilgrims and  the  erection  of  monumental  buildings  in  the  sanctuary. Construction  began  in  the  second  quarter  of  C 4,  and  the accounts  mention  heralds  sent  not  only  to  neighbouring poleis  but  even  to  some  more  remote  cities,  such  as  Athens, Tegea  (no. 297)  and  Thebes  (no. 221)  (IG iv\u00b2.1102,  103),  from which  artisans  came  to  Epidauros  (Burford  ( 1969)  16\u00ad18). From  the  350s,  inscriptions  attest  to  the  sending  out  of  theo- roi  and  the  appointment  of  theorodokoi  in  other  poleis.We have preserved  lists  of  theorodokoi  in  the  various  poleis recorded  region  by  region  in  accordance  with  the  itinerary of  the  theoroi  (IG iv\u00b2.194\u00ad95  Perlman  ( 2000)  E 1\u00ad2  ( 350s)), decrees  endowing  individuals  with  the  title  of  theorodokos, sometimes  connected  with  the  title  of  proxenos  (SEG 26 445  Perlman  ( 2000)  E 12  p. 200  (C 4m)),  and  chronologi- cally  organised  surveys  of  such  decrees  passed  by  the Epidaurians  (IG iv\u00b2.196  Perlman  ( 2000)  E 3  (C 3f)).For  an account  of  the  institution  of  theorodokia,  see  Perlman ( 2000)  81\u00ad95.  Citizens  of  Epidauros  were  appointed  prox- enoi  by  Karthaia  (no. 492)  (IG xii.4542.15\u00ad16  (C 4m))  and Megara (no. 225)  (IG vii  13  (C 4l)). The  Aristotelian  collection  of  politeiai  included  a  consti- tution  of  the  Epidaurians  (Arist.  fr. 498),  and  the  first entry in  Plutarch's Aitia  Graeca  may  stem  from  this  work:  there were  in  Epidauros  180  enfranchised  citizens;  they  constitut- ed  the  politeuma  from  which  were  elected  the  councillors (bouleutai),  in  Epidauros  called  artynoi.  Most  of  the  com- mon  people  were  settled  in  the  countryside  and  nicknamed ,  i.e.  those  with  dust  on  their  feet  (Plut.  Mor. 291E).  No  date  is  indicated,  but  the  narrow  politeuma  points to  an  oligarchy  in  the  Archaic  period.  In  C 7s  Epidauros  was ruled  by  a  tyrant  called  Prokles,  whose  daughter  was  mar- ried  to Periander,  the  tyrant  of  Corinth  (no. 227)  (Hdt. 3.50\u00ad52).  The  numerous  decrees  passed  in  C 4  by boule  and demos  (Rhodes,  DGS 74)  point  to  a  democratic  constitution. The  Epidaurians  were  Dorians  (Hdt. 1.146.1,  7.99.2\u00ad3), and  in  C 4  the  citizens  were  organised  into  four  phylai:two of the  old  Dorian  phylai,  Dymanes  and  Hylleis,  and  two  other phylai,  Azantioi  and  Hysminatai  (IG iv\u00b2.1  106.iii.37\u00ad40 (C 4)).  The  subdivision  into  phylai  was  applied  in  the  work- ing  of  political  institutions,  the  composition  of  boards  of officials,  and  the  organisation  of  the  army.  The  four  phylai were  further  subdivided  into  at  least  thirty-nine  territorial units  (Jones,  POAG 107\u00ad11;  Perlman  ( 2000)  85\u00ad87).  The names  of  these  units  were  used  as  sub-ethnics  to  identify Epidaurian  citizens)  (see  IG iv\u00b2.158.5: \u00b5 ).  The  combination  of  a  personal  and  a  territori- al  subdivision  of  the  citizenry  remains  problematic.  Perhaps the  citizens  were  reassigned  to  the  various  phylai  in  accor- dance  with  their  place  of  residence. In C 4  decrees  were  passed  by  the  boule  and  the  demos  and authenticated  by  a  magistrate  called  (SEG 26  445  (C 4m);  cf.  Rhodes,  DGS 73\u00ad74).  The  priest  of Asklepios  served  as  eponymous  official ( IG iv\u00b2.1103;  cf. Sherk  ( 1990)  267\u00ad68).  The  Epidaurian  calendar  was  of  the Doric  type,  and  all  months  are  attested  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 140\u00ad43). At  Ps.-Skylax 54  (cf.  Paus. 2.29.1)  the  urban  centre  is described  as    \u00b5.It lay on the Saronic Gulf  west of  Aigina  (no. 358)  and  the  peninsula  of  Methana  (no. 352). argolis  607 The  remains  are  partly  submerged  and  have  not  been  sys- tematically  explored.  The  town  occupied  a  peninsula  con- sisting  of  two  hills,  Nisi,  with  a  harbour  on  either  side. Pausanias  saw  six  temples  in  the  town,  on  the  acropolis  and near  the  harbour  ( 2.29.1).  The  theatre  was  situated  on  the western  slope  of  the  acropolis  and  has  been  excavated (Deilaki-Protonotariou  ( 1972),  ( 1973)).  It  dates  to  C 4\u00adHell. (TGR  ii. 213),  accommodated  some  5,000\u00ad6,000  persons, and  had  seats  inscribed  with  the  names  of  magistrates  and citizens  of  the  period  c. 350\u00ad200  (SEG 26  452).  A  boundary stone  inscribed     found  on  the  neck  of  the peninsula  indicates  that  the  agora  was  near  the  theatre  (SEG 26  452).  Epidauros  was  fortified in C 5  (Thuc. 5.56.5,  75.5). The  sanctuary  of  Asklepios  was  situated  inland  some  9 km  south  of  the  harbour.  The  peak  of  Mt.  Kynortion,  which rises  behind  the  theatre,  was  consecrated  to  Apollo Maleatas,  whose  sanctuary  was  believed  to  be  very  old  (Paus. 2.27.7).  The  remains  indicate  that  it  was  in  continuous  use from  C 7s  onwards  (Paus. 2.27.7;  Lambrinoudakis  ( 1980)). Apollo  Maleatas  was  persistently  associated  with  Asklepios, originally  a  hero  with  healing  powers,  later  worshipped  as the  god  of  medicine  and  the  tutelary  god  of  Epidauros (Paus. 2.26.3).  His  cult  can  be  traced  back  to  C 6  (IG iv\u00b2.1136 (C 6l/C5e)).  From  C 4f  onwards  the  Epidaurians  implement- ed  an  ambitious  building  programme.  The  accounts  are partially  preserved  (IG iv\u00b2.1102\u00ad20  (C 4\u00adC3e)).  Famous architects  and  sculptors  were  invited,  among  them Polykleitos  the  Younger,  allegedly  responsible  for  the  plans of  the  theatre (TGR  ii. 208\u00ad10)  and  the  tholos  (Paus. 2.27\u00ad8.1; cf.  Roux  ( 1961);  Burford  ( 1969)). Several  Epidaurian  citizens  were  victorious  in  the Olympic  Games  (Olympionikai 19  ( 712),  74  ( 608),  77  ( 600), 223  ( 472),  415  ( 368)).  Participation  in  the  Nemean  Games  is indicated  by  the  city's  possession  of  an  oikos  in  Nemea  (SEG 26  420;  Miller  ( 1990)  71,  119).  The  Asklepiaia  can  be  traced back  to C 6l  through  the  victory  in  boxing  and  pankration won  by  Themistios,  the  ancestor  of  Pytheas  of  Aigina,  who was  active c. 490\u00ad480  (Pind.  Nem. 5.53).  Whereas  Apollo Maleatas  is  closely  associated  with  Asklepios  in  the  healing inscriptions,  there  is  no  connection  with  the  Games  before C 3m  (Perlman  ( 2000)  82).  In  the  beginning  the  Games mostly  attracted  local  contestants,  but  in  C 4  they  acquired Panhellenic  status.  Thus,  the  rhapsode  Ion  of  Ephesos  (no. 844)  took  part  in  the  games  c. 390  (Pl.  Io 530B;  cf.  S\u00e8ve ( 1993)). Epidauros  struck  coins  of  silver  and  bronze  from  c. 350 onwards.  ( 1)  Silver  on  the  Aiginetan  standard,  c. 350\u00ad323  or later;  denominations:  drachm,  hemidrachm,  obol,  tetarte- morion;  types:  obv.  head  of  Asklepios  laureate;  rev. or  within  laurel  wreath;  or  obv.  head  of  Apollo;  rev.

According  to  Hdt. 7.99.3,  Epidauros  colonised  Kos  (no. 499),  Nisyros  (no. 508)  and  Kalymna  (no. 485);  in  the Archaic  period  the  Epidaurians  controlled  Aigina  (no. 358; Hdt. 5.83.1). 349.

The  name  of  the  harbour  was  ,  and  the  Greek  fleet rallied  there  before  the  battle  of  Salamis  (Hdt. 8.42.1;Strabo 8.6.14). The  foundation  myth,  like  that  of  Athens,  involved  both Athena  and  Poseidon.  According  to Paus. 2.30.6,  the  myth was  reflected in the oldest t ypes  of  Troizenian  coins,  which combined  the  head  of  Athena  with  the  trident  of  Poseidon. Troizen  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Attic  standard  from  c. 460 onwards.  Denominations:  drachm,  pentobol,  triobol, diobol,  obol.  Types:  obv.  head  of  Athena  facing,  or  head  of Apollo  (Thearios?);  rev.  trident,  sometimes  in  incuse square;  legend: (Head,  HN \u00b2443;  SNG  Cop.  Argolis 156\u00ad59). Troizen  was  the  metropolis  of  Halikarnassos  (no. 886) (Hdt. 7.99.3;  IG iv  750  Bielman  ( 1994)  19.27\u00ad28),  Myndos (no. 914)  (Paus. 2.30.9)  and  Theangela  (no. 931)  (Robert, Coll.  Froehner 53  Bielman  ( 1994)  40.5\u00ad6  (c. 200)). Continued  close  relations  between  the  colonies  and  their metropolis  are  attested  in  several  inscriptions  (Wilhelm ( 1974)  i. 39;  Rostovtzeff  ( 1931);  Bielman  ( 1994)  19,  40,  43). Furthermore,  in  collaboration  with  Achaians  from  Helike (no. 235),  the  Troizenians  colonised  Sybaris  (no. 70),  but were  soon  expelled  (Arist.  Pol. 1303a29\u00ad30)  and  founded Poseidonia  (no. 66)  instead  (B\u00e9rard  ( 1957)  215\u00ad17). argolis  617", "Mykenai": "Identifier: 355. , (Mykenaios) Map  58.  Lat. 37.45,long.  22.45. Size of  territory: 2?  Type:  A.  The  Doric  form  of  the  toponym argolis  611 is ,  (IG iv  498.11;  cf.  Mitsos  ( 1949)  74)  or,  in  the plural, ,  (Pind.  Pyth. 4.49).  In the  Ionic  dialect the  toponym  is  (Hom.  Il. 4.52,  7.180,  11.46);  in  later literature,  however,  the  preferred  form  is  in  the plural  (Pind.  Pyth. 4.49;Eur.  Heracl. 85;  Thuc. 1.10.1;Diod. 11.65.5;Strabo 8.6.10),  first attested in the Catalogue of  Ships (Hom.  Il. 569).  The  Doric  form  of  the  city-ethnic  is (ML 27.7  ( 479);  IG iv  497  (C 2e));  in  literature  it  is (Hom.  Il. 15.638;  Hdt. 7.202;Eur.  Heracl. 187; Thuc. 1.9.2).  The  collective  and  external  use  of  the  city- ethnic  is  attested  in  inscriptions  (ML  27.7)  and  in  literature (Hdt. 7.202).  The  individual  use  of  the  adverbial  equivalent is  attested  internally  (IG iv  492.1\u00ad2: h  ;  cf.  SEG 40  334  (C 5e)). Mykenai  is  referred  to  as  being  a  polis  in  a  bronze  plaque of  C 5e  (IG iv  492.3,  cf.  SEG 40  334: '             ),  where  polis  is  used  either  in  the sense  of  acropolis  (Lambrinoudakis  ( 1990)  180)  or  in  the urban  sense  (Marcad\u00e9  apud  Lambrinoudakis  ( 1990) 183\u00ad85).  Mykenai  is  not  called  a  polis  in  any  other  Archaic  or Classical  source,  but  retrospectively  by  Diod. 11.65.5  (r 468) and  Paus. 5.23.3  (r 480).  Polis  status  in  the  political  sense  is strongly  indicated  by  the  role  Mykenai  played  in  the  Persian War.  At  Hdt. 7.202.1  and 204.1  the  Mykenaians  are  listed among  the  poleis  that  defended  Thermopylai,  and  they  are mentioned  on  the  Serpent  Column  in  Delphi  (ML  27.7). There  is  no  clue  to the  problem  of  whether  Mykenai  was  a dependent  polis  in  the  Archaic  period  (Pi\u00e9rart  ( 1997)).  In  the Hellenistic  period  Mykenai  was  a  kome  of  Argos  (no. 347) (IG iv  498.2  (C 3\u00adC2)). After  the  battle  of  Sepeia,  Mykenai  dissociated  itself  from Argos.  It provided  80  men  at  Thermopylai  in  480  (Hdt. 7.202)  and,  together  with  Tiryns  (no. 356),  400  men  at Plataiai  in  479  (Hdt. 9.28.4).As  a  result,  Mykenai  is  recorded on  the  Serpent  Column  in  Delphi  (ML  27.7)  and  in  Olympia (Paus. 5.23.2:      ).  During  this period  Mykenai  may  have  been  in  charge  of  the  Argive Heraion  (Kritzas  ( 1992)  232).  In  c. 460,  taking  advantage  of the  weakness  of  Sparta  after  the  earthquake  in  464,  the Argives  and  their  allies  besieged  the  Mykenaians,  who  found refuge  behind  their  Cyclopean  walls  (Diod. 11.65.3;  Paus. 7.25.5\u00ad6).  Mykenai  was  starved  into  surrender  and  exposed to an  andrapodismos  (Diod. 11.65.5)  whereby  the  surviving Mykenaians  were  transferred,  some  to  Kleonai  (no. 351),  some  to  Keryneia  (no. 236),  and  some  to Makedonia (Paus. 7.25.6).  The  city  itself  was  demolished  and  its  territo- ry  divided  among  Argos,  Kleonai  and  Tenea  (Diod. 11.65.2\u00ad5;  Paus. 2.16.5,  5.23.3,  8.27.1;Strabo 8.6.19,where is  a  convincing  emendation  of  MS  ; cf.  Pi\u00e9rart  ( 1992)  377\u00ad82).  The  walls  were  probably  disman- tled  on  this  occasion  (Boethius  ( 1921\u00ad23)  415). 354.Orneai  (Orneates) Map  58.  Lat. 37.45,long.  22.35.

Mor. 401D, quoting  a  dedication  of  C 4l),  in  Ionic  '  (Hdt. 8.73.3).  The  collective  and  external  use  is  the  only  one  attest- ed  in  the  sources  (e.g.  Hdt. 8.73.3;  Thuc. 5.67.2).  The  only source  in  which  Orneai  is  called  a  polis  (in  the  urban  sense) is  Diod. 16.34.3  (r 353/2)  and  39.4  (r 352/1:   '    ).Paus.8.27.1  (rC 5)  calls  Orneai  a  polisma,but, referring  to  his  own  time,  Strabo  classifies Orneai as a kome ( 8.6.17;  cf.  Steph.  Byz. 496.1).  If  Diodorus'  classification of Orneai  as  a  polis  can  be  trusted,  it  must  have  been  a  depend- ent  polis  lying  in  Argive territory.  Orneai's  status  as  an  ally  of Argos  (no. 347)  (Thuc. 5.67.2)  as  well  as  the  use  of  the  collec- tive  city-ethnic  in  a  C 4l  communal  dedication  set  up  in Delphi  (Jacquemin  ( 1999)  no. 381,see infra)  support  the information  obtained  from  Diodorus  that  Orneai  was  still  a political  community  and  not  just  an  Argive  municipality. Pausanias  ( 8.27.1)  cites  the  Argive  synoecism  of  Tiryns (no. 356),  Hysiai,  Orneai  (no. 354),  Mykenai  (no. 353)  and Mideia  as  a  model  for  the  synoecism  of  Megalopolis  (no. 282)  decided  in  371/70  and  carried  out  in  368.  The  Argive subjection  of  the  other  cities  in  Argolis,  however,  was  a  pro- tracted  process,  not  a  proper  synoecism,  and  Pausanias' information  about  Orneai  is  in  conflict w ith  other  sources testifying  to  the  polis  status  of  Orneai  in  C 4  (Demand  ( 1990) 59\u00ad60;  Pi\u00e9rart  ( 1997)  334\u00ad38). After  the  battle  of  Mantinea  in  418,  Orneai  and  Kleonai (no. 351)  are  described  by  Thucydides  as  being  allies  of  Argos (Thuc. 5.67.2,  72.4,  74.3).  In  416/15  a  Lakedaimonian  army invaded  the  territory  of  Argos.  The  Lakedaimonians  con- quered  Orneai,  fortified the place,  settled  it  with  exiled Argives,  and  left  a  garrison  when  they  withdrew.  But  assist- ed  by  an  Athenian  expeditionary  force,  the  Argive  army attacked  Orneai,  chased  the  settlers  away  and  demolished their  settlement  (Thuc. 6.7.1\u00ad2;Diod.  12.81.4\u00ad5).  According to  Paus. 2.25.6,  the  inhabitants  were transferred  to Argos (Moggi,  Sin. 210\u00ad13).  Subsequently,  Orneai  was  resettled, and  in  353/2  the  Lakedaimonians  defeated  an  Argive  army  in a  battle  near  Orneai  and  conquered  the  town  after  a  short siege  (Diod. 16.34.3  and 39.4,  where  the  same  story  is  told once  again,  but  in  reverse  order:  at  39.4  the  conquest  of Orneai  precedes  the  battle).  According  to  Diod. 16.39.4,  the 612 pi\u00e9rart Lakedaimonians  attacked  Orneai  because  it  was  allied  with Megalopolis  (no. 282).In,probably,C4l  the  Orneatai  defeat- ed  a  Sikyonian  invasion  army  and  had  their  victory  com- memorated  by  a  communal  dedication  in  Delphi (Jacquemin  ( 1999)  no. 381;  Paus. 10.18.5;Plut.  Mor. 401D: '    ). Orneai  has  been  located  at  Palaiokastraki,  i.e.  modern Lirkia  (Paus. 2.25.5).  Remains  of  a  defence  circuit  in  polygo- nal  masonry  are  still  visible;  it  is  undated  but  perhaps  of  C 4s (Pritchett  ( 1980)  25\u00ad27;  Pikoulas  ( 1995)  267\u00ad70). 355. ", "Hermion": "Identifier: 351. , was  a  Dryopian  community  (Hdt. 8.43,  78.2).  It was  a  member  of  the  Kalaurian  amphictyony  (Strabo  8.6.14; Tausend  ( 1992)  12\u00ad19)  and  of  the  Peloponnesian  League (Thuc. 8.3.2).  It  fought  on  the  Greek  side  in  the  Persian  War (Hdt. 8.43,  72,  9.28.4,  31.4),  and  is  recorded  on  the  Serpent Column  in  Delphi  (ML  27.5)  and  in  Olympia  (Paus. 5.23.2). The  importance  of  the  cities  on  Akte  for  Athenian  maritime interests  resulted  in  an  alliance  between  Hermion  and Athens  (no. 361),  concluded  either  c. 450  (IG i\u00b3 31  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 150)  or  c. 425  (Mattingly  ( 1996)  34\u00ad35).  In 435  Hermion  supported  Corinth  (no. 227)  against  Korkyra (no. 123)  with  one  trireme  (Thuc. 1.27.2).  During  the Peloponnesian  War  the  territory of  Hermion  was  plundered by  the  Athenians  (Thuc. 2.56.5).After  the  Athenian  defeat  at Syracuse,  Hermion  took  an  active  part  in  the  mobilisation  of a  Peloponnesian  fleet ( Thuc. 8.3.2),  and  after  the  battle  of Aigos  potamoi  in  405,  a  statue  was  set  up  in  Delphi  of  the commander  of  the  squadron  from  Hermion  (Paus. 10.9.10). Hermion  fought  on  the  Spartan  side  in  the  battle  of  Nemea (Xen.  Hell. 4.2.16)  and  remained  loyal  to  Sparta  (no. 345) even  after  the  battle  of  Leuktra (Xen.  Hell. 6.2.3,  7.2.2). Hermion  may  have  been  among  the  poleis  won over by Epameinondas  in  369  (Diod 15.69.1;  cf.  Jameson  et al.( 1994) 80).  Alongside  Sparta  and  other  members  of  the Peloponnesian  League,  Hermion  concluded  an  alliance  with Athens  in  370/69  (Xen.  Hell. 7.2.2;  cf.  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 274). Hermion  joined  the  revolt  against  Makedonia  after  the death  of  Alexander  the  Great  (Diod. 18.11.2).  IG iv\u00b2.1 102B.ii.203  ( 400\u00ad350)  records  a  payment  to  a  ...  `\u00b5. We  have  no  information  about  the  political  institutions of  Hermion,  and  there  is  no  support  in  the  sources  for  the view  that  the  Aristotelian  collection  of  politeiai  included  a constitution  of  the  Hermionians  (pace  Arist. iii  p. 635, Gigon). In  Ps.-Skylax 51  Hermion  is  classified as a  \u00b5.  The  town  lay  on  the  Gulf  of  Hydra.  In  the  Archaic and  Classical  periods  it  was  situated  at  the  tip  of  a  headland between  two  well-protected  natural  harbours,  but  later,  per- haps  in  C 2  or  C 1,  it  was  moved  c. 1  km  westwards  to  the  far end  of  the  peninsula  and  to the  lower  slopes  of  Mt.  Pron (Paus. 2.34.9;  Jameson  et al.( 1994)  584\u00ad90).  The  older  town was  fortified w ith  a  defence  circuit  in  trapezoidal  masonry. Some  stretches  of  the  wall  and  the  remains  of  a  round  tower can  still  be  seen.  The  wall  has  tentatively  been  dated  to  C 4, perhaps  C 4l  (Jameson  et al.( 1994)  585\u00ad86).  The  walls enclosed  an  area  of 22.5  ha,  of  which  some  8.5  ha  were  avail- able  for  habitation  in  C 6,  and  almost  17  ha  in  C 4.  Assuming a  population  density  of 250  per  ha,  the  town  may  in  C 4m have  had  some  4,200  inhabitants  (ibid. 551).  Paus. 2.34.10 records  seven  sanctuaries  in  the  old  town;  that  of  Poseidon has  been  matched  with  the  foundations  of  a  temple  of  C 6l (ibid. 589\u00ad90).  The  most  famous  cult  was  that  of  Demeter Chthonia,  for  whom  Lasos  of  Hermion  composed  a  dithyra- mb  (fr. 702,  PMG  (C 6s);  Paus. 2.35.5\u00ad8;Ael.  NA 11.4). Hermion  struck  coins  of  silver  and  bronze  from  c. 350.(1) Silver  triobols  and  obols  on  the  Aiginetan  standard;  types: obv.  head  of  Demeter  Chthonia  wearing  corn-wreath;  rev. corn-wreath  and,  sometimes,  torch(es);  legend: .(2) Bronze:  obv.  head  of  Demeter  Chthonia,  sometimes  facing; rev.  torch and  within corn-wreath (Head,HN\u00b2442;SNG Cop.  Argolis 136\u00ad44).  The  full  form  of  the  city-ethnic, ,  is  attested  on  coins  of  the  Roman  period (SNG  Cop.  Argolis 145). 351. ", "Tiryns": "Identifier: 52 , (Tirynthios)  Map  58.

The  city-ethnic  is (ML 27.6  ( 479);  Hdt. 9.28.4,  31.3);  these  examples testify  to  the  collective  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic.  For the  external  and  individual  use,  see  P  Oxy. 222.i.42  (r 468). Apart  from  Pind.  Ol. 10.68,where  Tiryns  is  called  a  polis  in a  mythological  context,  Tiryns  is  classified as a polis  in  late sources  only  (Mosch.  Megara 38;  Paus. 2.25.8;  Steph.  Byz. 625.17);  asty  is  found  at  Bacchyl. 10.57,  Maehler,  but  again  in a  mythological  context.  Polis  status  in  the  Archaic  and  early 614 pi\u00e9rart Classical  periods,  however,  is  strongly  indicated  by  the sacred  laws  of  c. 600  (SEG 30  380;see infra)  and  by  Tiryns' participation  in  the  Persian  War  on  a  par  with  communities which  were all  poleis  (ML 27.6).In  the  Archaic  period  Tiryns was  probably  a  polis  dependent  on  Argos  (no. 347)  (Pi\u00e9rart ( 1997)  335\u00ad36).  After  the  battle  of  Sepeia,  however,  Tiryns was  freed  from  Argive  supremacy  and,  together  with Mykenai  (no. 353),  it  provided  400  men  at  Plataiai  in  479 (Hdt. 9.28.4)  and  is  recorded  on  the  Serpent  Column  in Delphi  (ML  27.6)  and  in  Olympia  (Paus. 5.23.2:      ).  In  Olympia  in  468  a Tirynthian  was  the  winning  pugilist  in  the  boys'  category (Olympionikai 244;  P  Oxy. 222.i.42).  Shortly  afterwards Tiryns  was  taken  over  by  Argive  slaves  (douloi;  cf.  supra 605) expelled  from  Argos  by  the  sons  of  those  who  fell  at  Sepeia; after  some  years  of  peaceful  relations,  war  broke  out between  Argos  and  the  former  slaves  in  Tiryns,  who  eventu- ally  were  defeated  by  the  Argives  (Hdt. 6.83.1\u00ad2).They  found refuge  in  Epidauros  (no. 348)  and  Hermion  (no. 350),  and settled  Halieis  (no. 349)  (Hdt. 7.137.2;Strabo 8.6.11).Some  of the  inhabitants  may  have  been  incorporated  into  the  popu- lation  of  Argos  (no. 347)  (Paus. 8.27.1).  Tiryns  was  dem- olished,  and  part  of  the  booty  won  by  the  Argives  on  this occasion  could  still  be  seen  by  Pausanias  in  the  Argive Heraion  and  in  the  temple  of  Apollo  Lykeios  ( 2.17.5,  8.46.3). The  sacred  laws  of  c. 600,  inscribed  in  \"serpentine\"  style, are  the  oldest  known  documents  in  which  haliaia  and  demos are  juxtaposed  (SEG 30  380,  1\u00ad4,  8\u00ad9: ,  \u00b5);  and magistrates  mentioned  repeatedly  in  the  laws  are  the hieromnamones and  the  plativoinarchos (SEG 30 380  Nomima i78: \u00b5\u00b5,  ). In  Pausanias'  day only  ruins  were left  of  Tiryns,  but  the acropolis,  called  Likymna,  with  its  Cyclopean  walls  was  still impressive (Paus. 2.25.8,  9.36.5).  The  Archaic  temple  on  the top  of  the  acropolis  has  been  attributed  sometimes  to  Hera (Frickenhaus  ( 1912)),  sometimes  to  Athena  (Foley  ( 1988) 145\u00ad47).  An  Archaic  sanctuary  of  Herakles  is  attested  in  the serpentine  inscriptions  (SEG 30  380  n. 15).  Further  C 6  archi- tectural  spolia  from  the  acropolis  include  the  probable remains  of  a  propylon  or  stoa  (Schwandner  ( 1988)). So  far  no  remains  of  an  Archaic  settlement  have  been found  on  the  plain  below  the  acropolis.  Evidence  of  a  sub- stantial  post-Mycenaean  settlement  on  the  \"Unterburg\"  is well  documented,  and  although  occasional  sections  of  post- Geometric  walls  have  been  found,  along  with  a  couple  of  C 7 graves  on  the  surrounding  plain,  the  location  of  the  related settlement(s)  has  yet  to  be  securely  established.  This  has tempted  some  historians  to  see  Tiryns  as  a  polis  without  an urban  centre  (Koerner  ( 1985)).  It  would,  however,  be  most unwise,  given  the  very  limited  extent  of  excavation  on  the surrounding  plain,  to  draw  negative  conclusions  about  an absence  of  related  settlement.  The  location  of  graves  and settlement  traces  throughout  the  Early  Iron  Age  (from LH iiiC  onwards)  suggests  that  the  inhabitants  of  Tiryns lived  in  settlements  clustered  on  the  plain  immediately  sur- rounding  the  acropolis  (Morgan  and  Coulton  ( 1997)  93). 357.Troizen  (Troizenios) Map  58.

The  Doric  form  of  the  city-ethnic  is (ML 27.5,  95h;  IG iv\u00b2.1  122.10  (C 4);  IG iv  748.6 (C 4f));  the  Ionic  form  is  (Hdt. 3.59.1;  Thuc. 1.27.2;Xen.

Troizen  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  (Dem.  Ep. 2.18; Ps.-Skylax 52),  in  the  political  sense  (Arist.  Pol. 1335a15,  20; Hyp. 5.32;  Michel 452.6  (C 4l))  and  in  the  territorial  sense (Hyp. 5.31).  In  the  C 4f  accounts  of  the  Delphic  naopoioi  the Troizenioi  are  recorded  as  contributors  (CID ii  4.i.9)  under the  heading   \u00b5    (CID ii  4.i.3\u00ad4), where polis  is  used  in  the  political  sense  (cf.  also  Diod. 12.78.2 (r 419/18)  and  IG iv  750.12  Bielman  ( 1994)  19  (C 3e)). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  a  citizenship  decree  of 369(?): \u00b5  (IG iv  748.6,  17\u00ad18  Syll. \u00b3162)  and  externally  on  the  Serpent Column  in  Delphi  (ML  27.5  ( 479))  and  in  Hdt. 3.59.1;  Thuc. 8.3.2;Xen.  Hell. 4.2.16.  The  individual  and  external  use  is attested  in  the  thank-offering  for  the  victory  at  Aigos  pota- moi  (   :ML  95; Paus. 10.9.10  (r 405/4)). The  name  of  the  territory  is  (Thuc. 5.45.2)  or    (Thuc. 2.65.5); is  found  at  IG iv  748.4. It covered 354  km \u00b2  and  included  the  west  coast  of  the  Saronic Gulf  from  Methana  (no. 352)  to  Cape  Skyllaion  (Jameson  et al.( 1994)  18).After  the  death  of  Alexander  the  Great,  Troizen lost  the  island  of  Kalauria  (no. 360),  which  then  became  an independent  polis. Troizen  provided  five t riremes  at  Salamis  in  480  (Hdt. argolis  615 8.43),  and  1,000  men  at  Plataiai  in  479  (Hdt. 9.28.4). Assuming  that  there  is  no  overlap  between  the  two  forces, Jameson  et al.( 1994)  556\u00ad59  estimate  the  military  strength  of Troizen  at  2,000  men,  and  the  total  population  at  c. 11,500 minimum  and  16,500  maximum.  During  the  grain  crisis  in 330\u00ad326  Troizen  received  6,000  medimnoi  from  Kyrene  (no. 1028)  (Tod  196.45).  IG iv\u00b2.1102B.ii.203  ( 400\u00ad350)  records  a payment  to  a  ...  . Troizen  presided  over  the  Kalaurian  amphiktyony (Strabo  8.6.14;  Tausend  ( 1992)  12\u00ad19)  and  was  a  member  of the  Peloponnesian  League  (Diod. 12.78.2  (r 420)).  It  fought on  the  Greek  side  in  the  Persian  War  (Hdt. 8.1.2,  43,  9.28.4, 102.3,105),and  is  recorded  on  the  Serpent  Column  in  Delphi (ML 27.5)  and  in  Olympia  (Paus. 5.23.2).  During  the  Persian occupation  of  Attika  the  Athenians'  wives  and  children found  refuge  in  Troizen  (Hdt. 8.41.1;Plut.  Them. 10.5;ML 23.8,a C 3  copy  found  in  Troizen  of  a  C 4m  text,  quoted  by Aischines  in  348  (Dem. 19.303)).  It  was  occupied  by  the Athenians  in  460/59,  but  these  had  to surrender  the  city again  in  the  peace  of 446/5  (Thuc. 1.115.1,  4.21.3).  In  435  the Troizenians  supported  Corinth  (no. 227)  against  Korkyra (no. 123)  with  two  triremes  (Thuc. 1.27.2).  In  425  the Athenians  occupied  and  fortified M ethana  (no. 352)  and used  it  as  a  base  for  raids  against  the  neighbouring  comm- munities.  After  the  Athenian  defeat  at  Syracuse,  Troizen took  an  active  part  in  the  mobilisation  of  a  Peloponnesian fleet ( Thuc. 8.3.2)  and  in  the  naval  operations  (ML  95  ( 405)). Troizen  fought  on  the  Spartan  side  in  the  battle  of  Nemea (Xen.  Hell. 4.2.16)  and  remained  loyal  to  the  Spartans  even after  the  battle  of  Leuktra (Xen.  Hell. 6.2.3,  7.2.2).  In  369(?) Epaminondas  ravaged  the  territory  of  Troizen  but  failed  to conquer  the  city  (Diod. 15.69.1).  Alongside  Sparta  and  other members  of  the  Peloponnesian  League,  Troizen  concluded an  alliance  with  Athens  in  370/69  (IG iv  748  ( 369);  IG ii\u00b2 1425.227,  230  ( 368/7);  Xen.  Hell. 7.2.2;  cf.  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 274). After  the  Greek  defeat  at  Chaironeia,  a  pro-Makedonian  fac- tion  came  to  control  Troizen  (Hyp. 5.31;Lycurg.  1.42;  cf. Whitehead  ( 2000)  340),  possibly  as  the  result  of  a  stasis, since  a  number  of  citizens  were  sent  into  exile  and  at  least some  of  them  obtained  citizen  rights  in  Athens  (Hyp. 3.31; Osborne  ( 1983)  T 72).  In  325  Demosthenes  found  refuge  in Troizen  (Dem.  Ep. 2.18\u00ad19;Plut.  Dem. 26.5),  and  after  the death  of  Alexander  the  Great  in  323,Troizen  joined  the  revolt against  Makedonia  (Diod. 18.11.2;  Paus. 1.23.3\u00ad5). The  Aristotelian  collection  of  politeiai  included  a  consti- tution  of  the  Troizenians  (Arist.  frr. 613\u00ad15).  The  only  pre- served  psephisma  of  the  Classical  period  is  a  citizenship decree  proposed  by  a  named  citizen  and  passed  by  the  boule and  the  demos  (IG iv  748  Syll. \u00b3162  ( 369?)),  apparently  in accordance  with  a  probouleumatic  procedure  (Rhodes, DGS 77\u00ad78).  Another  citizenship  decree  is  referred  to  at Hyp. 5.31.  A decree  of  C 4l  or  C 3e  records  the  name  of  the proposer  and  of  the  prostates  of  the  boule,  and  refers  to a board  of  damiourgoi  (Wilhelm  ( 1974)  i. 38).A  C 4  dedication of  fourteen  named  damiourgoi  and  prytaneis  ( \u00b5  ) is consecrated to    ,i.e.Phaedra (IG iv  764).  Public  enactments  were  set  up  in  the  sanctuary of  Apollo  Thearios  (IG iv  748.15\u00ad16). The  citizens  were  organised  into  phylai  (IG iv  748),  of which  there  were  at  least  three  and  presumably  four.  Of  the three  Dorian  tribes,  the  Hylleis  are  attested  (IG iv  750.8 (C 3e));  the  existence  of  the  Dymanes  is  indicated  at  Steph. Byz. 74.8,  and  it  is  then  a  fair  guess  that  the  Pamphyloi  were to  be  found  in  Troizen  too.  The  Scheliadai  ( :  IG iv  748.24)  constituted  another  phyle,  which,  pace  Jones, POAG 111,  cannot  have  contained  all  the  non-Dorian  cit- izens,  since  sortition  conducted  by  a  magistrate  called was  used  when  a  naturalised  citizen  was  assigned to a phyle  (IG iv  748.20\u00ad22).  In  c. 390  exiles  from  Siphnos (no. 519)  found  refuge  in  Troizen  (Isoc. 19.23).  Two Troizenians  are  attested  as  Athenian  metics  in  C 4s  (IG ii\u00b2 1673  SEG 34  122.57\u00ad58).  In  C 4l  a  citizen  of  Troizen  was appointed  proxenos  by Megara (no. 225)  (IG vii  7;  cf. Rhodes,  DGS 111). Baukis  of  Troizen  is  attested  as  victor  in  the  Olympic Games  in  400  (Olympionikai 358),and  in  C 6s  Damotimos  of Troizen  won  a  race  in  Thebes  (IG iv  801  LSAG 181.2). The  calendar  was  of  the  Doric  type,  to  judge  from  the months  attested  in  Troizen:  viz.  Geraistios  (Ath. 639C;  cf. Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 199),  Artemitios  (IG iv  840.9  (C 3))  and Apellaios  (Wilhelm  ( 1908)  73  (C 3?)). The  urban  centre  was  situated  below  Mt.  Aderes  and dominated  a  coastal  plain  c. 2  km  wide  along  the  Gulf  of Poros.  The  town  had  an  acropolis  with  a  sanctuary  of Athena  Sthenias  (Paus. 2.32.5).In  C 6m  a  temple  was  built  on the  slopes  of  the  acropolis  (Jameson  et al.( 1994)  72),  which Welter  ( 1941)  20  tentatively  identified as that of  Aphrodite Akraia  (Paus. 2.32.6).  The  agora  was  situated  in  the  upper part  of  the  habitation  area,  and  the  temple  of  Apollo Thearios  in  the  agora  was  the  oldest  of  all  temples  known  to Paus. 2.31.6.A prytaneion  is  attested  in  a  decree  of  C 4l/C3e (Wilhelm  ( 1974)  i. 38).  An  extra-urban  complex  with  a  sta- dion,  associated  with  Asklepios  and  Hippolytos,  dates  from C 4l  or  C 3e  (Welter  ( 1941)  35\u00ad38;  Jameson  et al.( 1994)  83). Troizen  was  apparently  fortified in  369  (Diod. 15.69.1)  but the  sparse  remains  of  a  defence  circuit  in  polygonal  mason- 616 pi\u00e9rart ry  are  tentatively  dated  to  C 3e  (Welter  ( 1941)  12),  a  date which,  according  to  Maier  ( 1959)  no. 32,  is  pure  guesswork.

The city-ethnic  is,  in  the  plural  form, (Xen.  Hell. 4.2.16), from  * which,  however,  is  unattested  (Steph.  Byz. 73.12);  instead  we  find the ktetikon (IG iv\u00b2.1  122.69 (C 4)),  which  is  attested  in  the  plural  form  as  well  (Bacchyl. fr. 4.49;  IG iv\u00b2.1  122.80:[ ]     ).Halieis is called  a  polis  implicitly  in  the  urban  sense  (Ps.-Skylax  50;  cf. Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  142)  and  explicitly  in  the political  sense  (IG iv\u00b2.1  122.74,  80  (C 4)).  The  external  use  of the  city-ethnic  is  attested  both  collectively  (IG i\u00b3  75.6\u00ad7,  19, 27  ( 424/3);  IG iv\u00b2.1  122.80  (C 4);  Xen.  Hell. 4.2.16,  7.2.2)  and individually  (IG iv\u00b2.1121.120  (C 4),122.69  (C 4)).The  internal collective use  of  the  city-ethnic  Tirynthioi  is  attested  on  C 5 coins  (infra). The  territory is  called     (Thuc. 2.56.5,4.45.2)  and its  area  is  estimated  at  84  km \u00b2  (Jameson  et al.( 1994)  18).  The earliest  community  was  probably  Dryopian  (Bacchyl.  fr 4.49;  Callim.  fr. 705,  Pfeiffer;  cf.  Jameson  et al.( 1994)  63\u00ad65). Remains  of  a  settlement  at  Halieis  can  be  traced  back  to  the Geometric  period.  The  town  flourished in the A rchaic  and Classical  periods  (Jameson  et al.( 1994)  435\u00ad37).  It  may  have been  a  polis  already  in  the  Archaic  period,  but  the  absence  of Halieis  from  the  victory  dedications  at  Olympia  and  Delphi (Paus. 5.23.1\u00ad2;ML  27)  indicates  that,  if  it  was  a  polis,  it  must have  been  a  dependent  polis,  dominated  by,  probably, Hermion  (no. 350)  as  may  be  inferred  from  Ephor.  fr. 56  (cf. Jameson  et al.( 1994)  75).  In  c. 460  Halieis  must  have  been ceded  by  Hermion  to  the  Tirynthians  (no. 356)  after  they had  been  expelled  from  Tiryns  by  the  Argives  (Hdt. 6.83.1\u00ad2; Strabo  8.6.11\u00ad12;  Paus. 2.25.8).  They  formed  a  community called        at  Hdt. 7.137.2,  though  608 pi\u00e9rart on  their  coins  they  used  their  original  city-ethnic:  (infra).  In  460/59  a  battle  between  the Athenians  and  the  Peloponnesians  was  fought  at  Halieis (Thuc. 1.105;  IG i\u00b3  1147.3);  the  territory  of  Halieis  was  repeat- edly  ravaged  by  the  Athenians  during  the  Peloponnesian War  (Thuc. 2.56.5,  4.45.2  (r 425)),  and  in  425/4  the  Halieis concluded  an  alliance  with  the  Athenians  in  which  they handed  over  a  fortified port for the duration of  the  war  (IG i\u00b3  75  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 184).  Halieis  was  a  member  of  the Peloponnesian  League  (Diod. 11.78.2;Xen.  Hell. 4.2.16)  until after  the  battle  of  Leuktra  in  371.  Halieis  may  have  been among  the  poleis  won  over  by  Epameinondas  in  369  (Diod 15.69.1;  cf.  Jameson  et al.( 1994)  80). The  only  known  source  for  the  constitution  of  Halieis  is  a bronze  plaque  inscribed  in  the  Argive  alphabet  with  a  public enactment  of  C 5f,  allegedly  found  at  Hermion  but  now commonly  assigned  to  Halieis  (IG iv  554  SEG 11 315  Nomima i107;  cf.  Jameson  ( 1974)  68\u00ad69;  contra  Brandt ( 1992)).  A  tentative  date  of  c. 480,  suggested  at  LSAG 169  no. 20,  is  probably  too  high.  The  document  concerns  the  calling to  account  of  officials in c harge  of  the  treasures  of  Athena and  mentions  an  assembly  (haliaia),  a  boule,  and  some  mag- istrates  (synartyontes  and  tamiai). The  natural  harbour  of  Halieis  (limen  at  Ps.-Skylax  50) was  one  of  the  best  along  the  coast;  the  sea-ward  approach stretched  for  1,300  m  and  narrowed  to  less  than  300  m.  The town,  today  partly  submerged,  was  situated  on  a  small promontory  dominating  the  southern  bay  of  Porto-Cheli.  A defence  circuit  connected  the  town  with  an  acropolis  on which  there  was  a  modest  temple,  perhaps  to  Athena (Jameson  ( 1974)  73\u00ad74).  Halieis  was  fortified in C 5  (cf.  IG i\u00b3 75.11  ( 425/4));  the  circuit  was  of  mudbrick  on  conglomerate foundations  with  interval  towers;  fortification on the site can  be  traced  back  to  at  least  C 7  (Jameson  et al.( 1994)  435); Lang  ( 1996)  176  with  refs.).  The  walls  enclosed  an  area  of 18 ha,  of  which  some  15  ha  were suitable  for  habitation  in  C 4m. Assuming  a  population  density  of 250  per  ha,  the  town  may in  C 4m  have  had  some  3,750  inhabitants  (Jameson  et al. ( 1994)  551).The  north-eastern  quarter  of  the  lower  town  was built  on  a  grid  plan  from  C 6f  (Rudolph  ( 1984)).  Outside  the walls  were  found  remains  of  a  Classical  stadion  (Romano ( 1993)  36),a  stoa  and  a  C 7e  temple  to  Apollo  (Jameson  ( 1974) 71\u00ad72).  In  C 4,  after  the  miraculous  cure  of  a  citizen  by  a snake  from  the  Asklepieion  in  Epidauros,  the  polis  of  Halieis consulted  the  Delphic  oracle  and  was  instructed  to  build  a temple  with  a  statue  of  Asklepios  (IG iv\u00b2.1  122.69\u00ad82;  cf. Edelstein  and  Edelstein  ( 1945)  423.33).  Excavations  show that  the  town  was  abandoned  in  C 3e  at  the  latest  (Jameson  et al.( 1994)  436\u00ad37),but  an  inscription  still  uses  the  city-ethnic in  Epidauros  in  220/19  (IG iv\u00b2.142.10\u00ad11). Fishermen  may  have  used  the  site  sporadically,  as  they  had when  the  Tirynthians  settled  in  Halieis  in  C 5f  (Baladi\u00e9 ( 1980)  267). Halieis  struck  bronze  coins  in  C 4.

App. 4.45  (C 3);  Strabo  8.6.3;  Paus. 2.32.7;  but  see  also  IG iv  619.5  (late?)).  The  city-ethnic  is `\u00b5  (IG iv  683  Hesperia 22  ( 1953)  148\u00ad54  no. 1  LSAG 182.8  (C 5m);  IG i\u00b3  31.2  (C 5m)).  Hermion  is  called  a polis  in  the  urban  sense  (Ps.-Skylax  51)  and  is  repeatedly  list- ed  under  the  heading  of  polis  used  in  the  political  sense (Hdt. 8.42.1,  43.1,  49.l;  Thuc. 8.3.2).  The  collective use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  abbreviated  form  on coins  from  C 4m  on  (infra)  and  externally  in  inscriptions (ML 27.5  ( 479);  Syll. \u00b332  LSAG 182.7  (C 5f);  IG i\u00b3  31.2  (C 5)) and  in  literature  (Hdt. 9.28.4;  Thuc. 1.27.2;Xen.  Hell. 4.2.16). The  individual  use  is  found  internally  in  dedications  to Demeter  Chthonia  (Hesperia 22  ( 1953)  148\u00ad54  nos. 1\u00ad4 (C 5\u00adC4))  and  externally  in  inscriptions  (CID ii  5.i.12  (C 4f)) and  in  literature  (Hdt. 7.6.3  (rC 6m)). The  name  of  the  territory  is  `\u00b5   (Thuc. 2.56.5).  It comprised  the  south-eastern  part  of  Akte. Hermion  bordered  on  Troizen  (no. 357)  to  the  north-east, on  Epidauros  (no. 348)  to  the  north-west,  and  on  Halieis (no. 349)  to  the  south-west  (Thuc. 2.56.5).The  territory  cov- ered  276  km \u00b2  (Jameson  et al.( 1994)  18).It  also  comprised  the islands  of  Pityoussa  (Spetses),  Aristera  (Spetsopoula), Aperopia  (Dokos)  and  Hydrea  (Hydra)  (Paus. 2.34.8\u00ad9).  In C 6s  a  group  of  Samian  refugees  bought  the  island  of  Hydra from  Hermion  for  some  money  they  had  exacted  from  the Siphnians,  whereupon  they  handed  over  the  island  in  trust to  the  Troizenians  (Hdt. 3.59.1).  Prior  to c. 460,  when  the Tirynthians  settled  at  Halieis,  that  site  may  have  been  con- trolled  by Hermion  (Ephor.  fr. 56;  Jameson  et al.( 1994)  75). Hermion  provided  three  triremes  at  Salamis  in  480  (Hdt. 8.43)  and  300  men  at  Plataiai  in  479  (Hdt. 9.28.4).Assuming that  there  is  no  overlap  between  the  two  forces,  Jameson  et argolis  609 al.( 1994)  556\u00ad59  estimate  the  military  strength  of  Hermion at 900  men,  and  the  total  population  at  c. 5,000  minimum and 7,500  maximum.  During  the  grain  crisis  in  330\u00ad326 Hermion  received  8,000  medimnoi  from  Kyrene  (no. 1028) (Tod 196.40).  A  communal  dedication  at  Delphi  is  attested by Syll. \u00b332  (C 5f);  cf.  Jacquemin  ( 1999)  no. 314.", "Kleonai": "Identifier: 352. , (Kleonaios) Map  58.  Lat. 37.50,long.  22.45.

Nem. 10.42).  Kleonai  is  attested  as  a polis  in  late  sources  only  (Polyb. 2.52.1,  2;  Paus. 2.15.1),  but  its status  as  a  polis  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  is ensured  by  its  mint,  its  control  of  the  Nemean  Games,  its Panhellenic  victors,  and  the  proxeny  decrees  for  Kleonaian citizens  (infra).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attest- ed  internally  in  abbreviated  form  on  C 5\u00adC4  coins  (infra) and  externally  on  a  C 6f  bronze  plate  from  Olympia  (SEG 31 365)  and  in  literary  sources  (Pind.  Nem. 10.42;  Thuc. 5.67.2). The  individual  use  is  attested  internally  in  a  C 6m  dedication (SEG 11  290.6)  and  externally  in  two  Athenian  C 4  proxeny decrees  for  citizens  of  Kleonai  (IG ii\u00b2  63  and 365  (on  which latter,  see  infra)). Kleonai  was  squeezed  in  between  Corinth  (no. 227)  and Argos  (no. 347)  (Paus. 2.15.1\u00ad2;Strabo 8.6.19).  Its  territory covered some 135  km \u00b2,  and  its  total  population  has  been assessed  at  c. 8,000  persons  (Sakellariou  and  Faraklas  ( 1971) 122,  125,  128).  Hostile  relations  with  Corinth  (Plut.  Cim. 17.1\u00ad2)  made  Kleonai  an  ally  of  Argos,  and  the  Kleonaians assisted  the  Argives  when,  in  the  460s,  they  conquered  and destroyed  Mykenai  (no. 353)  (Strabo  8.6.19;  cf.  Diod. 11.65). 610 pi\u00e9rart Some  of  the  surviving  Mykenaians  settled  in  Kleonai  (Paus. 7.25.6).  During  the  Peloponnesian  War  Kleonai  was  still allied  to  Argos  (Thuc. 5.67.2,  72.4,  74.3).  A  citizen  of  Kleonai was  appointed  proxenos  by Athens  prior  to 378/7  (IG ii\u00b2  63). If  the  restoration  [ ] in  an  Athenian  proxeny decree  of 323/2  (IG ii\u00b2  365;  cf.  Pi\u00e9rart  and  Touchais  ( 1996) 62\u00ad64)  is  accepted,  the  inference  is  that  Kleonai  was  still  a polis  in  C 4l  (Pi\u00e9rart  ( 1982)  129)  and  that  is  further  confirmed by  the  bronze  coins  struck  by  Kleonai  in  C 4l  (infra).  But  at some  point  in  C 4l  Kleonai  was  incorporated  into  Argos  and became  a  civic  subdivision  of  that  polis  (SEG 30  355  (C 4l);  IG iv  616  (c. 315)).  Remains  of  a  polygonal  acropolis  fortifica- tion  with  interval  towers  and  a  defence  circuit  of  the  lower town  (Scheer  ( 1989)  332)  may  antedate  the  incorporation  of Kleonai  into  Argos. The  biennial  Panhellenic  games  held  in  the  sanctuary  of Zeus  in  Nemea  (on  which  see  Hart  ( 1977))  were controlled by  Kleonai  in  C 5f  (Pind.  Nem. 4.17,10.42);  they  had  probably been  organised  by  Kleonai  from  their  foundation  in  573 (Euseb. 101b,  Helm)  and  continued  to  be  so  until  Kleonai was  integrated  into  Argos  in  C 4l.  Citizens  of  Kleonai  were victors  in  the  Olympic  Games  in  732  and 456  (Olympionikai 12  and 273)  and  in  the  Nemean  Games  in  C 6m  (SEG 11 290  ML 9). Paus. 2.15.1  records  a  sanctuary  of  Athena,  apparently  of the  Archaic  period.  A  sanctuary  of  Herakles  is  mentioned  at Diod. 4.33.3.  Remains  found  at  Archaia  Nemea  have  been tentatively  identified w ith  this  sanctuary  by  Frickenhaus (Karo ( 1913)  114). The  sanctuary  of  Zeus  in  the  valley  of  Nemea  was  exca- vated  by  S.  Miller  ( 1990),and  in  it  was  found  a  C 4l  list  of  the- orodokoi  for  the  Nemean  Games,  presumably  drawn  up  by Argos  when  it  took  over  control  of  the  games  c. 315  (Perlman ( 2000)  105\u00ad55). Kleonai  struck  coins  of  silver  on  the  Aiginetan  standard c. 471\u00ad421  and  of  bronze  in  C 4l.  ( 1)  Silver  (C 5);  types:  obv. head  of  Herakles  (obol),  or  lion's  skin  (hemiobol),  or  bunch of  grapes  (tetartemorion);  rev.  incuse  square;  legend: .(2) Bronze (C 4l);  types:  obv.  head  of  Herakles;  rev.  parsley wreath;  legend: or or (Babelon,  Trait\u00e9 ii. 3.  481\u00ad84;  SNG  Cop.

It covered c. 135 km \u00b2  of  fertile  plain  (Meyer  ( 1941)  272)  along  the  upper  reach of  the  river  Asopos.  The  valley  is  ringed  by  mountains  and  it bordered  to the  south  on  Argos  (no. 347)  and  Orneai  (no. 354)  (Xen.

At  Hell. 5.3.16  Xenophon  quotes  the  Lakedaimonians  for  the statement  that  Phleious  had  5,000  adult  male  citizens,  prob- ably  an  exaggerated  figure ( a  total  population  of 20,000 minimum,  with  150  persons  per  km \u00b2!)  and  hardly  compati- ble  with  Prokles  of  Phleious'  concession  that  Phleious  was one  of  the  small  poleis  (Xen.  Hell. 6.5.44).On  the  other  hand, if  Xenophon  is  right  that  more  than  1,000  pro-Spartan Phleiasians  were  in  exile  in  381  (Hell. 5.3.17),  Phleious  must have  been  among  the  most  populous  Peloponnesian  poleis. Phleious  fought  on  the  Greek  side  in  the  Persian  War (Hdt. 7.202,  8.72,  9.28.4),  and  is  recorded  on  the  Serpent Column  in  Delphi  (ML  27.5)  and  in  Olympia  (Paus. 5.23.2). It  was  a  member  of  the  Peloponnesian  League  (Thuc. 7.57.2; Xen.  Hell. 5.2.8).  Having  Argos  (no. 347)  as  its  arch-enemy and  being  involved  in  numerous  wars  with  the  Argives, Phleious  usually  sided  with  Sparta  (no. 345)  and  the  mem- bers  of  the  Peloponnesian  League.  Thus,  in  435  the Phleiasians  supported  Corinth  (no. 227)  against  Korkyra (no. 127)  (Thuc. 1.27.2);  400  men  joined  Brasidas  in  424 (Thuc. 4.70.1);  and  in  418,  when  Agis  attacked  Argos,  the invasion  army  rallied  at  Phleious  (Thuc. 5.57).  After  the  oli- garchic  coup  d'\u00e9tat  in  Argos  in  417,  Phleious  sheltered  the exiled  Argives  (Thuc. 5.83.3)  and  was  subsequently  exposed to  several  Argive  incursions  into  its  territory  (Thuc. 5.83.3, 115.1,  6.105.3).  At  the  beginning  of  the  Corinthian  War Phleious  remained  neutral  (Xen.  Hell. 4.2.16),but  numerous raids  by  Iphikrates'  mercenaries  forced  the  Phleiasians  to ask  for  and  admit  a  Spartan  garrison  (Xen.  Hell. 4.4.15, 5.3.15).  The  government  imposed  by  the  Spartans  (infra) remained  loyal  to  Sparta  after  Leuktra  (Xen.  Hell. 7.2.2). Together  with  Sparta  the  Phleiasians  approached  the Athenians  in  369  (Xen.  Hell. 7.1.1;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 274),  and  in 362/1  they  concluded  an  alliance  with  the  Athenians  (IG ii\u00b2 112;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 290).  Phleious  joined  the  Greek  revolt against  Makedonia  after  the  death  of  Alexander  the  Great (Paus. 1.25.4). Phleiasian  citizens  received  grants  of  proxeny  from Athens  (no. 361)  (IG i\u00b3  80.14\u00ad16  ( 421/20))  and  from Epidauros  (no. 348)  (SEG 11  400  ( 375\u00ad350)).  Phleious  grant- ed  proxeny  to a  citizen  of  Pellene  (no. 240)  and  released  him without  ransom  when  he  was  taken  prisoner  (Xen.  Hell. 7.2.16).  The  Phleiasians  sheltered  the  Argive  priestess  of Hera  who  fled A rgos  after  having  set  the  temple  on  fire (Thuc. 4.133.3). Information  about  diplomatic  activities  is  sparse,  but  we hear  about  Phleiasian  envoys  to  Sparta  (Xen.  Hell. 5.3.14,  24) and  Athens  (Xen.  Hell. 7.1.1).  Several  Phleiasians  served  as naopoioi  in  Delphi  (CID ii  74.77  ( 337/6),  75.ii.50  ( 336/5)).  In 498  Timainetos  of  Phleious  won  the  hoplite  race  in  Nemea (Paus. 10.7.7),  and  another  Nemean  victor  is  celebrated  by Bacchyl. 9,  Maehler. The  only  information  we  have  about  the  constitution  of argolis  613 Phleious  in  the  Archaic  period  is  the  tradition  that  in  C 6  the city  was  ruled  by  a  tyrant  called  Leon,  allegedly  a  friend  of Pythagoras  (Diog.  Laert. 1.12,  8.8).  There  is  no  foundation for  Gigon's  view  that  the  Aristotelian  collection  of  politeiai included  a  constitution  of  Phleious  (Arist.  no. 142).  In  C 4e Phleious  seems  to  have  been  a  democracy  with  ekklesiai attended  by  all  citizens  (Xen.  Hell. 5.3.16;  cf. \u00b5  at 5.3.21).In  395  some  pro-Spartan  citizens  were  exiled  and  had their  property confiscated (Xen.  Hell. 4.4.15,  5.2.10).  With Spartan  support  they  were  repatriated  in  384  (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.9),  but  in  381  they  appealed  to  Sparta  once  again  because they  could  not  recover  the  property  confiscated in  395.A Lakedaimonian  army  under  Agesilaos  invaded  Phleious  and laid  siege  to  the  city  assisted  by  more  than  1,000  exiled Phleiasians  whom  he  had  trained  and  organised  into  syssitia (Xen.  Hell. 5.3.10\u00ad17).  The  Phleiasians  endured  a  siege  of 20 months  but  were starved  into  surrender  in  379.  The  judicial purge  after  the  conquest  was  carried  out  by  a  commission  of 100  men  ( 50  of  the  exiles  and  50  of  the  besieged);  Agesilaos imposed  a  new  constitution,  presumably  an  oligarchy,  and left  a  garrison  in  Phleious  (Xen.  Hell. 5.3.21\u00ad25;Isoc.  4.126; Diod. 15.19.3;  cf.  Gehrke,  Stasis 127\u00ad31).  A  number  of  the besieged  Phleiasians  went  into  exile  (Diod. 15.40.5;Xen. Hell. 7.2.5)  but  took  possession  of  two  strongholds  in Phleiasian  territory:  with  Sikyonian  support  they  held Thyamia,  and  with  Argive  support  they  held  Trikaranon (Xen.  Hell. 7.2.1,  7.4.1,  11),  from  where  they  attacked  Phleious in 374  (Diod. 15.40.5;  Roy ( 1973);  Stylianou  ( 1998)  330\u00ad31)  or perhaps  in  370  (Buckler  ( 1980)  292  n. 1).  In  367/6,  with  the support  of  an  army  from  Arkadia  and  Elis  (no. 251),  the exiles  organised  a  major  nocturnal  attack  on  Phleious, which  failed  (Xen.  Hell. 7.2.5\u00ad9),  as  did  later  attacks launched  first b y  the  Argives  and  the  Arkadians  and  later  by the  Sikyonians  (no. 228)  and  Pellenians  (no. 240)  (Xen.  Hell. 7.2.10\u00ad15). The  only  known  public  act  is  a  sacred  law,  perhaps  of  C 6f (IG iv  439  LSAG 150  n. 1).  A  decree  found  on  Delos  was attributed  to  Phleious  by  Robert  ( 1948)  5\u00ad15,  but  to Corinth (no. 227)  by  Jones  ( 1980). The  town  of  Phleious  lay  on  a  ridge  rising  to  c. 60  m  above the  plain.  On  the  top  of  the  ridge  was  a  citadel  called  akra (Xen.  Hell. 4.4.15)  or  akropolis  (Xen.  Hell. 5.3.15);  it  was  most- ly  uninhabited  and  used  for  growing  grain  (Xen.  Hell. 7.2.8). An  urban  survey  of  the  town  indicates  that  it  covered  an  area of  c. 60  ha  (Alcock  ( 1991)  428  fig. 3).  The  town  was  fortified with  a  defence  circuit,  c. 4  km  long,  probably  of  mudbrick  on a  stone  socle  in  ashlar  masonry  and  with  interval  towers. Some  stretches  of  the  stone  socle  can  still  be  seen  in  the foundations  of  the  \"Corinthian  Gate\"  (Xen.  Hell. 7.2.11)  in the  north-east  corner  of  the  wall.  The  acropolis  was  sepa- rately  fortified.  The  wall  has  tentatively  been  dated  to  C 4e (Xen.  Hell. 7.2.7\u00ad8;  Alcock  ( 1991)  435\u00ad37). An  agora  has  been  identified at the w estern  end  of  the acropolis  ridge  (Alcock  ( 1991)  432).  Of  the  monumental buildings  only  two  antedate  the  Hellenistic  period:  the \"Hypostyle  Hall\"  tentatively  dated  to  the  Archaic  period (Blegen  ( 1925)  30\u00ad31;  Biers  ( 1971)  445),  and  the  \"Palati\",  a  rectangular  \"basilica\"  (c. 34 26  m)  with  a  courtyard  surrounded  by columns  and  open  to the  sky,  probably  of C 5s.  It  may  have  had  rows  of  seats  arranged  to  look  out  on the  central  courtyard,  and  it  may  have  been  used  as  a  bouleu- terion  and/or  a  dikasterion  (Biers  ( 1971),  ( 1973)).  A \u00b5   of  c. 500  is  attested  in  literary  sources (Ath. 210B;  cf.  Roux  ( 1958)  161\u00ad70).  A  theatre  north  of  the Hypostyle  Hall  may  go  back  to  C 4  (TGR  ii. 117). The  principal  cult  was  that  of  Ganymede  (Hebe),  whose sanctuary  on  the  acropolis  is  known  exclusively  from  Paus. 2.13.3\u00ad4.  An  extra-urban  sanctuary  of  Hera  is  mentioned  by Xen.  Hell. 7.2.1,  6,  11\u00ad13. Phleious  may  have  struck  silver  staters  on  the  Euboic standard  in  C 6,  and  undoubtedly  struck  coins  of  silver  and bronze  on  the  Aiginetan  standard  from  c. 431  to c. 322.(1) Silver,  C 6;  types:  obv. between  the  legs  of  a  triskeles;  rev. incuse  square  divided  into  eight  triangles.

Methana  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  (Ps.- Skylax 46),  provided  that  M\u00fcller  ad  loc.  is  right  in  supposing that    \u00b5  is  misplaced  from  the Argolic  section  and  erroneously  listed  among  the Lakedaimonian  perioikic  poleis  (Shipley  ( 1997)  226). The  territory  of  Methana  was  the  volcanic  peninsula  on the  south  coast  of  the  Saronic  Gulf.  The  last  attested  erup- tion  of  the  volcano  was  in  C 3f  (Strabo  1.3.18;  Paus. 2.34.1;  cf. Baladi\u00e9  ( 1980)  158\u00ad63).  The  peninsula  is  separated  from  the continent  by  an  isthmus  1,200  m  long  and  300  m  wide.  It  was an  ideal  military  base,  and  in  425  the  Athenians  (no. 361) occupied  Methana  and  built  a  wall  across  the  isthmus (Thuc. 4.45.2).  The  Peace  of  Nikias  stipulated  the  restitution of  the  peninsula  to  the  Lakedaimonians  (no. 345)  (Thuc. 5.18.7). In C 5  and  probably  C 4  Methana  was  under  Troizenian domination  (Thuc. 4.118.4;  cf.  HCT  ad  loc.;  Paus. 2.34.1).The classification of  Methana  as  a  polis  in  Ps.-Skylax  (if  correctly interpreted  supra)  and  the  C 4  coins  (infra)  indicate  that Methana  was  a  dependent  polis  (Mee  and  Forbes  ( 1997) 68\u00ad69).In  the  Hellenistic  period  Methana  was  controlled  by the  Ptolemaic  kings  (Robert  ( 1960)  156\u00ad60)  and  renamed    (OGIS 102;  SNG  Cop.  Argolis 147). The  town  was  on  the  west  coast  of  the  peninsula;  it  cov- ered  an  area  of  c. 5  ha  in  the  Archaic  and  c. 8  ha  in  the  Classical period.  The  acropolis  was  protected  by  a  defence  circuit partly  in  trapezoidal  irregular  and  partly  in  isodomic  ashlar masonry  with  square  towers;  it  covered  an  area  of  c. 1  ha.  The probable  date  is  C 4s.Apart  from  the  urban  centre  there  were two  large  second-order  settlements  on  the  eastern  side  of  the peninsula,  one  at  Oga  (c. 6  ha)  and  one  at  Magoula  (c. 2  ha), neither  of  them  recorded  in  Barr.  Furthermore,  the  penin- sula  is  dotted  with  smaller  sites,  some  of  which  can  be  inter- preted  as  farmsteads  and  some  as  small  hamlets.  The number  of  sites  reached  its  peak  in  C 5l,  and  there  were  con- siderably  fewer  sites  in  C 4  (Mee  and  Forbes  ( 1997)  57\u00ad69). Methana  struck  bronze  coins  in  C 4l  and  C 3e:  obv.  head  of Hephaistos  in  conical  pilos;  rev. or in  corn- wreath  (Gill  ( 1997)  278\u00ad79;  SNG  Cop.  Argolis 146). 353.

Byz. 346.1,quoting  Polyb. 13.10.10).Variant  forms  are  attested  in  late  sources:  (Plin.  HN 4.41;  Steph.  Byz. 350.4;  Ptol. 2.11.7)  and,  perhaps, (Steph.  Byz. 154.8).  The  city-ethnic  is   (C 2  coins:  Head,  HN \u00b2278).  Kabyle  is  called  a  polis  in  late sources  only  (Strabo  7.6.2;  Steph.  Byz. 350.4)  and  is described  as  a  chorion  by  Harpokration,  quoting Theopompos  (fr. 220)  and  Anaximenes  (FGrHist 72  fr. 12). At Suda  (K 9)  it  is  referred  to as  a    .Kabyle was  apparently  a  military  colony  founded  or  perhaps refounded  by  Philip  II  (Dem. 8.44;Strabo 7.6.2;  Steph.  Byz. 350.4)  c. 340  (Theopomp.  fr. 220). Ancient  Kabyle  was  situated  on  a  plateau  overlooking  a bend  in  the  river  Tonzos  (modern  Tundja), 7  km  north  of the  modern  city  of  Yambol  (Velkov  ( 1982a)).  Excavated inscriptions  have  confirmed its location ( Velkov  ( 1991a)).In Antiquity,  the  river-bed  of  the  Tonzos  (modern  Tundja,  now occupied  by  a  tributary  of  the  Tonzos,  the  Azmak),  lay  some 3  or 4  km  nearer  Kabyle,  and  thus  washed  around  its  south- eastern  periphery.  The  excavators  assume  that  docking  facil- ities  would  have  existed  close  by.  The  nucleus  of  the  ancient settlement  was  the  acropolis  of  Zai  ci vruh,  where  an  Iron Age  cult  centre  was  located,  associated  in  Hellenistic  times with  Artemis  Phosphoros  and  Herakles  (Velkov  ( 1983) 237\u00ad38).Traces  of  occupation  in  the  early  Iron  Age  have  been discovered  on  the  lower  hill  to  the  south-east,  called  Hisarlik (Archibald  ( 1998)  45  with  further  refs.). Excavations  along  the  lower  slopes  of  Zai  ci vruh,  where the  C 4  western  gateway  and  contemporary  parts  of  the  adja- cent  circuit  wall  were  discovered  (Domaradzki  ( 1991)),  have shown  that  the  earliest  occupation  layer  in  this  area  dates from  the  same  period,  on  the  basis  of  imported  amphora stamps  of  C 4s  (Domaradzki  ( 1991)  59;Getov ( 1995)  99\u00ad101). Deep  trenches  in  the  Roman  city  have  revealed  evidence  of earlier  deposits.  None  of  this  material  has  yet  been  pub- lished,  although  brief  reports  have  appeared  in  the  annual bulletin  of  excavations  of  the  Institute  of  Archaeology,  Sofia (Archeologicheski  Otkritya  i  Razkopki AOR).  Between  1986 and 1990,  Getov  excavated  the  road  leading  into  the  city from  the  western  gate.  Domaradzki  revealed  a  road  surface paved  with  river  stones  and  fired clay sherds at the level of the  early  Makedonian  gateway,  and  a  similar  road  surface made  of  pebbles  close  to  tower  no. 2.  Stone  foundations belonging  to  various  structures  of  the  late  Iron  Age  (second half  of  the  first millennium  bc)  were  discovered  near  the same  tower  and  below  the  floor of  the  Roman  horreum.The foundations  of  an  oval(?)  hut  were  found  near  the  western gate,  together  with  stone  footings  and  clay  floors belonging to  residential  units  whose  design  cannot  as  yet  be  deter- mined. The  most  important  evidence  dating  to  the  first  100  years after  Philip  II's  foundation  comes  from  burials  in  tumuli outside  the  city  (Getov  ( 1991)).  These  suggest  that  local  \u00e9lite families  continued  to  dominate  civic  affairs;  the  names  of moneyers  and  such  information  as  can  be  gleaned  from  epi- graphic  and  written  sources  tend  to  confirm this impression (Draganov  ( 1993);  cf.  Dimitrov  in  Dimitrov  and  Penchev ( 1984)  concerning  Seuthopolis;  Archibald  ( 1998)  311, 315\u00ad16).On  the  basis  of  numismatic,  archaeological  and  epi- graphic  data,  scholars  have  postulated  a  formative  phase  of the  city  while  a  Makedonian  garrison  was  resident, c. 340\u00ad280,  followed  by  a  period  dominated  by  one  or  more local  rulers,  from  c. 280,  with  a  marked  diminution  of  activ- ity  from  C 2  onwards,  precipitated  perhaps  by  the  aggressive campaigns  of  Philip  V. The  spatial  characteristics  of  the  city  in  pre-Imperial  times are  uncertain.  The  agora  and  sanctuary  (Phosphorion)  of Artemis,  mentioned  in  the  Seuthopolis  inscription,  have  not yet  been  located.  The  acropolis  shrine  was  put  out  of  use  by  a tower,  associated  by  Velkov  with  the  introduction  of  the Makedonian  garrison,  but  activities  at  the  shrine  resumed, perhaps  later  in  C 3.  Unpublished  evidence  from  Hisarlik  of extensive  trading  contacts  in  C 5\u00adC4  suggests  that  there  may have  been  a  permanent  settlement  there  before  the  advent  of Philip  II;  but  how  this  changed  in  response  to  the Makedonian  garrison,  and  the  creation  of  a  fortified enclo- sure,  is  still  unknown. Kabyle  minted  coins  on  behalf  of  two  local  leaders, Spartokos  and  Skostokos,  and  later  for  the  Celtic  chieftain Cavarus.  An  autonomous  bronze  coinage  began  some  time in  the  second  quarter  of  C 3,  showing  the  city's  patron  god- dess,  Artemis  Phosphoros,  and  the  legend  (Draganov inland  thrace  893 ( 1993),  ( 1998)).  In  C 3  coins  of  Kabyle  circulated  in  an  area extending  westwards  along  the  upper  Tundja  valley  north  of Nova  Zagora,  and  southwards  some  40  km  downstream (Draganov  ( 1998)  map  1).  The  issues  of  Spartokos  and Skostokos  suggest  that  whatever  power  they  had  was  of  lim- ited  scope  and  duration,  and  that  they  acted  as  lieutenants, or  officials,  rather  than  rulers  (Draganov  ( 1984),  ( 1985); Archibald  ( 1998)  311\u00ad12). 655.

The  incident  is  usually  con- nected  with  the  same  campaign  that  led  to  a  confrontation between  Antipater  and  Parmenio  on  the  Makedonian  side, with  the  \"Tetrachoritai\" on  the  other  (P.Ryl. 1.19  Theopomp.  fr. 217;  cf.

Since  Stephanos  lists  all  eighteen  cities  founded  by Alexander  under  the  heading  ,  the  presump- tion  is  that  the  third  one,  that  in  Thrace,  is  identical  with Plutarch's  Alexandropolis  and  that  its  name  was  in  fact Alexandropolis,  as  reported  by Plutarch.  However,  the  story that  Alexander  founded  a  polis  at  the  age  of 16  or 17  may  be just  another  anecdote  about  Alexander,  of  which  there  are  so many  in  late  sources  (cf.  Fraser  ( 1996)  26  and 29\u00ad30). 653.Apros  Map 52.  Lat. 41.00,long.  27.05.  Size  of  territ- ory:  ?  Type:  C: ? The toponym is   ,  (SEG 37  618; (C 4f);  Steph.

Stephanos  quotes  Theopompos:  '      `   .  It  is  clear  from  the  quote that  the  classification of  Apros  as  a  polis  does  not  stem  from Theopompos.  Thus  the  only  thing  we  know  about  C 4 ", "Philippopolis": "Identifier: 657. , (Philippopolites) Map  22.  Lat. 42.10, long. 24.45.  Size  of  territory:  ?  Type:  B: .  The  toponym  is , (Steph.  Byz. 666.9;  Plin.  HN 4.41; Dexippus  ((FGrHist 100)  fr. 27.1).  The  city-ethnic  is (Steph.  Byz. 666.10,perhaps  just  a  conjec- ture).  Philippopolis  is  called  a  polis  in  late  sources  only (Steph.  Byz.;  Dexippus)  but  probably  by  Theopompos  too, since  the  late  tradition  about  the  nickname   seems  to  be  a  direct  quotation  of  his  work  (Plut.  Mor. 520B; Plin.  HN 4.41;  Suda 1423  Theopomp.  fr. 110,see infra). Philippopolis  (Plovdiv)  is  usually  considered  to  have been  one  of  the  cities  founded  by  Philip  II  when  he  was  con- solidating  his  power  in  Thrace  after  the  defeat  of Kersebleptes,  the  last  independent  ruler  of  the  region  (Diod. 16.71.2).  Diodorus  does  not  name  any  of  the  cities,  but  Pliny says  \"oppidum  sub  Rhodope  Poneropolis  antea,  mox  a  con- ditore  Philippopolis,  nunc  a  situ  Trimontium  dicta\"  (HN 4.11.41),  without  specifying  which  king  was  being  referred to.  But  Dexippus  specifies that Philip is the son of  Amyntas, which  rules  out  Philip  V  (whom  Domaradzki  ( 1993)  36  pre- ferred,  judging  by the  absence  of  any  clear  military  architec- ture  before  the  late  Hellenistic  period).  The  epithet \"Poneropolis\"  derives  from  Theopompos  (fr. 110,see supra), and  is  consistent  with  the  sort  of  moralistic,  disparaging phrases  the  historian  used  liberally  of  Philip  II  (e.g.  fr. 162;  cf. Flower  ( 1994)  119\u00ad30).  Pliny  takes  the  disparaging  name  too literally,  assuming  it  to  have  been  an  earlier  epithet  of Philippopolis. The  historical  origins  of  Philippopolis  lie  in  the  sanctuary that  occupied  part  or  all  of  the  summit  of  Nebet  tepe,  which, together  with  Djambaz  tepe  and  Taksim  tepe,  constituted \"Trimontium\"  under  the  Roman  Empire.  The  earliest  traces of  cult  activity  date  to  the  early  Bronze  Age  (Tsonchev ( 1938);  Peykov ( 1990),  ( 1994),  ( 1995)).  Some  controversy  has attached  to  the  Iron  Age  remains  that  succeeded  these  (see Domaradzki  ( 1998)  22\u00ad29;Popov ( 2000)  125\u00ad26).But  recent excavations  have  shown  that  the  cult  centre  here  was  far larger  and  more  ambitious  in  C 4l  and  C 3e  than  had  previ- ously  been  thought  (Koleva  ( 1997);  Koleva  et al.( 2000) 103\u00ad8).  These  discoveries  have  dispelled  any  doubts  that may  have  existed  about  the  religious  nature  of  activities  on the  summit.  Six  locations  have  been  investigated  in  detail  on the  summit  of  Nebet  tepe,  and  one  below  it,  on  the  eastern side  of  the  ancient  city.  A  concentric  circular  stone  founda- tion  (St.  Matanov  trench)  marks  a  substantial  structure belonging  to  the  late  Bronze  or  beginning  of  the  Iron  Age (i.e.  in  absolute  dates,  end  of  second  and  early  first millenni- um).  Cult  deposits  in  the  area  of  the  temple  continued  until C 6  or  C 5. Approximately  300  m  away,  on  the  same  terrace,  three strata  were  identified belonging t o  the  period  between  C 5 and  C 3.  In  the  latest  stratum  was  the  foundation  of  a  rectan- gular  structure,  oriented  north\u00adsouth,  whose  hard-beaten floor c ontained  a  decorated  hearth  altar  and  a  trapezoidal platform,  the  former  resembling  well-known  types  from Seuthopolis,  Vetren  and  elsewhere  in  Thrace  (Koleva  et al. ( 2000)  104  fig. 1  for  plan;  fig. 3,  hearth  altar).  Elsewhere  rock carvings  bring  this  sanctuary  into  line  with  upland  cult  sites in  the  Sakar  and  Strandja  mountains  and  at  Kabyle  (Zaici vruh).  Twenty-six  pits  associated  with  cult  activity  and  three hearth  altars  were  discovered  on  Kamchya  Street,  at  the north-eastern  foot  of  Nebet  tepe.  This  area  seems  to  be linked  with  activities  on  the  summit  not  just  in  terms  of chronology  (C 6  onwards)  and  function,  but  also  in  the design  of  specific structures.  Some  of  the  pits  were  supersed- ed  by a  roofed  construction,  resembling  the  form  of  a  build- ing  that  succeeded  the  circular  \"temple\"  on  the  summit. There  is  now  growing  agreement  among  scholars  that  D.  Tsonchev  was  right  to postulate  a  fortified enclosure on the  summit  of  Nebet  tepe  before  the  Makedonian  conquest (Tsonchev  ( 1938);  Botusharova  ( 1963);  Domaradzki  ( 1998) 28;  Koleva  et al.( 2000)  110\u00ad11;Popov ( 2000)  129).  Traces  of  a wall  made  of  river  stones  have  been  dated  before  C 6 (Domaradzki  ( 1998)  28,  with  discussion).  The  earliest  sec- tion  of  masonry  in  the  city's  fortifications has been dated t o between  C 3  and  C 2,  and  may  be  connected  with  the  cam- paigns  of  Philip  V  rather  than  Philip  II  (Botusharova ( 1963)). The  nucleus  of  Iron  Age  activity  at  Plovdiv  expanded from  the  summit  of  Nebet  tepe  to  its  surrounding  plain. This  expansion  was  already  in  progress  in  C 6\u00adC5.  A  little further  from  Nebet  tepe,  to  the  south-east,  a  cultural  deposit of  C 4\u00adC3  ( 4  m  below  the  modern  street)  has  revealed domestic  structures  and  abundant  movable  finds (ceramics, including  imported  fine wares,  numerous  loom  weights  and coins  of  Maroneia,  Philip  II  and  Alexander  III).  In  the  vicin- ity  are  burial  mounds  and  flat cremation burials dating 894 archibald from  C 3  to C 2  (Bospachieva  ( 1995),(1997),(2000);  cf.  tumu- lus  with  built  tomb  near  Filipovo  (Botusharova  and Kolarova  ( 1961);  Archibald  ( 1998)  283,  296\u00ad98,  338)). 656.Pistiros  (Pistirenos) Not  in  Barr.,  cf.  infra.  Size  of territory:? Type:C: .  The  toponym  is  (BCH 123 ( 1999)  248\u00ad49,  hereafter  BCH,see infra;  Steph.  Byz. 171.6, 524.11;  Etym.  Magn. 488.10  Hdn. iii.2449.2).  The  city-eth- nic  is  (BCH 16),  Steph.  Byz. 524.11  erroneously conjectures  .  Pistiros  is  classified as a polis  by Etym.  Magn. 488.10,  as  an  emporion  by  Steph.  Byz. 524.11: \u00b5 ).  The  collective  and  external  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  at  BCH 16. Notwithstanding  the  alternative  proposals  put  forward by  Salviat  ( 1999)  and  Bravo  and  Chankowski  ( 1999)  in favour  of  Herodotos'  Pistyros  on  the  Aegean  coast  ( 7.109.2) as  the  location  of  the  epigraphically  attested  Pistiros,  most scholars  have  accepted  the  arguments  put  forward  by  the editors,Velkov  and  Domaradzka,  reinforced  by  the  archaeo- logical  evidence  adduced  by  M.  Domaradzki,  that  the  site  of Adjiyska  Vodenitsa  corresponds  wholly  or  partly  to  the  place and  community  referred  to  in  the  decree  (Velkov  and Domaradzka  ( 1994),  ( 1995),  ( 1996);  Domaradzka  ( 1996), ( 2002a);  Domaradzki  ( 1993),  ( 1995),  ( 1996),  ( 1998),  ( 2000a), ( 2000c),  ( 2002);  Lazova  ( 1996);  Bosnakov ( 1999);  Hansen ( 1997a)  88,  90\u00ad91;  Loukopoulou  ( 1999);  Archibald  ( 1998) 224,  226\u00ad28,(2002a  and  b)). The  main  source  for  Pistiros  is  the  recently  found  C 4 inscription  (BCH,  discussed  supra 887\u00ad90).  It  is  a  renewal  of the  privileges  bestowed  by  the  late  Kotys  on  a  community  of Greeks  in  Pistiros.  As  a  group  the  Greeks  are  called \u00b5,  a  rare  word  presumably  used  synonymously with \u00b5,  but  not  quite: \u00b5  are  traders  who  trav- el  from  place  to place.  The  \u00b5  seem  to  be  the  inhab- itants  of  the  emporion,  only  some  of  whom  were emporoi (ll. 10\u00ad11).  Pistiros  is  not  explicitly  called  an  \u00b5, but  from  the  term emporitai  and  the  reference  to other emporia  in  the  neighbourhood  (ll. 22\u00ad24)  it  seems  safe  to infer  that  the  place  was  an  emporion,  an  inference  sup- ported  by  Stephanos'  note: ,  \u00b5  ( 524.11). In  constitutional  terms,  Pistiros  appears  to  be  a  polis,  not just  an  urban  centre,  but  it  also  enjoyed  some  degree  of autonomy,  which  was  asserted,  as  well  as  constrained,  by  the unnamed  ruler  in  relation  to  other  named  and  unnamed groups.  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  terminology  of  the  decree might  be  distinguishing  between  oi  Pistirenoi  (l. 16)  and \"Apollonians  and  Thasians  who  are  in  Pistiros\"  (ll. 32\u00ad33; Maronitans,  l. 28,  also  understood?).  But  the  reference  to Pistirenians  comes  from  the  main  body  of  the  decree,  while the  latter  distinction  is  contained  in  the  citation  attributed to  Kotys  (I). To  understand  the  status  of  Pistiros,  one  must  start  with the  toponym  (ll. 12,  22\u00ad24,  33)  and  the  ethnic \u00b5(l.16).Pistiros is a rare name,and it seems rea- sonable  to  assume  that  there  must  have  been  some  connec- tion  between  the  polis  Pistiros  on  the  coast  and  the homonymous  inland  emporion,  and  that  the  Pistirenians living  in  the  emporion  were  citizens  of  the  polis,  just  as  oth- ers  among  the  inhabitants  were  citizens  of  Apollonia, Maroneia  and  Thasos  (Hansen  ( 2004);  Velkov  and Domaradzka  ( 1994)  7;  Loukopoulou  ( 1999)  368  assumes  a transfer  of  the  settlement,  i.e.  a  metoikesis).  It  is  nowhere stated  that  the  citizens  of  Apollonia,  Maroneia  and  Thasos were among  the  emporitai the  Pistirinians. The Maronitai,  Apolloniatai  and  Thasioi  may  well  have  been emporoi,  i.e.  travelling  merchants  or  merchants  living  for  a shorter  or  longer  period  in  Pistiros  without  becoming  cit- izens  of  the  community. One  possible  scenario  is  as  follows  (Hansen  ( 2004)).  The emporion  of  Pistiros  was  an  inland  trading  station,  original- ly  founded  by  merchants  coming  from  the  polis  of  Pistiros,  a dependency  of  Thasos  situated  on  the  Thracian  coast  (Hdt. 7.109.2).  The  core  of  the  settlers  (    in  l. 38) were  from  the  outset  citizens  of  the  polis  Pistiros  (cf. \u00b5  at  l. 16),  but  some  of  the  other  inhabitants were  citizens  of  Maroneia,  Apollonia  and  Thasos  (ll. 27\u00ad33), and  in  C 4  they  may  have  formed  the  most  important  ele- ment  of  the  population.  It is  apparent  from  the  inscription that  it  was  only  one  out  of  a  number  of  emporia  in  inland Thrace  involved  principally  in  trade  with  Maroneia  (ll. 21\u00ad24).  The  emporion  was  surrounded  by  native  Thracians (    in  ll. 8\u00ad9).  The  mixture  of  four  different  ethnics  suggests  that  Pistiros  was  not  an  ordinary  polis  in its  own  right.  But  we  cannot  exclude  the  possibility  that  Pistiros  was  a  kind  of  dependent  polis  whose  citizens  are  described  as  ,  and  that  the  , the and  the  lived  in  Pistiros  as  metics. At  present  the  origins  of  the  emporion  are  uncertain.  The site  at  Adjiyska  Vodenitsa  was  occupied  some  time  in  C 5 (Bouzek  ( 2002a)  discusses  the  evidence  prior  to C 5s). Excavations  have  yet  to  reveal  the  character  of  the  earliest settlement.  During  C 5s,  the  area  was  (re)organised  in  a  for- mal  manner,  based  on  a  street  system  integrated  with  the fortification walls and the eastern gateway,  through  which inland  thrace  895 the  main  east\u00adwest  road  runs  (Domaradzki  ( 1993),  ( 1995), ( 1996),  ( 2002)).  This  east\u00adwest  road  has  at  least  three  major surfaces,  which  mirror  the  key  events  that  affected  life  on  the site  in  its  three  phases.  The  initial  plan  consisted  of  an  ambi- tious  double-faced  masonry  wall  enclosing  a  grid  plan  of streets,  paved  with  ashlar  slabs,  similar  to  the  wall  itself  and the  main  drain.  Some  time  in  C 4f,  perhaps  in  the  370s,  the eastern  gateway  was  modified substantially,  with  the  recon- struction  of  the  exterior  tower.  This  reconstruction  heralds a  phase  of  spectacular  internal  development,  both  architec- tural  and  commercial.  Multi-roomed  structures,  on  stone footings,  roofed  with  imported  and  locally  made  tiles,  can certainly  be  traced  back  to  this  period.  The  largest  number of  bulk  imports,  including  storage  amphoras  from  Chios, Thasos  and  elsewhere  in  the  Aegean,  together  with  Attic  fig- ured  and  black-glazed  pottery,  belong  to  this  period.  C. 300, the  eastern  gateway  perished  in  a  fierce blaze and was never rebuilt  in  the  same  form.  The  successor  gateway  was  far more  modest  and  lacked  many  of  the  specific defensive fea- tures  of  its  predecessor.  The  road  was  relaid  with  cobbles made  of  river  stones,  not  dressed  slabs  (Domaradzki  ( 1993), ( 1995),  ( 1996),  ( 2002)).  There  followed  a  lengthy  period  of redevelopment,  involving  the  reuse  of  older  materials.  Some areas  seem  to  have  changed  their  function  (Domaradzki ( 1999);  Archibald  et al.( 2002)).  The  interpretation  of  this phase  is  still  in  progress. One  of  the  most  remarkable  aspects  of  the  finds at V etren is  the  large  number  of  coins  discovered  during  the  excava- tions.  The  total  number  currently  stands  at  c. 1,800  items.  A pot  hoard  of 552  Makedonian  coins,  datable  to  the  280s,  was found  by  the  Czech  team  in  a  building  adjacent  to  the east\u00adwest  road.  The  coins  range  from  rare  regal  issues  of Amadokos  I,  Kotys  I,  Amadokos  II  and  other  Thracian rulers,  to  imitation  Thasian  denominations,  silver  from Parion,  the  Chersonese,  Mesembria  and  Apollonia  on  the Black  Sea,  as  well  as  other  Aegean  civic  coins.  Other  items  of commercial  significance include w eights  and  measures,  and graffiti.  Domestic  items  include  loom  weights,  spindle whorls,  gaming  tokens,  metallic  pins,  needles,  ornaments and  other  equipment,  together  with  tools  for  domestic  and industrial  (metallurgical)  use. 657. "}, "Euboia": {"Eretria": "Identifier: 480 , supported the  Ionian  revolt  with  five t riremes  (Hdt. 5.99.1).Their  crews assisted  in  the  capture  of  Sardes,  and  their  strategos  was killed  in  the  ensuing  battle  of  Ephesos  (Hdt. 5.102.3;  cf.  also Lysanias  (FGrHist 426)  fr. 1).  Therefore,  Eretria  was  the  first main  target  of  the  Persian  punitive  expedition  against  Hellas in 490  (Hdt. 6.98.1).  Having  pillaged  the  countryside,  the Persians  laid  siege  to  Eretria,  and  on  the  seventh  day  the  city was  betrayed  by  two  leading  citizens  and  conquered  (Hdt. 6.100\u00ad1);  the  sanctuaries  were  burnt  down,  and  the  popula- tion  exposed  to  andrapodismos:  men,  women  and  children were  sent  to  Sousa  and  were  settled  in  the  neighbourhood where  their  descendants  still  lived  in  C 5m  (Hdt. 6.106.2, 107.2,115,118\u00ad19;  Pl.  Menex. 240A;  Philostr.  VA 1.24,probably based  on  Ktesias  (letter  from  Knoepfler)).  In  spite  of  the andrapodismos  the  Eretrians  were  capable  of  fighting w ith seven  triremes  at  Artemision  (Hdt. 8.1.2)  and  at  Salamis (Hdt. 8.46.2).  Together  with  Styra  (no. 377)  they  provided 600  hoplites  at  Plataiai  (Hdt. 9.28.5)  and  are  duly  recorded on  the  Serpent  Column  (ML  27.8). Eretria  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League,  and  may  have been  among  the  original  members  (ATL  iii. 198\u00ad99).  It belonged  to  the  Island  district  (IG i\u00b3  269.v.30)  and  is  record- ed  in  the  tribute  lists  from  448/7  (IG i\u00b3  264.iv.11)  to  430/29 (IG i\u00b3  281.ii.51),  a  total  of  nine  times,  twice  completely 652 reber,  hansen  and  ducrey restored,  paying  a  phoros  of,  perhaps, 6  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  264.ic.11) but  later  3  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  281.ii.51),  perhaps  from  441/40  (IG i\u00b3 271.ii.97).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.67:  15 tal.),  and  in  413  Eretria  was  still  listed  among  the  paying members  (Thuc. 7.57.4).  In  446  Eretria  joined  Chalkis  in defecting  from  Athens;  but  the  revolt  was  quenched  by  an Athenian  army  under  Perikles  (Thuc. 1.114.1\u00ad3).  The  condi- tions  imposed  on  Eretria  seem  to  have  been  similar  to  those of  Chalkis  (IG i\u00b3  39;  40.40\u00ad43;  supra 648),  and  no  klerouchy is  attested  (Gehrke,  Stasis 64  n. 9).  On  the  other  hand,  a decree  of 442/1  ordered  that  the  sons  of  the  richest  Eretrians be  sent  to  Athens  as  hostages  (Hesych. 5746;  Phot. 1908). The  assessment  in  425/4  resulted  in  yet  another  Euboian revolt,  which  Eretria  probably  joined  (Philoch.  fr. 130;  Paus. 1.29.2;  cf.  Knoepfler ( 1996)).  After  initial  contacts  with Sparta  (no. 345)  in  413  (Thuc. 8.5.1),  Eretria  defected  from Athens  once  again  in  411  in  connection  with  the  Athenian defeat  in  the  naval  battle  fought  outside  the  harbour  of  the city  (Thuc. 8.95.3\u00ad6). In c. 400  Eretria  concluded  an  alliance  with Histiaia/Oreos  (no. 372)  (IG xii.9188  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 205; cf.  Knoepfler ( 2001)  82),and  in  394  one  with  Athens  (no. 361) (IG ii\u00b2  16  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 229).  In  C 4e  a  sympoliteia  agree- ment  was  concluded  with  Keos  (SEG 14  530  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 232;  but  see  Cargill  ( 1981)  136  n. 14).  The  Eretrians  were among  the  original  members  of  the  Second  Athenian  Naval League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.81).  But  they  probably  left  the  League together  with  Thebes  (no. 221)  in  371  or  shortly  afterwards (Dreher  ( 1995)  173;  Knoepfler ( 1995)  331\u00ad33).  In  any  case, Eretria  cannot  have  been  a  member  of  the  League  when  in 366  Themison,  the  tyrant  of  Eretria,  dispossessed  Athens  of Oropos  (no. 214)  (Diod. 15.76.1).  Like  the  other  Euboian poleis,  however,  Eretria  was  torn by stasis  between  a  pro- Theban  and  a  pro-Athenian  faction  (Gehrke,  Stasis 65).  In 357  both  Athenian  and  Theban  forces  invaded  the  island  and clashed  in  several  battles  and  skirmishes.  The  Athenians won,  and  the  Euboian  poleis  rejoined  the  League  (Diod. 16.7.2;  Aeschin. 3.85;Dem.  8.74;  IG ii\u00b2  124.16  Tod 153, improved  readings  in  Knoepfler ( 1995)  335\u00ad37;  Brunt  ( 1969) 247\u00ad48).  In  349/8  an  Athenian  army  under  Phokion  came  to the  rescue  of  Ploutarchos,  the  tyrant  of  Eretria,  who,  how- ever,  betrayed  the  Athenians  (Plut.  Phoc. 12\u00ad13;Gehrke ( 1976)  7\u00ad11).  After  the  Athenian  victory  at  Tamynai,  Eretria joined  the  League  again,  as  attested  in  the  Athenian  decree of,  probably, 343  (IG ii\u00b2  125;  cf.  SEG 34  67,  45  1210).  The Eretrians  provided  synedroi  for  the  synedrion  and  con- tributed  a  syntaxis  of 5  tal.  (Aeschin. 3.94,  100).  In  the  same period  Philip  of  Makedon  seems  to  have  infiltrated E uboia (Dem. 9.57,  10.8;  Brunt  ( 1969)  251\u00ad52),  and  in  342  he  had  the leaders  of  his  faction  in  Eretria  installed  as  tyrants  (infra). After  their  expulsion  in  341  a  new  alliance  between  Athens and  Eretria  was  concluded  (IG ii\u00b2  230;see Knoepfler ( 1985)). In 340  some  kind  of  short-lived  league  with  a  common council  was  established  under  the  leadership  of  Kallias  of Chalkis  (Aeschin. 3.89,  94;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 342);  it  included Eretria,  Chalkis  (no. 365)  and  Histiaia/Oreos  (no. 372). Because  of  the  contemporary  issue  of  a  common  Euboian coinage  (supra 643)  the  union  has  sometimes  been  inter- preted  as  a  federation  (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 342;  Picard  ( 1979)),but see  Beck  ( 1997)  28. The  Eretrian  constitution  was  one  of  the  158  politeiai described  by  Aristotle  and  his  pupils  (Heracl.  Lemb. 40  Arist.  no. 45,  Gigon;  cf.  Plut.  Mor. 293A,  298B).  In  the Archaic  period  Eretria  was  an  oligarchy  governed  by  the class  of  hippeis  who  formed  the  core  of  the  Eretrian  army (Arist.  Pol. 1289b33\u00ad39,  1306a33\u00ad39;  Ath.  Pol. 15.2).  This  con- stitution  was  overturned  in  C 6s  and  perhaps  before  510  (IG xii.9  p. 147.111\u00ad24)  at  the  instigation  of  a  certain  Diagoras (Arist.  Pol. 1306a35\u00ad36;  Heracl.  Lemb. 40),  and  it  was replaced  by  \"a  democracy\"  (Gehrke,  Stasis 63;  cf.  IG xii Suppl. 549A:  [     ]     [ \u00b5] (C5e); cf.  Knoepfler ( 2001)  74  n. 293).  The  common  view  that,  in 446,  a  democratic  constitution  was  either  maintained  or, alternatively,  imposed  by  the  Athenians  (Balcer  ( 1978)  56; Gehrke,  Stasis 64)  is  based  on  an  analogy  with  a  not  alto- gether  convincing  interpretation  of  the  Athenian  regula- tions  for  Chalkis  (ATL  iii. 150  no. 15).  An honorary  decree  of c. 411,  passed  by  the  boule  alone  and  not  by  (the  boule  and) the  demos,  indicates  that  the  defection  from  Athens  in  411 was  followed  by  the  introduction  of  an  oligarchic  constitu- tion  (IG xii.9  187A).  But  a  somewhat  later  honorary  decree inscribed  on  the  same  stele  is  passed  by  the  boule  and  the demos,  suggesting  a  democracy  in  C 4e  (IG xii.9  187B). Later  in  C 4  Eretria  was  ruled  by  a  number  of  tyrants  (Berve ( 1967)  301\u00ad2):  Themison  from  before  366  to 357  (Aeschin. 3.85;Dem.  18.99;Diod 15.76.1),  Menestratos  in  352  (Dem. 23.124),  Plutarchos  from  before  350  to 348  (Dem. 5.5,  9.57, 21.110,  200;  Aeschin. 3.86;Plut.  Phoc. 12\u00ad13).  Plutarchos  was deposed  by  the  Eretrian  demos  led  by  Kleitarchos  (schol. Dem. 5.5),  but  after  a  short  period  of  democratic  government (Dem. 9.57),Kleitarchos  was  himself  in  342  installed  by  Philip of  Makedon  as  tyrannos  of  Eretria  together  with  Hipparchos and  Automedon  (Dem. 9.58;  cf. 18.71,  79\u00ad81,  295;  Aeschin. 3.103;Harp. 15;  Gehrke  ( 1976)).  In  the  following  year,  how- ever,  Eretria  was  besieged  and  conquered  by  an  Athenian force  (Philoch.  fr. 160),  and  the  tyrants  were expelled  again euboia  653 (schol.  Aeschin. 3.85;Diod.  16.74.1).  A  democracy  was  set  up (Philoch.  fr. 160),  an  anti-tyranny  law  passed  by  the  Eretrian people  (IG xii.9190  (c. 340)),  and  a  sacred  law  belongs  in  the same  context  (IG xii.9189  LSCG 92).Decrees  passed  under the  new  democratic  regime  are  introduced  with  the  formula  ~    ~ \u00b5  (IG xii.9  189.4  (c. 340)),  or  ~ \u00b5  (Knoepfler ( 2001)  2  ( 330\u00ad320))  or,  once,  ~   (Knoepfler ( 2001)  1.2\u00ad3),  and  bills  are often  moved  by  a  board  of  probouloi  (IG xii.9191.35). The  eponymous  officials w ere  a  board  of  three  archontes (LSAG 84  no. 9;  SEG 34  898  (C 6l);  IG xii.9191.A.8  (C 4l);  cf. Sherk  ( 1990)  238).  The  principal  military  officials w ere  a board  of  strategoi  (IG xii.9191.44;  Hdt. 5.102.3)  and  a  board of  five taxiarchoi  (IG ii\u00b2  230b.12\u00ad17),  each  presumably  com- manding  a  regiment  provided  by  one  of  the  five districts (Knoepfler ( 1997)  372).Alongside  the  five(?) taxeis  there  was a  cavalry  of,  probably, 500  hippeis 100  per  district  (IG ii\u00b2 230a.3\u00ad4  as  restored  by Knoepfler ( 1985)  SEG 35  59). Together  with  the  other  Euboian  poleis  Eretria  was  a  mem- ber  of  the  Amphiktyonic  League  (Lef\u00e8vre ( 1998)  59\u00ad63),  and provided  in  some  years  one  of  the  two  Ionian  hieromnemones (Aeschin. 2.116;  CID ii  102.i.9),  in  other  years  a  tamias  (CID ii 74.47).  Athenian  envoys  were  sent  to  Eretria  in  357/6  (IG ii\u00b2 124.16)  and  in  340  (Aeschin. 3.100).  Eretrian  envoys  were  sent to Athens  (IG ii\u00b2  230b).  Eretria  granted  citizenship  to  a  man of  Sikyon  (no. 228)  (Knoepfler ( 2001)  1  (C 4s))  and  proxenia  to citizens  of  Opous  (no. 386)  (Knoepfler ( 2001)  4  (C 4l))  and Taras  (no. 71)  (IG xii.9  187A  and  B  (C 5\u00adC4)  Knoepfler ( 2001)  ii\u00adiii);  see  also  Knoepfler ( 2001)  2  ( 330\u00ad320).  Eretrian citizens  received  proxenia  from  Delphi  (no. 177)  (SEG 16  319 (C 4\u00adC3))  and  Karthaia  (no. 492)  (IG xii.5542.8  (C 4m)).  In C 4s  Eretria  had  a  theorodokos  to  host  theoroi  from  Nemea (SEG 36  331.B.41\u00ad43  ( 331/0\u00ad313)). Only  one  Eretrian  citizen  is  attested  as  victor  in  the Olympic  Games  (Olympionikai 177  (c. 492)),  and  none  in any  of  the  other  major  Panhellenic  games. The  Pantheon  of  Eretria  in  the  Classical  period  is  almost exclusively  known  from  inscriptions  and  archaeological evidence  (Schachter  ( 1992)  18\u00ad21;  Novaro  ( 1996)).  The  tute- lary  god  of  Eretria  was  Apollo  Daphnephoros  (IG xii.9 191.10,  49;  Knoepfler ( 2001)  17),  in  whose  sanctuary  public enactments  were  published  (IG xii.9210.26\u00ad29).  Divinities worshipped  in  the  town  itself  were  Aphrodite?  (Themelis ( 1982)  179),  Asklepios  (IG xii.9194  (C 4\u00adC3);  LSCG 93), Dionysos  (IG xii.9192,207.45  with  SEG 34  896  (C 3e?)),Hera (IG xii.9189.27),  Poseidon  (Knoepfler ( 2000))  and Demeter,  for  whom  thesmophoria  are  attested  (Plut.  Mor. 298B,  probably  derived  from  the  Aristotelian  Politeia;  cf. Metzger  ( 1985);  Willers  ( 1991)).  The  two  major  extra-urban cults  were  those  of  Artemis  Amarysia  at  Amarynthos  with musical  contests  (IG xii.9189  LSGC 92;  IG xii.9191.57,  59, 195.10\u00ad12;  Knoepfler ( 1988)  383\u00ad91)  and  Apollo  at  Tamynai (Harp. 3;Strabo 10.1.10;  IG xii.990\u00ad92). The  Eretrian  calendar  is  typically  Euboian.  The  month Antestherion  is  attested  in  C 4s  (IG xii.9189  LSCG 92), and  the  months  Apatourion,  Lenaion  and  Heraion  in  the  C 3 law  concerning  the  Dionysian  artists  (IG xii.9207;see Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 39\u00ad41). The  city  of  Eretria  is  bordered  to the  south  by the  sea,  to the  west  by  a  stream,  to  the  north  by  a  hill  which  naturally became  the  acropolis;  to  the  east  was  an  area  of  marshy ground.  The  ancient  port  lay  partly  in  the  same  vicinity  as the  modern  port. The  urban  area  of  modern  Eretria  in  the  1960s  gives  some idea  of  its  extent  in  C 4.  At  that  time,  it  was  surrounded  by  a high  city  wall  which,  starting  from  the  sea  in  the  west,  fol- lowed  the  western  side  of  the  acropolis,  then  ran  along  its steepest  slope  on  the  north,  then  turned  south  to  the  sea  to complete  the  circuit.  The  port  itself  was  fortified b y  a  cur- tain-wall  and  towers.  At  intervals  along  the  city  wall  were posterns,  a  monumental  gate  to  the  west  (Krause  ( 1972)) and  an  eastern  gate  that  has  not  been  found.  We  know  that the  city  was  protected  by  a  wall  in  490,since  the  Persians  had to  lay  siege  for  six  days,  and  Eretria  fell  only  because  of treachery  (Hdt. 6.101.2),  whereafter  the  walls  were demol- ished  (Strabo  10.1.10).  In  our  current  state  of  knowledge  it  is impossible  to  date  the  first fortifications  with  any  certainty. The  existing  wall,  with  its  gates,  posterns  and  towers,  dates from  C 4.  It  was  about  4,260  m  in  length;  the  total  area enclosed  by  the  wall  was  about  81.5  ha.  The  top  of  the  acrop- olis  was  123  m  from  the  sea.  Eretria  was  besieged  in  341 (Philoch.  fr. 160). The  first t races  of  occupation  on  the  acropolis  date  to  the second  millennium  (AntK  ( 1994)  94\u00ad96,(1995)  108\u00ad19, ( 1996)  107\u00ad11).  Middle  Helladic  remains  have  been  found  in the  plain,  not  far  from  the  future  agora.  During  the Protogeometric  period  (C 9),  only  the  tombs  attest  to  some sort  of  human  presence  (AntK  ( 2000)  134\u00ad45).  The  first evidence  of  settlement,  dating  from  C 8,  comes  from  three areas:  near  the  port,  on  the  site  of  the  later  sanctuary  of Apollo,  and  at  several  places  at  the  foot  of  the  acropolis.  The buildings  were  oval  or  apsidal  in  plan,  with  the  entrance  on the  short  side  (AntK  ( 1981)  85\u00ad86,(2000)  128\u00ad30,(2001) 84\u00ad87).  A  group  of  tombs  also  dates  from  C 8;  their  location was  marked  on  the  ground  by  a  triangular  stone  structure, and  they  contained  exceptionally  rich  grave-goods  (bronze 654 reber,  hansen  and  ducrey cauldrons,  gold  jewellery,  iron  weapons,  a  bronze  spear- head).  They  have  been  interpreted  as  a  heroon.  The  remains of  later  buildings  nearby have been  attributed  to a  heroic cult  (B\u00e9rard  ( 1970)). The  oldest  buildings  in  the  area  of  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo Daphnephoros,  apsidal  in  plan,  were  followed  at  the  end  of C 8  by  a  longer  edifice (a hekatompedon),  also  with  an  apse. Because  of  the  altar  at  its  east  end  and  the  finds of  offerings and  pottery,  this  has  been  identified as the first  temple  of Apollo,  the  city's  chief  divinity.  A  second  temple,  rectangu- lar  in  plan,  perhaps  Ionic,  preceded  the  large  Doric  hexastyle temple  of  C 6l  which  was  burned  down  by  the  Persians  in  490 (Hdt. 6.101.3;  Auberson  ( 1968)). To  the  north  of  the  temple  of  Apollo,  a  sacrificial area w ith a  deposit  of  sacred  objects  has  yielded  numerous  offerings, the  earliest  dating  from  C 8;  some  came  from  the  Middle East,  others  from  Egypt  and  from  the  West.  The  cult  cele- brated  there  was  perhaps  dedicated  to  a  female  divinity (Huber  ( 2003)).  The  foundations  of  another  sanctuary  were discovered  cut  in  the  rock  at  the  top  of  the  acropolis;  they were  accompanied  by  offerings  similar  to  those  found  in  the sacred  deposit  in  the  sacrificial area.  The  divinity  honoured is  uncertain,  but  the  offerings  suggest  that  it  may  have  been female  (AntK  ( 1994)  97\u00ad99). Among  the  other  religious  buildings  for  which  there  is archaeological  evidence,  the  temple  of  Dionysos,  located next  to  the  theatre  (Auberson  ( 1976)),  may  date  from  C 4e, while  the  siting  of  a  thesmophorion  on  the  south  slope  of  the acropolis  is  controversial  (Metzger  ( 1985);  Muller  ( 1996) 165\u00ad68;Willers  ( 1991)).Several  clues  suggest  that  a  sanctuary of  Asklepios  was  situated  in  the  neighbourhood  of  the House  of  the  Mosaics.  The  large  sanctuary  of  Artemis Amarynthia  lies  outside  the  city  but  in  the  chora,about 10 km  to  the  south.  Its  approximate  location  is  known,  but  the temple  proper  has  not  yet  been  found  (Knoepfler ( 1988)). No  public  or  official buildings have y et  come  to  light. However,  we  do  know  the  location  of  the  agora  from  the Archaic  and  Classical  periods,  which  was  near  the  sanctuary of  Apollo  Daphnephoros.  The  porticos  along  four  sides  have been  located  or  partially  cleared.  The  function  of  an  elegant circular  building  (tholos)  on  the  east  side  of  the  agora remains  unknown.  To  the  north  of  the  agora  a large  fountain provided  a  public  water-supply;  long  sections  of  the  con- duits  have  been  uncovered.  Other  conduits  for  supplying fresh  water  and  carrying  away  waste  have  been  found  under several  streets. The  main  street  linked  the  west  gate  to  the  east  gate,  pass- ing  to  the  south  of  the  theatre  and  along  the  southern  flank of  the  acropolis.  Halfway  between  the  two  gates,  another street  branched  off  towards  the  agora,  skirting  the  sanctuary of  Apollo  on  the  way.  Other  streets  have  been  found  in  vari- ous  parts  of  the  city,  the  longest  in  the  western  quarter (Reber  ( 1998)). Eretria  had  a  huge  theatre  (TGR  ii. 215\u00ad16),  and  some  of the  earliest  phases  may  date  to  C 4;  cf.  IG xii.9193.6  (C 4l),  a gymnasium,  a  palaestra  and  baths.  Although  the  visible remains  of  these  buildings  are  no  older  than  the  Hellenistic period,  it  is  reasonable  to  suppose  that  they  were  already functioning  in  C 4  or  even  earlier. The  Classical  and  Hellenistic  areas  of  the  city  are  well known  thanks  to  the  systematic  exploration  of  the  vast houses,  some  of  which  are  particularly  luxurious  (Reber ( 1998);  Ducrey  et al.( 1993)). Eretria  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard, c. 525\u00ad446  and  c. 411\u00ad400.  Denominations:  tetradrachm, didrachm,  drachm,  diobol,  obol,  hemiobol.  The  most  com- mon  types  are  obv.  cow  scratching  itself,  sometimes  with  a bird  on  its  back;  rev.  octopus  in  incuse  square.  The  legend is  found  only  on  C 2  bronze  coins  (Head, HN \u00b2  360\u00ad64;Kraay ( 1976)  91\u00ad92;  SNG  Cop.  Aetolia-Euboea 468\u00ad96).  It  is  not  known  whether  the  C 4  and  C 3  \"federal\" issues  were  struck  by  Eretria  (Wallace  ( 1956))  or  by Chalkis (no. 365)  (Picard  ( 1979));  see  also  Brunner  ( 1998)  and  supra 649. Eretria  was  involved  in  the  colonisation  of  Dikaia  (no. 568), Mende  (no. 584),  Methone  ( 541),  Okolon  ( 626),  Pharbelos (no. 591),  Pithekoussai  (no. 65)  and  Skabala  (no. 607). 371.  *Grynchai  (Gryncheus) Map  55.

The  toponym  is  * or  * ,  (reconstruct- ed  from  the  form  (IG xii.9249B.361  (C 3))  com- bined  with  the  variant  forms;  cf.  Knoepfler ( 1997)  359); variant  forms  are  (Steph.

Grynchai  is  not called  a  polis  in  any  source,  but  the  attestation  of  the  com- munity  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  is  an  indication  of  polis status,  as  is  the  peculiar  incorporation  of  the  Gryncheis  into all  six  Eretrian  phylai  (infra).  Grynchai  has  been  located near  modern  Krieza,  where  tombs  and  architectural  frag- ments  have  been  found  (Gehrke  ( 1988)  33\u00ad34;  Knoepfler ( 1997)  384  with  n. 250). Grynchai  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League,  and  may have  been  among  the  original  members  (ATL  iii. 198\u00ad99).  It euboia  655 belonged  to  the  Island  district  (IG i\u00b3  270.v.22)  and  is  record- ed  in  the  tribute  lists  from  451/50  (IG i\u00b3  262.i.24)  to  416/5  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.23),  a  total  of  thirteen  times,  three  times  completely restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  262.i.24).  It was assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.81:  2,000  dr.). In C 5l  (Knoepfler ( 1997)  354),Grynchai  became  a  deme  of Eretria  (no. 370),  belonging  to  the  third  district  (Knoepfler ( 1997)  384,  402).  The  Gryncheis  were  divided  among  all  six Eretrian  phylai  (IG xii.9245A.158,  246A.181ff,  247.i.9; Knoepfler ( 1997)  393\u00ad400). 372.  Histiaia  (Histiaieus)/Oreos  (Oreites) Map  55.

The  change  of  name  (Robert  ( 1951)  179  n. 2)  is  explicitly mentioned  in  several  sources  (Paus. 7.26.4;  schol.  Thuc. 1.114),  and  at  Strabo  10.1.3  it  is  connected  with  the  establish- ment  of  an  Athenian  klerouchy in  446.  But  the  sources  testi- fy  to  a  considerable  overlap  between  the  two  names  (cf. Strabo  10.1.4).  Both  toponyms  are  attested  in  Thucydides, Hestiaia  at  7.57.2  and  Oreos  at  8.95.7.  The  earliest  attestation of  the  toponym  Oreos  is  in  Ar.  Pax 1047,  1057,  whereas  the toponym  Histiaia  (in  a  contemporary  context)  is  attested  as late  as  C 4f(IG  xii.5594.12  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 287),  and  the city-ethnic  Histiaieus  in  inscriptions  of  C 3  (CID ii  126.2 (C 3f);  IG xii.9  1186.12  (C 3s))  and  on  coins  of  C 2  (Head,  HN \u00b2 364\u00ad65).  Histiaia/Oreos  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban sense  (Hdt. 8.23.2;  Ps.-Skylax 58;Dem.  9.61,  62)  and  in  the political  sense  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.57;Dem.  9.59\u00ad60;  Aeschin. 3.94;  Arist.  Pol. 1303b32\u00ad3;  IG xii.5594.3  (C 4f);  IG xii.9 188.6\u00ad7  (C 4f)). is  found  in  Semon. 9.62.  The  col- lective  sense  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on  C 4 coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  inscriptions  (IG xii.5594.15 (C 4f))  and  in  literature  (Hdt. 8.23.2;  Thuc. 7.57.2;Dem. 23.213).  The  individual  and  external  use  is  attested  in inscriptions  (IG  xii.97.9  (C 4m);  CID ii  93.51  ( 329/8))  and  in literature  (Hdt. 8.23.1;  Aeschin. 3.223). The  territory is  called  `  (Hdt. 7.175.2, 8.23.2).  From  C 4m  it  comprised  all  of  northern  Euboia, some 850  km \u00b2,  and  bordered  on  the  territory of  Chalkis  (no. 365).At  23.213  Demosthenes  claims  that  the  Oreitans  inhab- ited  a  quarter  of  the  island  ( \u00b5 ).  The  exact frontier  is  unknown,  but  it  seems  to  have  crossed  the  island north  of  Kerinthos  but  south  of  Elymnion  (Gehrke ( 1994) 336\u00ad41).  Down to C 4f  Dion  (no. 368)  and  Athenai  Diades (no. 364),  both  on  the  Kenaion  peninsula,  were  self-govern- ing  poleis,  and  so  were,  probably,  Orobiai  (no. 374)  on  the west  coast  of  Euboia  and  Poseidion  (no. 376)  on  the  east coast  (infra 660).  In  the  Hellenistic  period  all  four  are  attest- ed  as  demes  of  Oreos:  Athenai  Diades  (IG xii.9  1186.2),Dion (IG xii.9  1187.3),  Orobiai  (IG xii.9  1186.3)  and  Poseidion  (IG xii.9  1189.20,  28,  39).  Some  thirty  demes  are  recorded  in Hellenistic  inscriptions  (IG xii.9  1186\u00ad89;  Jones,  POAG 77\u00ad78).  We  hear  about  Histiaian  demes  already  in  C 5s  (IG i\u00b3 41.100),  and  in  C 4m  the  citizens  of  Histiaia/Oreos  were  organised  into  tribes  and  demes  (IG xii.5 594.10  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 287).  The  board  of  six  archontes (infra)  indicates  that  there  were  six  phylai  as  in  Eretria  (no. 370)  (Knoepfler b y  letter).  Oreos  (Theopomp.  fr. 387) and  Dion  (IG i\u00b3  41.101)  are  the  only  named  Hellenistic demes  which  can  be  traced  back  to  the  Classical  period (supra).  In  480,however,the  core  territory  of  Histiaia/Oreos comprised  a  number  of  komai  along  the  coast  (Hdt. 8.23.2), of  which  two  may  have  been  Khironisi  and  Oreos  (Sackett  et al.( 1966)  111;  for  Khironisi/Dion,  see  also  Reber  ( 2001) 456\u00ad60). After  the  battle  of  Artemision  in  480 ", "Histiaia/Oreos": "Identifier: 373. , was conquered  by  the  Persians,  and  its  territory  was  ravaged (Hdt. 8.23.2).  Histiaia/Oreos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian League,  and  may  have  been  among  the  original  members (ATL  iii. 198\u00ad99).  It is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  in  450/49 (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.34),  448/7  (IG i\u00b3  264.iii.6)  and  447/6  (IG i\u00b3 265.ii.36),  paying  a  phoros  of 1,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  265.ii.36). In 446  Hestiaia  joined  the  other  Euboian  poleis  and defected  from  Athens;  but  the  revolt  was  soon  quenched  by an  Athenian  army  under  Perikles;  the  Histiaians  were expelled  from  their  city  and  sent  to  Makedonia,  while Histiaia/Oreos  was  settled  with  Athenians  (Thuc. 1.114.1\u00ad3, 7.57.2,  8.95.7;  Theopomp.  fr. 387;  Philoch.  fr. 118;Diod.  12.7.1, 22.2;Plut.  Per. 23.4).  The  Athenians  are  described  as colonists  (apoikoi,  Thuc. 7.57.2;  Figueira  ( 1991)  223)  and numbered  2,000  (Theopomp.  fr. 387)  rather  than  the  1,000  reported  at  Diod. 12.22.2,  where,  probably, is  used  in  a  non-technical  sense  (cf.  Ael. VH 6.1  with  Figueira  ( 1991)  258\u00ad60).  The  Athenian  regula- tions  for  the  new  colony  include  references  to a  Histiaian boule,a dikasterion  and  an  archon  (IG i\u00b3  41;  cf.  Koch  ( 1991) 656 reber,  hansen  and  ducrey 181\u00ad82,  192\u00ad93).  They  also  show  that  a  part  of  the  original population  remained  in  the  territory  (ibid. 182\u00ad83).  In  415  a contingent  of  the  Athenian  colonists  joined  the  expedition to  Sicily  (Thuc. 7.57.2),  and  in  411  Histiaia/Oreos  remained loyal  and  did  not  join  the  other  Euboian  cities  in  defecting from  Athens  (Thuc. 8.95.7;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 33.1).At the  end  of the  Peloponnesian  War,  the  Athenian  colonists  in Histiaia/Oreos  were  undoubtedly  among  those  sent  back  to Athens  (Plut.  Lys. 13.3),  and  Histiaia/Oreos  was  probably given  back  to  the  citizens  expelled  in  446. In  the  Corinthian  War,  the  Oreitans  must  have  been among  the  Euboians  who  fought  against  Sparta  (no. 345)  in the  battle  of  the  Nemea  in  394  (Xen.  Hell. 4.2.17).  In  c. 380 Iason  of  Pherai  had  a  certain  Neogenes  set  up  as  tyrant  of Histiaia/Oreos.  Two  years  later  he  was  deposed  by  a Lakedaimonian  force  (Diod. 15.30.3\u00ad4).  A  Lakedaimonian garrison  was  placed  on  the  acropolis  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.56;Plut. Mor. 773F).  In  377  the  Athenians  ravaged  the  territory  of Histiaia/Oreos  (Diod. 15.30.2,  5)  and  later  in  the  same  year the  Lakedaimonians  were  expelled  from  Oreos  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.57).  Histiaia/Oreos  joined  the  Second  Athenian  Naval League  in  375  or  shortly  after  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.18).  It  left  the League  after  the  battle  of  Leuktra  (Xen.  Hell. 6.5.23),  but joined  once  again  in  357  (IG ii\u00b2  124.16).The  Oreitans  provid- ed  synedroi  for  the  synedrion  and  contributed  a  syntaxis  of 5 tal.  (Aeschin. 3.94,  100).  In  340  some  kind  of  short-lived league  with  a  common  council  was  established  under  the leadership  of  Kallias  of  Chalkis  (Aeschin. 3.89,  94; Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 342);  it  included  Histiaia/Oreos,  Chalkis  (no. 365)  and  Eretria  (no. 370).  Because  of  the  contemporary issue  of  a  common  Euboian  coinage  (supra 643)  the  union  has  sometimes  been  interpreted  as  a  federation (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 342;  Picard  ( 1979)),  but  see  Beck  ( 1997)  28. After  the  Persian  War  Histiaia/Oreos  was  an  oligarchy.  At one  point  a  dispute  between  two  brothers  belonging  to  the gnorimoi  resulted  in  a  stasis  in  which  one  brother  rallied  the wealthy  (euporoi),  the  other  the  commoners  (demotikoi) (Arist.  Pol. 1303b31\u00ad37;  cf.  Gehrke,  Stasis 73).  The  Athenian colony  of 446  or  the  420s  (Mattingly  ( 1996)  246\u00ad48)  was organised  as  a  democracy  (IG i\u00b3  41).After  the  Peloponnesian War  the  constitution  was  an  oligarchy,  which,  in  c. 395,  with- out  any  stasis  or  revolution,  was  changed  into  a  constitution described  by  Aristotle  as  a  politeia  or  a  demokratia  (Pol. 1303a16\u00ad20).  Apart  from  a  short  period  of  tyranny  in 380\u00ad378  under  Neogenes  (Diod. 15.30.3),  the  constitution was  democratic  (Aeschin. 3.103).  In  357  Histiaia/Oreos,  like the  other  the  Euboian  poleis,  was  torn  by  stasis  between  a pro-Theban  and  a  pro-Athenian  faction  (Diod. 16.7.2),  and in  the  340s  Histiaia/Oreos  was  split  between  a  pro- Makedonian  faction,  headed  by  Philistides  and  an  anti-Makedonian  faction,  headed  by  Euphraios,  a  pupil  of Plato  (Trampedach  ( 1994)  96\u00ad97).  The  majority  of  the Oreitan  demos  supported  the  pro-Makedonian  faction,  and Euphraios  was  imprisoned  (Dem. 9.59\u00ad62;  cf.  Ath. 506E, 508D).  In  342  Philip  of  Makedon  succeeded  in  making Philistides  tyrant  of  Histiaia/Oreos  (Dem. 9.33,  18.71; Theopomp.  fr. 387).  But  a  year  later,  on  the  motion  of Demosthenes,  the  Athenians  sent  a  force  against Histiaia/Oreos;  the  city  was  conquered,  Philistides  killed, and  democracy  restored  (Dem. 18.73;  Charax  (FGrHist 103) fr. 19;  schol.  Aeschin. 3.85).  Strabo  reports  that  Philistides during  his  short  reign  had  the  population  of  Ellopia  trans- ferred  to Oreos  ( 10.1.3;  cf.  Moggi,  Sin. 351\u00ad54). The  only  known  public  enactment  of  the  Classical  period is  a  decree  of  the  people  (psephisma  tou  demou)  whereby  the Oreitans  pledged  the  public  revenue  of  Histiaia/Oreos  as security  for  1  tal.,  which  the  polis  owed  to  Demosthenes (Aeschin. 2.104  and 105,  where  the  psephisma  (now  lost)  was read  out  to  the  jurors;  Migeotte  ( 1984)  244\u00ad45).  The  epony- mous  officials w ere  a  board  of  six  archontes  (SEG 29  817.8\u00ad12 (c. 300);  IG xii.9  1187.1\u00ad5  (C 3m)).  A  Histiaian  citizen  is recorded  as  lending  money  at  interest  to  the  city  of  Karystos (no. 373)  (IG xii.97.5\u00ad11).  An  isopoliteia  treaty  was  conclud- ed  between  Histiaia/Oreos  and  Keos  c. 364  (IG xii.5 594  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 287).  Athenian  envoys  were sent  to Histiaia/Oreos  in  357/6  (IG ii\u00b2  124.16)  and  in  341/40 (Aeschin. 3.100).  Histiaia/Oreos  granted  proxenia  to Aeschines  of  Athens  (no. 361)  (Dem. 18.82)  and  to  Kallikles of  Larisa  (no. 401)  (SEG 29  817  (c. 300)),  and  Oreitan  citizens received proxenia  from  Athens  (no. 361)  (IG ii\u00b2  149.10  (c. 375); Knoepfler ( 1995)  324ff). Histiaia/Oreos  possesssed  an  extra-urban  sanctuary  of Artemis  Proseoea  at  Artemision  (Hdt. 7.176.1;Plut.  Them. 8.4;  Lolling  Symposium  1994,forthcoming);  the  cult  includ- ed  Pyrrhic  games  (SEG 33  716,C5f;  IG xii.9  1190;  Ceccarelli ( 1998)  94\u00ad95);  a  cult  of  the  nymph  Histiaia  can  be  inferred from  the  C 4  coins  (infra). The  exact  location  of  the  urban  centre  of  Histiaia  is unknown,  but  it  was  probably  in  the  neighbourhood  of modern  Histiaia  (Xerochori).  After  446  the  urban  centre was  moved  to  Oreos  at  modern  Kastro,  and  the  inhabitants of  the  two  settlements  were  merged  by  an  synoikismos (Strabo  10.1.4;  Moggi,  Sin. 114\u00ad20).  So  far,  only  scanty remains  have  been  found  (ArchDelt 29  ( 1973\u00ad74)  487\u00ad90). We  know  from  literary  sources  that  the  town  had  an  acrop- olis  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.56)  and  a  harbour  (Ps.-Skylax  58).  In  the euboia  657 earthquake  of 426,  700  houses  and  part  of  the  walls  were destroyed  (Demetrios  of  Kallatis  (FGrHist 85)fr.  6),  but  the town  was  fortified again in C 4m  (Dem. 9.61).  The  strong- hold  called  Metropolis  which  was  fortified b y  Chabrias  in 377/6  (Diod. 15.30.2,  5)  may  have  been  the  original  urban centre  of  Histiaia/Oreos,  deserted  after  the  metoikesis  in C 5m;  see  supra 657.  The  prison  of  Oreos  is  mentioned  at Dem. 9.60. In C 4m  Histiaia/Oreos  struck  coins  of  silver  and  bronze on  the  Euboian  standard.

It  seems  better  to obelise  the  MSS  readings  and  to  leave  the  mystery  unsolved. Orobiai  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Thuc. 3.89.2. Orobiai  was  situated  at  modern  Rovies  and  was  famous for  its  oracle  of  Apollo  Selinuntios  (Strabo  10.1.3;  Steph.  Byz. 376.3\u00ad4).At Thuc  3.89.2  Orobiai  is  described  as  a  polis  which was  partly  engulfed  by  the  great  seismic  sea  wave  of 426.We know  from  other  sources  that  a  large  part  of  Histiaia/Oreos (no. 372)  was  destroyed  by  the  same  disaster  (Demetrias  of Kallatis  (FGrHist 85)  fr. 6;  Fossey  ( 1990)  183\u00ad84). An  Attic  inscription  of  c. 430\u00ad410  shows  that  Orobiai  was situated  in  the  territory  of  Histiaia/Oreos  (no. 372)  (IG i\u00b3 418a.6).The  individual  use  of  the  ethnic  '  is  attest- ed  twice  in  a  C 5  inscription  (IG xii.9  923.2\u00ad3;  AE  ( 1963)  5). Histiaia/Oreos  was  organised  into  tribes  and  demes  (supra 656);  but  the  stone  inscribed  with  IG xii.9  923  was  found  in Chalkis  (no. 365),  not  in  the  Histiaia/Oreos  area,  which points  to  the  ethnic  being  a  city-ethnic  rather  than  a  demot- ic.  Knoepfler (by letter) suggests that it may be a pierre errante,  inscribed  by  the  Athenians  settled  in  Histiaia/Oreos. In  Hellenistic  inscriptions  from  the  Histiaia/Oreos  area, however, '  is  attested  again,  and  now  indisputably as  a  demotic  (IG xii.9  1186.3,  1189.27,  37).  Like  Athenai Diades  (no. 364),  Dion  (no. 368),  Poseidion  (no. 376),  and perhaps  some  others  as  well,  Orobiai  may  in  C 5  have  been  a dependent  polis  lying  inside  the  territory  of  Histiaia/Oreos but  transformed  into  a  Histiaian  deme  in  the  course  of  C 4  or C 3  (Hansen  ( 1997)  31,(2000)  209\u00ad10). Some  ancient  remains  have  been  found  in  the  neighbour- hood  of  Palaiochori,  Ag.  Iannako,  but  there  are  a  few  traces only  of  the  ancient  town.  It  was  probably  situated  at  Ag.  Ilias north  of  Rovies  where  some  sherds  of  C 4  have  been  found (Sackett  et al.( 1966)  46\u00ad47,fig.  5). 375.  *Peraia  (Peraeus) Map  55.  Unlocated.  Type:  C.  The toponym * is  not  attested  in  any  source  but  recon- structed  from  the  demotic  (IG xii.9249B.138  (C 3)) and  the  adverbial  form  (IG xii.9249B.445). Peraia  was  a  deme  of  Eretria  (no. 370)  and  is  not  called  a  polis in  any  source,  but  an  analogy  with  Grynchai  (no. 371)  and Styra  (no. 377)  indicates  that  it  was  a  polis  down to  c. 400. The  Eretrian  C 3e  lists  of  citizens  show  that  the  members of  three  of  the  demes,  viz.  Grynchai,  Peraia  and  Styra,  did not  belong  to  one  phyle  but  were  distributed  among  all  the six  phylai  (Knoepfler ( 1997)  396\u00ad403).  The  evidence  for Peraia  is  IG xii.9245A.11  (phyle 1),  246A.6  (phyle 2),  247.2 euboia  659 (phyle 3),  249B.138\u00ad49  (phyle 4).  In  the  case  of  Styra  and Grynchai  the  most  likely  explanation  of  this  anomaly  is  that both  settlements  had  been  poleis  which  were amalgamated with  Eretria  in  C 5l\u00adC4e  and  integrated  into  the  pre-existing organisation  of  Eretrian  citizens  into  six  tribes.  By  analogy, it  seems  reasonable  to infer  that  Peraia  too  was  once  a  polis which  had  been  absorbed  by Eretria  c. 400.  By  contrast  with Grynchai  and  Styra,  however,  Peraia  is  not  recorded  in  the Athenian  tribute  lists  as  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  By letter,  Knoepfler suggests as a possibility that P eraia  be identical  with  the        (no. 367),  attested as  members  of  the  Delian  League. 376.

According  to  Strabo  10.1.5,  Dion  was  situated  at  Cape Kenaion  near  Oreos.  However,  the  urban  centre  has  not  yet been  precisely  located.  Following  Ulrichs  (( 1863)  237,see supra 647),  Geyer  ( 1903)  99  suggested  a  location  at  modern Lichas.  Sapouna-Sakellaraki  ( 1994\u00ad95),  followed  by  Barr., prefers  the  hill  of  Kastri on  the  western  shore  of  the  Kenaion peninsula.  But  Homer  describes  Dion  as  an   (Hom.  Il. 2.538;  cf.  Nonnus,  Dion. 13.161:  ),  and  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  the  Dians are  often  specified as  ~      (IG i\u00b3  279.i.86).  The presumption  is  that  Dion  was  situated  somewhere  on  Mt. Kenaion.  Lichas  would  fit,  but  autopsy  (Reber)  revealed nothing  but  remains  of  the  Byzantine  period.  An  alternative location  is  Khironisi,  whose  position  fits the information given  by  Ptol.  Geog. 3.15.25  (cf.  Reber  ( 2001)  456\u00ad60). Dion  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League,  and  may  have been  among  the  original  members  (ATL  iii. 198\u00ad99).  It belonged  to  the  Island  district  (IG i\u00b3  269.v.25)  and  is  record- ed  in  the  tribute  lists  from  451/50  (IG i\u00b3  262.i.28)  to  432/1  (IG i\u00b3  280.i.80),a  total  of  twelve  times,  once  completely  restored, paying  a  phoros  of 1,000  dr.  in  451/50,  but  in  all  subsequent years 2,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  264.iv.31).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.78).  From  the  Athenian  regulations  for Histiaia/Oreos  (no. 372)  of  C 5s  it  appears  that  Dion  was  a deme  of  Histiaia/Oreos,  but  was  a  separate  circuit  of  juris- diction  (IG i\u00b3  41.100\u00ad2  SEG 32  3;  Koch  ( 1991)  175,  202). Similarly,  Dion  (and  Athenai  Diades  (no. 364))  are  attested as  dependencies  of  Histiaia/Oreos  in  the  last  decade  of  C 5 (IG xii.9  188.18\u00ad19  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 205,  post- 411;  Knoepfler ( 2001)  nn. 338\u00ad39,  post- 404).  Thus,  in  C 5s,  Dion  seems  to have  had  a  double  status  partly  as  a  polis  depending  on Histiaia/Oreos  and  partly  as  a  demos  of  Histiaia/Oreos. Dion  must  have  recovered  its  independence  in  C 4e,  since it  is  recorded  among  the  original  members  of  the  Second Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.88),whereas  the  Histiaians are  recorded  somewhat  later  (B 18).  Dion  may  have  left  the League  together  with  Thebes  (no. 221)  in  371  or  shortly  after- wards  (Dreher  ( 1995)  173).  The  presumption  is  that  Dion was  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  down  to  C 4f.  In Ps.-Skylax 58,  however,  Euboia  is  described  as  a  tetrapolis;  cf.  Dem. 23.213  and  the  treaty  with  Athens  of 357  (IG ii\u00b2  124.15\u00ad16), which  testifies t o  a  total  of  four  poleis  on  Euboia  in  357.The inference  is  that  by C 4m  Dion  had  been  incorporated  into 650 reber,  hansen  and  ducrey Histiaia/Oreos  (no. 372)  (Moggi,  Sin. 290\u00ad92).  In  C 3m  Dion is  attested  as  a  deme  of  Histiaia/Oreos  (IG xii.9  1187.3). 369.Dystos  Map 55.  Lat. 38.20,long.  24.10.  Size  of  territ- ory: 1?  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is  ,  (Theopomp.  fr. 149;  IG xii.988.3,Rom.).Steph.Byz.246.5  suggests  an  ethnic ,  but  inscriptions  invariably  record  the  ablative form  of  the  toponym: ( ) (IG  xii.9191.9;  cf. Knoepfler ( 2001)  357),  mostly  in  an  even  more  abbreviated form:  either  or or (ibid.). Dystos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Theopomp.  fr. 149: \u00b5       \"         '        \".  Since  the  fragment  comes  from  the  four- teenth  book  of  the  Philippika,  the  year  must  be  349/8. Following  Knoepfler ( 1981)  301,  we  believe  that  the  subject  of the  verb  is  probably  Kleitarchos,  the  exiled  political  leader who  with  a  contingent  of  Phokian  mercenaries  and  support- ed  by Eretrian  citizens  attacked  the  tyrant  Ploutarchos,  con- trolled  the  Eretrian  perioikis,  and  attacked  the  polis  of  Dystos. Theopompos'  use  of  the  term  polis  is  open  to three  different interpretations:  ( 1)  Polis  is  used  in  the  sense  of  town  without any  implications  about  the  political  status  of  the  community (thus  Knoepfler ( 1997)  332).  ( 2)  Theopompos  was  misin- formed  and  believed,  erroneously,  that  Dystos  was  a  polis  (a possibility  suggested  by  Hansen  and  Nielsen  ( 2000)  145).  ( 3) Like  Grynchai  (no. 371)  and  Styra  (no. 377),  Dystos  had  once been  a  polis,  but  was  transformed  into  an  Eretrian  deme  in, probably,  C 5f,  and  now  combined  the  status  of  being  an Eretrian  civic  subdivision  with  being  a  kind  of  dependent polis  (thus  Hansen  and  Nielsen  ( 2000)  145\u00ad46;  cf.  Hansen ( 2000)  209\u00ad10).This  view  is  supported  by  the  fact  that  Dystos was  the  dominant,  perhaps  even  the  only  deme  of  the  sixth Eretrian  phyle  (cf.  Knoepfler (1997) 403). The  size  of  the  territory  is  unknown.  At  the  southern  end of  the  valley  of  Dystos  is  a  rock  inscription   (Apostolidis  and  Apostolidis  ( 1990\u00ad91),  and  a boundary  stone  with  the  same  inscription  was  found  at  the foot  of  the  hill  near  the  chapel  of  Ag.  Giorgios  (IG xii.978 (C 5\u00adC4);  Apostolidis  and  Apostolidis  ( 1990\u00ad91)).  Dystos  is attested  as  a  settlement  in  the  prehistoric  period  (Sackett  et al.( 1966)  76  no. 84)  and  was  refounded  in  the  Archaic  peri- od  (Hoepfner  ( 1999)  352).Dystos  may  have  been  a  Dryopian settlement  (Geyer  ( 1903)  111).  In  C 4  it  was  an  Eretrian  deme belonging  to  the  second  district  (Knoepfler ( 1997)  381). The  characteristic  hill  in  the  valley  of  Dystos  accommo- dated  both  the  acropolis  and  the  settlement.  Long  stretches are  preserved  of  a  C 4  defence  circuit  with  interval  towers and  a  gate  in  the  eastern  part.  The  circuit  encloses  an  area  of c. 5  ha.  From  the  gate  a  road  leads  to  a  large  terrace  in  the northern  part  of  the  town where,  probably,  the  agora  was situated.  Many  of  the  houses  are  well  preserved  and  in  some cases  a  second  storey  can  be  traced.  House  K  dates  from  C 6, and  the  more  elaborate  house  J  probably  from  C 4.The acropolis  on  the  top  of  the  hill  was  fortified w ith  a  separate defence  circuit.  Some  foundations  of  buildings  not  yet  exca- vated  may  be  remains  of  sanctuaries.  An  undated  sub- terranean  gallery  was  discovered  in  1998  (BCH 123  ( 1999) 794).  The  cemeteries  lay  at  the  foot  of  the  hill  (Hoepfner ( 1999)).  West  of  the  hill  was  a  lake,  now  drained.  This  lake has  traditionally  been  identified as the lake drained b y Chairephanes  (IG xii.9191  ( 322\u00ad308)),  but  Knoepfler ( 1997) 380\u00ad81  has  pointed  out  that  this  lake  was  situated  near Ptechai,  which  belonged  to  a  different  district  from  that  of Dystos;  cf.  Knoepfler ( 2001)  191\u00ad94. 370.Eretria  (Eretrieus) Map  55.  Lat. 38.25,long.  23.50. Size of  territory: 5.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is  ',  (IG xii.9  196.10,  12  (C 4s);  Hdt. 1.61.2;Lys.  20.14).  The  toponym usually  denotes  the  urban  centre  (Ps.-Skylax  58)  but  some- times  the  city  plus  hinterland the  territory  of  Eretria  (IG xii.9197.12\u00ad14  (C 4);  cf.  Knoepfler ( 2001)  53).The  city-ethnic is '  (IvO 248  (C 5e);  ML  27.8  ( 479);  IG xii.9  188.17 (c. 400);  Xen.  An. 7.8.8;  Arist.  Pol. 1289b39).  Variant  forms  of the  city-ethnic  are  '  or '  or '.But they are found only in late lexicographers and  have  no  authority  (Steph.  Byz. 276.8\u00ad9;  Etym.  Magn. 371.7;  Phot.  Lex.). Eretria  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (IG xii.9 196.10\u00ad11;  Thuc. 8.95.3,  6;Dem.  9.57;  Ps.-Skylax 58)  and  in the  political  sense  (IG xii.9  187.9  (c. 410);  IG ii\u00b2  16.B.2 ( 394/3);  Knoepfler ( 2001)  1.6\u00ad7  (C 4s),  3.7  ( 330\u00ad320);  Hdt. 6.106.2;Aeschin.3.94).In  an  inscription  of  C 6s,polis  denotes the  urban  centre  rather  than  the  acropolis  (SEG 41 725B  Nomima i91;  cf.  Flensted-Jensen  et al.( 2000)  165). The  community  is  described  as  patris  in  one  of  Plato's  epi- grams  (AG 7256  Diehl  fr. 10,  but  perhaps  spurious)  and the  town  as  an  asty  (Thuc. 8.95.4).  The  collective  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  Eretrian  citizenship  and proxeny  decrees  (Knoepfler ( 2001)  1.10\u00ad11;  IG xii.9  187B.12 (C 4f),  195.5  (C 4s))  and  externally  in  a  C 5e  dedication  in Olympia  (IvO 248)  and  on  the  Serpent  Column  (ML  27.8). The  individual  and  external  use  is  attested  in  a  casualty  list  of 424/3(?)  from  Tanagra  (IG vii  585.i.16\u00ad17),  in  a  Delphic list  of  tamiai  of 337/6  (CID ii  74.47),  and  in  a  C 4m  list  of proxenoi  of  Karthaia  (no. 492)  (IG xii.5542a8). euboia  651 The  territory  of  Eretria  is  called  '  (Thuc. 8.60.1,8.95.6)  or  '   (Hdt. 6.101.1;  cf.  Pl.  Leg. 698D).  In  C 4m  it  covered  c. 1500  km \u00b2  and  was  subdivided into  five districts (Knoepfler  ( 1997)  371\u00ad73,  map  on  402), called (IG xii.9189.24\u00ad25;  Knoepfler ( 1997)  376).  To date,  only  one  district  is  known  by  name:  viz.  (IG xii.9241.37;  Knoepfler ( 1997)  375\u00ad77).  Each  district  was further  subdivided  into  a  number  of  territorial  demes  (IG xii.9241;  Wallace  ( 1947)  119\u00ad24;  Knoepfler ( 1997)  371),  actu- ally  called  \u00b5  (SEG 41  723;  Knoepfler ( 1997)  374)  and  each headed  by  a  demarch  ( \u00b5,  IG xii.9189.23\u00ad24). There  were  altogether  some  fifty-five  to  sixty  demes (Knoepfler ( 1997)  358),  of  which  more  than  fifty are attested in  the  preserved  inscriptions  (Jones,  POAG 75\u00ad76  with  corri- genda  in  Knoepfler ( 1997)  355\u00ad58).  Some  of  the  demes  were former  poleis  which  had  been  incorporated  into  Eretria  and reduced  to the  status  of  demoi.  Such  were  Styra  (no. 377), possibly,  Grynchai  (no. 371)  and  Dystos  (no. 369)  and,  per- haps,  Peraia  (no. 375). The  Eretrian  citizen  body  was  subdivided  into,  probably, six  tribes  (Knoepfler ( 1997)  390\u00ad92),  called  phylai  (SEG 45 1141).  Two  of  them  are  known  by  name:  viz. (IG xii  suppl. 548.4\u00ad5  Nomima i39  (C 5e))  and   (REG 108  ( 1995)  p.  xxxix).  A  third  was  probably  called (Strabo  10.1.10;  Knoepfler ( 1997)  393).  They  were named  after  local  heroes  and  were  thus  different  from  the  six old  Ionian  phylai  (Knoepfler ( 1997)  392\u00ad93).  Each  phyle  was composed  of  a  number  of  demes  drawn  from  all  five choroi. Thus,  one  phyle  comprised  all  citizens  from  twelve  demes plus  some  citizens  from  the  demes  of  Grynchai,  Pereia  and Styra  whose  members  were  divided  between  all  six  Eretrian phylai  (IG xii.9245  and  Suppl. 555;Knoepfler ( 1997)  393\u00ad400). Whereas  the  organisation  into  phylai  must  go  back  to c. 500  or earlier,  the  subdivision  into  five districts m ust  have  been introduced  some  time  in  C 4f(Knoepfler ( 1997)  392). According  to  Strabo  10.1.10,  Eretrias'  military  strength was  recorded  on  an  ancient  stele  set  up  in  the  sanctuary  of Artemis  Amarysia.  The  figures he r eports  are  3,000  hoplites, 600  hippeis  and 60  chariots.  For  the  andrapodismos  of 490, see  infra.  In  C 4l  Eretria  had  some  6,000  adult  male  citizens, as  can  be  inferred  retrospectively  from  a  cluster  of  lists  of names  of  c. 280  (Knoepfler ( 1997)  395).  (a)  From  a  fragmen- tary  list  of  ephebes  organised  into  the  five districts ( IG xii.9 241  Wallace  ( 1947)  120  (C 4l\u00adC3e))  it  can  be  inferred  that  a year  class  of  ephebes  numbered  some  150\u00ad200  young Eretrians,  both  hoplites  and  psiloi  (cf.  Knoepfler ( 1997)  404). (b)  Some  large  lists  of  names  with  patronymics  and demotics  are  probably  a  roster  of  Eretrians  organised  into their  phylai  (I:  IG xii.9245;  II:  IG xii.9246;  iii:  IG xii.9247 252 unpublished  fragment  (Knoepfler ( 1997)  397);  IV: unpublished  fragment  (Knoepfler ( 1997)  n. 318);  V\u00adVI:  no lists  preserved));  see  Knoepfler ( 1997)  395\u00ad400.  IG xii.9245 is  almost  complete  and  has  869  names  preserved,  plus  about sixty  names  now  lost a  total  of 930  names.  On  the  assump- tion  that  there  were  six  phylai  of  equal  size,  c. 5,500  Eretrians were  recorded  on  the  lists.  A  year  class  of 150\u00ad200  ephebes corresponds  to a  force  of  some  4,200\u00ad5,000  citizens  of  milit- ary  age  ( 18\u00ad59)  and  fit for military service,  and  to  a  total adult  male  citizen  population  of  c. 5,750\u00ad6,850  minimum, including  those  over  60  and  those  unfit for military service (Hansen  ( 1985)  12).  Since  the  army  seems  to  have  been organised  in  accordance  with  the  five districts,  the  presump- tion  is  that  the  lists  organised  into  phylai  were  a  roster  of  all adult  male  Eretrian  citizens. Next  to  nothing  is  known  about  the  history  of  Eretria before  c. 500.  Apart  from  colonisation  (infra),  the  only  event reported  in  the  sources  is  the  semi-mythical  Lelantine  War, fought  in  C 8s  or  in  C 7f  (Plut.  Mor. 868E;  Parker  ( 1997)) between  Eretria  and  Chalkis  (no. 365)  and  their  allies  over the  possession  of  the  Lelantine  Plain  (Thuc. 1.15.3;  Hdt. 5.99.1;Strabo 10.1.12;  Hes.  Op. 654  and  Plut.  Mor. 153F, 760E\u00ad761A;  cf.  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 102).  In  499 ", "Chalkis": "Identifier: 368. , (Chalkideus) Map  55.  Lat. 38.25,long.  23.35. Size of  territory: 5.

In order  to distinguish  Euboian  Chalkis  from  homonymous cities,  it  is  sometimes  called     (Aen. Tact. 4.1).According  to  Hecat.  fr. 129  the  toponym  was  origi- nally  ,  perhaps  to  be  identified w ith  modern Lefkandi  (Bakhuizen  ( 1985)  96).  The  city-ethnic  is (Aeschin. 3.89;  CEG 179.3  (c. 505)),  sometimes further  specified:     '   (IG xii.6 42.15  (C 4l))  or         (Xen.  Hell. 4.2.17). Chalkis  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  political  sense  (IG i\u00b3  40.5; IG ii\u00b2  44.14;  Philiskos  fr. 3,  CGF)  and  in  the  urban  sense (Hecat.  fr. 129;Eur.  Iph.  Aul. 168;Aen.Tact.  4.1;  Ps.-Skylax 58).  The  collective  use  of  the  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  inter- nally  in  abbreviated  form  on  C 6\u00adC5  coins  (infra)  and  exter- nally  in  inscriptions  (CEG 179.3;  IG i\u00b3  40.5,21)  and  in  literary sources  (Hdt. 5.99;  Arist.  Pol. 1289b39).  The  individual  and external  use  is  attested  in  inscriptions  (CID ii  31.79  ( 345/4)) and  in  literary  sources  (Aeschin. 3.89). The  territory  of  Chalkis  is  called  (Arist.  Hist.  an. 496b25\u00ad26).  To  the  south Chalkis  bordered  on  Eretria  (no. 370),  and  according  to Bakhuizen  ( 1985)  127\u00ad31  the  frontier  followed  the  mountain euboia  647 ridge  of  Voudochi,  Olympos,  Xirovouni  and  Skoteini,  end- ing  at  modern  Kimi.  According  to Knoepfler,  however,  it  ran east  of  the  river  Lelantos,  and  the  territory of  Chalkis  includ- ed  Argoura,  now  located  south  of  the  river  (Knoepfler ( 1997) 353;  cf.  ( 1981)).  To the  north  Chalkis  bordered  on Histiaia/Oreos  (no. 372).  The  frontier  was  at  Mts.  Kandili and  Pyxaria  (Bakhuizen  ( 1985)  127\u00ad31),  but,  at  least  in  the Archaic  period,  the  territory  included  Kerinthos  north  of Pyxaria  (Thgn. 891\u00ad94;  Gehrke  ( 1994)  336\u00ad39;  Knoepfler ( 1997)  352\u00ad53  with  n. 10)  but  not  Elymnion  (Gehrke ( 1994) 339\u00ad40;  Knoepfler ( 1997)  418  with  n. 102).  In  C 4  it  covered c. 825  km \u00b2. Part  of  Euboia  was  called  (Etym.  Magn. 268.3; schol.  Lycoph.  Alex. 374),  presumably  to  be  located  in Chalkidian  territory north-east  of  Chalkis  (Geyer  ( 1903)  45; Knoepfler ( 1997)  376  with  n. 194).  This  region  seems,  at  least in  C 5,  to  have  been  the  home  of  two  different  communities, which,  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists,  are  recorded  separately from  the  ~  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.71),  sc.  the ~    (no. 367;  IG i\u00b3  71.i.83\u00ad84)  and  the      (no. 366)  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.93\u00ad94);  see  infra  650. Like  most  other  Euboian  poleis,  Chalkis  was  subdivided into  demoi,  of  which  only  one  is  attested:  a  Delphian  decree of  c. 315\u00ad285  (F.Delphes iii.1424.1\u00ad2)  bestows  proxeny  on [Kl]eochares  of  Chalkis  of  the  deme  of  Aigai,  ( \u00b5 [ ],  a restoration  of .;  cf.  Strabo  8.7.4, 9.2.13;  see  Jones,  POAG 73;  Knoepfler ( 1997)  406  n. 11). Next  to  nothing  is  known  about  the  history  of  Chalkis before  506.  Apart  from  colonisation  (infra 649),  the  only event  reported  in  the  sources  is  the  semi-mythical  Lelantine War,  fought  in  C 8s  or  C 7f  between  Eretria  (no. 370)  and Chalkis  and  their  allies  over  the  possession  of  the  Lelantine Plain  (Parker  ( 1997);  infra 652).  In  506  the  Chalkidians joined  the  Peloponnesians  and  the  Boiotians  in  an  abortive attack  on  Athens  (no. 361)  (Hdt. 5.74.2).  The  Athenians  then invaded  Euboia  and  inflicted a defeat on the Chalkidians; they  confiscated the land belonging t o  the  hippobotai  and gave it  to 4,000  klerouchs  (Hdt. 5.77;  CEG 179).  In  480  the Athenians  handed  over  twenty  hulls  of  triremes  to  the Chalkidians  on  which  they  fought  in  the  battles  of Artemision  (Hdt. 8.1.2)  and  Salamis  (Hdt. 8.46.2).  They  are recorded  on  the  Serpent  Column  (ML  27.8).  Chalkis  was  a member  of  the  Delian  League,  and  may  have  been  among the  original  members  (ATL  iii. 198\u00ad99).  It  belonged  to  the Island  district  (IG i\u00b3  269.v.31)  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute lists  from  448/7  (IG i\u00b3  264.iv.23)  to  416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.31, partly  restored),  a  total  of  eleven  times,  three  times  com- pletely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 5  tal.  in  448/7  (IG i\u00b3 264.iv.23),  reduced  (sic)  to  3  tal.  after  the  revolt  of 446  (IG i\u00b3 270.v.32  ( 442/1)).  It  was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3 71.i.71,  10  tal.),  and  in  413  Chalkis  was  still  listed  among  the paying  members  (Thuc. 7.57.4).  In  446  Chalkis  defected from  Athens;  but  the  revolt  was  quenched  by an  Athenian army  under  Perikles  (Thuc. 1.114.1\u00ad3;Plut.Per.23.4).Chalkis may  have  defected  once  again  in  424/3  together  with  other Euboian  poleis  (Philoch.  fr. 130).  The  treaty  between  Athens and  Chalkis  (IG i\u00b3  40)  by  which  Chalkis  was  brought  back into  the  League  may  belong  in  either  year.  It  is  dated  to  446/5 in  IG i\u00b3  but  to 424/3  by  Mattingly  ( 1996)  53\u00ad67,  161\u00ad62, 372\u00ad77,  391\u00ad94.  The  treaty  prescribed  that  the  Chalkidians swear  loyalty  towards  Athens  ( 21\u00ad23)  and  give  hostages  ( 47); moreover,  their  self-government  in  administration  of  jus- tice  was  restricted  in  matters  punishable  by  death,  exile  or loss  of  rights  ( 74\u00ad76);  cf.  Balcer  ( 1978).  Chalkis  was  still  loyal to  Athens  in  411  (Thuc. 8.95.6)  but  defected  after  the Athenian  defeat  at  Eretria  (Thuc. 8.95.7;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 33.1; Diod. 13.47.3).  During  the  rule  of  the  Thirty,  many  Athenian democrats  fled t o  Chalkis  (Lys. 24.25). Chalkis  was  among  the  original  members  of  the  Second Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.80;Diod.  15.30.1),  and  a treaty  between  Athens  and  Chalkis  was  concluded  in  378/7 (IG ii\u00b2  44).  But  together  with  Thebes  (no. 221)  and  the  other Euboian  poleis,  Chalkis  left  the  League  in  371  (Xen.  Hell. 6.5.23;  Dreher  ( 1995)  173)  and  fought  against  the  Athenians  at Mantinea  in  362  (Diod. 15.85.2,  6).  In  357,  Chalkis  was  torn  by stasis  between  a  pro-Theban  and  a  pro-Athenian  faction (Aeschin. 3.85\u00ad86;Diod.  16.7.2),  and  was  presumably  con- quered  by  exiles  operating  from  Eretria  (Aen.  Tact. 4.1\u00ad4). Both  the  Thebans  and  the  Athenians  invaded  Euboia;  the Thebans  were  expelled  from  Euboia  (Dem. 22.14);  a  new treaty  was  concluded,  and  Chalkis  rejoined  the  Naval  League (IG ii\u00b2  124.16,  147;  Aeschin. 3.85).  In  349/8  an  Athenian  army under  Phokion  was  sent  to  assist  Ploutarchos  of  Eretria.  It landed  at  Argoura  on  Chalkidian  territory (Dem. 21.132)  and was  opposed  by  an  Euboian  army  under  Kallias  of  Chalkis (Aeschin. 3.86\u00ad87).  Phokion  won  the  battle  of  Tamynai (Aeschin. 2.169\u00ad70;Plut.Phoc.12\u00ad13),a  peace  was  concluded, and  Chalkis  rejoined  the  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  125;  Aeschin. 2.12,3.88).In  340  some  kind  of  short-lived  league  with  a  com- mon  council  was  established  under  the  leadership  of  Kallias of  Chalkis  (Aeschin. 3.89,  94;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 342);  it  included Chalkis,  Eretria  (no. 370)  and  Histiaia/Oreos  (no. 372). Because  of  the  contemporary  issue  of  a  common  Euboian coinage  (supra 643;  infra)  the  union  has  sometimes  been interpreted  as  a  federation  (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 342;  Picard ( 1979)),  but  see  Beck  ( 1997)  28. 648 reber,  hansen  and  ducrey The  constitution  of  Chalkis  (Gehrke,  Stasis 37\u00ad41)  was among  the  158  politeiai  described  by  Aristotle  and  his  pupils (frr. 618\u00ad20).  In  the  Archaic  period  oligarchy  alternated  with tyranny  (Arist.  Pol. 1316a31\u00ad32;  Hes.  Op. 654\u00ad57),  and  in  one case  a  tyranny  may  even  have  been  followed  by  what  Aristotle classifies as a democracy (Arist.  Pol. 1304a29\u00ad31;see Aubonnet  ad  loc.  and  LGPN i  s.v. ).In C6l Chalkis was an  oligarchy  governed  by a  class  of  hippobotai  (Arist.  Pol. 1289b36\u00ad39;  Hdt. 77.2),  in  another  context  described  as  an aristocracy  based  on  a  census  requirement  (Arist.  fr. 618). After  the  Athenian  victory  in  506,  the  hippobotai  were expelled,  and  their  property  handed  over  to  4,000  Athenian klerouchs  (Hdt. 5.77.2).  A  brief  democratic  interlude  may have  followed  (Thgn. 893\u00ad94);  but  the  hippobotai  returned when  the  Athenian  klerouchs  were  withdrawn  in  490  in  con- nection  with  the  Persian  invasion  of  Euboia  (Hdt. 6.100), and  they  were  still  in  power  when  Perikles  invaded  Euboia  in 446  (Plut.  Per. 23.4).  After  the  surrender  of  Chalkis,  the  hip- pobotai's  property  was  confiscated,  divided  into  2,000  kleroi and  given  to,  probably,  the  other  Chalkidians  and  some  for- eigners  (Ael.  VH 6.1).  It  is  unlikely  that  the  Athenians  sent klerouchs  to  Chalkis  as  they  did  to  Histiaia/Oreos  (no. 372) (Figueira  ( 1991)  256\u00ad60).  There  is  no  direct  evidence,  but  the ensuing  treaty  between  Athens  and  Chalkis  (IG i\u00b3  40)  indi- cates  that  from  now  on  Chalkis  had  a  democratic  constitu- tion  (Gehrke,  Stasis 40).  In  357  there  may  have  been  an outbreak  of  stasis  in  Chalkis  as  there  was  in  the  other Euboian  poleis  (Diod. 16.7.2).  In  the  340s  Chalkis  was  ruled by  Mnesarchos  and  his  sons,  Taurosthenes  and,  especially, Kallias.  They  were  probably  democratic  leaders,  and  there  is no  reason  to  trust  Aischines'  allegation  that  they  were  tyrants ( 3.89,  92).  Both  obtained  Athenian  citizenship  (Hyp. 1.20; Din 1.44),  probably  in  341/40  (Osborne  ( 1983)  T  73). Together  with  the  other  Euboian  poleis,  Chalkis  was  a member  of  the  Amphictyonic  League  (Lef\u00e8vre ( 1998)  59\u00ad63) and  provided  in  some  years  one  of  the  two  Ionian  hierom- nemones  (CID ii  32.44;  74.i.34\u00ad35).  Athenian  envoys  were sent  to Chalkis  (IG ii\u00b2  124.16),  and  Chalkidian  envoys  were sent  to Athens  (IG i\u00b3  40.12\u00ad17;  IG ii\u00b2  44.8;  Aeschin. 3.91). No  public  enactment  antedating  the  Hellenistic  period  is preserved  and  the  only  attested  political  institution  is  a  boule referred  to  as  a  decision-making  institution  in  446/5  (IG i\u00b3 40.62\u00ad63). The  only  cults  attested  in  classical  sources  are  those  of Zeus  Olympios  (IG i\u00b3  40.35,61\u00ad62)  and  Athena  (IG ii\u00b2  44.17). Two  Chalkidian  citizens  are  attested  as  victors  in  the Olympic  Games  (Olympionikai 121  in 532  and 459  in 332)  and one  in  the  Pythian  games  (Plin.  HN 35.35  (C 5)).  In  C 4m Chalkis  was  a  walled  city  with  an  agora  (Aen.  Tact. 4.1\u00ad4;  cf. Strabo  10.1.8  (r 334))  and,  in  the  agora,  a  funeral  monument of  C 6?  set  over  Kleomachos  of  Pharsalos  (Plut.  Mor. 761A; Bakhuizen  ( 1985)  24\u00ad25).  The  acropolis  was  at  Mt. Vathrovo\u00fania  in  the  south-east  part  of  the  city.  The  acropo- lis  and  part  of  the  city  as  well  were  protected  by  a  C 4e  circuit wall  of  c. 2  km  enclosing  an  area  of  c. 12.5  ha.  In  411  the  town of  Chalkis  was  connected  with  the  mainland  by  a  bridge, and  in  334  a  fortress  was  erected  on  a  hill  immediately  west of  the  bridge  near  Aulis  (Diod. 13.47.3\u00ad6;Strabo 10.1.8; Bakhuizen  ( 1985)  48\u00ad52).  The  harbour  is  mentioned  at  Ps.- Skylax 58;  cf.  Thuc. 8.95.6.  At  Chalkis  there  are  a  number  of natural  harbours,  but  no  ancient  remains  have  been  found (Bakhuizen  ( 1985)  54\u00ad57).  A  rock  on  the  Kallimani  hill  is inscribed  : ,  probably  a  boundary  mark  of  C 4e (ArchDelt 31  ( 1976)  147). Chalkis  struck  silver  coins  c. 550\u00ad506,c.490\u00ad465,  and  coins of  silver  and  bronze  c. 337\u00ad308.  Coins  were struck  first on the Euboic  standard  (tridrachm,  drachm,  hemidrachm),  later on  the  Attic  standard  (tetradrachm,  didrachm  and tetrobol).  ( 1)  Silver  C 6:  obv.  facing  quadriga  (tridrachm)  or facing  horseman  and  horse  (drachm)  or  facing  horseman (hemidrachm);  rev.  incuse  of  mill-sail  pattern.

( 4)  Silver  (drachm,  hemidrachm,  obol, hemiobol)  and  bronze  337\u00ad308;  obv.  head  of  the  nymph Chalkis  (silver)  or  bust  of  Hera (bronze);  rev.  eagle  carrying a  snake.

Chalkis  was  involved  in  the  colonisation  of  Naxos  (no. 41),  Zankle  (no. 51),  Kyme  (no. 57),  Neapolis  (no. 63), Pithekoussai  (no. 65),  Rhegion  (no. 68),  Kleonai  (no. 580) and  possibly  Skiathos  (no. 520).  Furthermore,  on  the  basis primarily  of  onomastic  similarity,  Chalkis  is  often  assumed to  have  been  heavily  involved  in  the  colonisation  of  the Chalkidic  peninsula;  see  further  Flensted-Jensen  ( 1998) 57\u00ad70  with  refs.  and  ( 2000)  125\u00ad31  with  refs. 366.

Alex. 374)  denotes  the  Euboian  mountain  district north-east  of  Chalkis  (no. 365)  (Bakhuizen  ( 1985)  141  n. 49). This  region  was  inhabited  by  the  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.94; Lycoph.  Alex. 375)  and  the  ~  (no. 367)  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.83; see  supra 643). The       were  members  of  the  Delian League.  They  belonged  to  the  Island  district  (IG i\u00b3 71.i.93\u00ad94)  and  are  recorded  twice  in  the  tribute  lists,  in 429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.iii.24)  and  in  417/16  (IG i\u00b3  288.i.2\u00ad3),in  both cases  heavily  but  plausibly  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1  tal. and 2,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  282.iii.24).  They  were  assessed  for  trib- ute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.94:  1  tal., 2,000  dr.). Membership  of  the  Delian  League  indicates  that  the Diakrioi  constituted  a  self-governing  political  community, but  there  is  no  indication  that  it  was  centred  on  a  nucleated settlement.  For  the  possible  identification of  the  Diakrioi  en Euboia  with  the  Eretrian  deme  of  Peraia,  see  no. 375. 367.  Diakres  apo  Chalkideon Map 55.  Unlocated.  Type: [A].  On  Diakria,  see  no. 366.  The  Athenian  assessment decree  of 425/4  records  both  the  ~   (IG i\u00b3  71.i.83\u00ad84)  and  the        (no. 366) (IG i\u00b3  71.i.93\u00ad94).  The  Diakres  must  accordingly  have  been different  from  the  Diakrioi,  and  formed  perhaps  a  short- lived  splinter  community  of  Chalkis  (no. 365)  settled  in  the Diakria  in  the  northern  part  of  the  territory  of  Chalkis  in  the years  after  446  when  Chalkis  was  controlled  by  Athens  (no. 361)  (Geyer  ( 1924)  224).The  Diakres  are  recorded  in  the  trib- ute  lists  from  434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.25\u00ad26)  to  416/15  (IG i\u00b3 289.i.15\u00ad16),  a  total  of  six  times,  twice  completely  restored, paying  a  phoros  of  first  800  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.25)  but  3,000  dr. in 416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.15\u00ad16).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.83\u00ad84:  2,000  dr.).  In  434/3  the  Diakres appear  as  the  fourth  of  thirteen  communities  listed  under the  heading  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.18  and 25\u00ad26). Membership  of  the  Delian  League  indicates  that  the Diakres  constituted  a  self-governing  political  community, but  there  is  no  indication  that  it  was  centred  on  a  nucleated settlement. 368.

Byz.  lists as  an  alternative  toponym  ( 362.14);  yet  another alternative  toponym  is  (Steph.  Byz. 363.1;  schol.  Ap. Rhod. 1.1165).  The  city-ethnic  is  (Hdt. 4.33.2; Thuc. 1.98.3;Ar.  Lys. 1059;  IG xii.97.20  (C 4f)).  Karystos  is called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Ps.-Skylax  58: ,  where  the  political  sense  may  be  a  connota- tion)  and  in  the  political  sense  (IG xii.912.1  ArchDelt 26 ( 1971)  Chron. 262  no. 13  (C 5\u00adC4);  IG ii\u00b2  12.11\u00ad12;  Hdt. 4.33.2, where  the  urban  sense  may  be  a  connotation).  The  collective use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  inscriptions (IG xii.97.20  (C 4f))  and  in  abbreviated  form  on  C 6\u00adC4 coins  (infra),  and  externally  in  inscriptions  (I.D\u00e9los 98B.10 ( 377\u00ad373))  as  well  as  in  literary  sources  (Hdt. 6.99.2;  Thuc. 4.42.1).The  individual  and  external  use  is  attested  in  inscrip- tions  (CID ii  4.iii.9  (C 4f))  as  well  as  in  literary  sources  (Hdt. 7.214.1;Dem.  35.8\u00ad10).  Patris  is  restored  in  IG ii\u00b2  467.21 ( 306/5). The  territory is  called     (Hdt. 9.105)  or (Theophr.  Hist.  pl. 8.4.4).  In  C 4  it  bordered  on that  of  Styra  (no. 377),  then  an  Eretrian  deme  (infra 660), and  comprised  the  southern  part  of  Euboia,  altogether  some 450  km \u00b2.  The  principal  site  in  the  territory  of  Karystos  is  the harbour  of  Geraistos  with  a  sanctuary  of  Poseidon  (Ps.- Skylax 58;Arr.  Anab. 2.1.2;  Schumacher  ( 1993)  77\u00ad80).  The only  other  known  Archaic  and  Classical  settlements  are Kyrnos  (Hdt. 9.105)  and  Marmarion  (Strabo  10.1.6),  which may  have  existed  in  C 4  (Knoepfler b y  letter),  and  the archaeological  sites  at  Arkhampolis  (Barr. 55,C,  supra 646) and  Philagra  (Barr. 55,C,  supra 646\u00ad47). Coins  of  C 6m  (infra)  and  a  Panhellenic  victor  of  C 6s (infra)  are  the  only  evidence  we have for  Karystos  before  the Persian  War.  In  490  the  Persian  forces  laid  siege  to  Karystos, ravaged  its  territory  and  forced  the  Karystians  to  surrender (Hdt. 6.99.2).  In  480  the  Karystians  joined  the  Persian  army (Hdt. 8.66.2),  and  after  Salamis  they  were  forced  by Themistokles  to  pay  an  indemnity  (Hdt. 8.112.2)  and  had their  territory  ravaged  by  the  Greek  army  (Hdt. 8.121.1). Nevertheless,  the  Karystians  dedicated  a  bronze  bull  in Delphi  from  spoils  taken  in  the  Persian  War  (Paus. 10.16.6). In  a  war  between  Athens  and  Karystos  c. 476\u00ad469  (Thuc. 1.98.3;Brock ( 1996)  359),  the  Karystians  were  defeated  in  a battle  at  Kyrnos  (Hdt. 9.105)  and  forced  to  join  the  Delian League.  Karystos  belonged  to  the  Island  district  (IG i\u00b3 270.v.21)  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3 259.ii.16)  to  416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.22),  a  total  of  eleven  times, once  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 12  tal.  in  454/3, reduced to 7\u0153  tal.  in  451/50  (IG i\u00b3  262.i.23),  and  further reduced to 5  tal.  in  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.26).  It  was  assessed for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.70:  5  tal.)  and  in  410/9  (IG i\u00b3 100.i.4).  In  spite  of  Thuc. 1.114.2,  the  silence  of  our  sources indicates  that  Karystos  did  not  join  the  other  Euboian  poleis in  defecting  from  the  Delian  League  in  446.  But,  in  addition to  the  reduction  in  phoros,  there  is  some  archaeological evidence  to support  the  view  that  one  of  the  C 5m  Athenian klerouchies  on  Euboia  (Diod. 11.88.5;  Paus. 1.27.3;  schol.  Ar. Nu. 213)  was  placed  in  Karystos  (Figueira  ( 1991)  225,y;  Brock ( 1996)  365\u00ad66;  Salomon  ( 1997)  209).  In  413  Karystos  was  still listed  among  the  paying  members  (Thuc. 7.57.4).  The  con- stitution  of  Karystos  seems  to  have  been  changed  into  an  oli- garchy  in  consequence  of  the  revolution  in  Athens  in  411 (Thuc. 8.64.1,  65.1,  69.3;  cf.  Gehrke,  Stasis 76). Karystos  was  among  the  original  members  of  the  Second Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.84),  but  probably  left  the League  together  with  Thebes  (no. 221)  in  371  or  shortly  after- wards  (Xen.  Hell. 6.5.23;  Dreher  ( 1995)  173).  In  357  Karystos, like  the  other  Euboian  poleis,  was  torn  by  stasis  between  a pro-Theban  and  a  pro-Athenian  faction  (Diod. 16.7.2),  and when  the  Thebans  had  been  expelled  from  Euboia  by  the Athenians,  a  new  treaty  was  concluded  between  Athens  (no. 361)  and  Karystos  (IG ii\u00b2  124;  cf.  SEG 45  54).  It  is  not  known whether  Karystos  in  the  340s  was  a  member  of  the  ephemer- al  Euboian  league  or  federation.  In  323/2  Karystos  was  the only  Euboian  polis  to  support  Athens  in  the  Lamian  War 658 reber,  hansen  and  ducrey (Diod. 18.11.2;  Paus. 1.25.4). In C 4  Karystos  had  close  relations  with  Histiaia/Oreos (no. 372)  and  Thebes  (no. 221),  and  had  taken  up  some  loans from  citizens  of  these  two  poleis.  Payments  on  these  loans are  attested  in  an  inscription  of  c. 370  (IG xii.97  Migeotte ( 1984)  no. 73)  which  shows  that  the  eponymous  official in Karystos  was  an  archon  and  that  there  was  a  board  of  tamiai. An  undated  (C 4\u00adC3?)  public  enactment  mentions  a  board of  strategoi  and,  probably,  a popular  assembly  (IG xii.91).  A citizen  of  Karystos  was  granted  proxenia  by Eretria  (no. 370) in  C 4l  (IG xii.9211;  cf.  Knoepfler ( 2001)  212).  During  the grain  crisis  of 330\u00ad326  Karystos  obtained  15,000  medimnoi from  Kyrene  (no. 1028)  (SEG ix  2  Tod 196.21;  cf.  SEG 38 1880).  Karystos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  amphiktyony (Hdt. 4.33.2;  I.D\u00e9los 98.120  ( 377\u00ad373))  and  had  a  treasury  on Delos  (IG xi.2144.A.88). In  the  Archaic  period  the  urban  centre  was  situated  on  the Plakari  hill  (Keller  ( 1985)  200\u00ad1),  and  it  may  have  remained there  during  C 5.  In  C 4,  if  not  before,  it  was  moved  to Palaiochori.  From  the  siege  of  Karystos  in  490  it  can  be inferred  that  the  city  was  fortified (Hdt. 6.99.2).There  are  few remains.  There  was  a  fortified acropolis (Livy  32.17)  on  the Montofoli  hill  (Keller  ( 1985)  218),  and  a  large  cemetery  to  the south.  A  temple  of  Dionysos  is  attested  (Keller  ( 1985)  217). Karystos  had  one  citizen  who  distinguished  himself  in  all the  four  major  Panhellenic  games:  viz.  Glaukos  the  pugilist (Simon.  fr. 4,  PMG;Dem. 18.319)  who  in  520  won  one  victo- ry  in  the  Olympic  Games  (Olympionikai 134),  and  then  two in  the  Pythian,  eight  in  the  Nemean,  and  eight  in  the Isthmian  Games  (Paus. 6.10.1\u00ad3). Karystos  struck  coins  of  silver  c. 550\u00ad445  and  of  silver  and bronze  c. 411\u00ad336  (the  chronology  is  based  on  the  traditional date  of  the  Athenian  Coinage  Decree  and  on  the  belief  that Greek  poleis  stopped  minting  coins  during  the  Makedonian supremacy).

Type:  A: .The toponym is , (Hecat. fr. 55;  Thuc. 1.13.6)  and  the  city-ethnic (Dem. 32.8;  Arist.  fr. 560).  In  the  Ionic dialect  they  are,  respectively, (Hdt. 5.9.15)  and (LSAG 288  no. 2  (C 5f)). Massalia  is  called  a  polis  Hellenis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skylax 4  (cf.  Ps.-Skymnos  209,  perhaps  drawing  on Timaios  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 71,  though  probably  not  for  the term polis).  It is  called  polis  in  the  political  sense  by  Arist.  Pol. 1305b4\u00ad5;  politikos  is  used  about  the  constitution  at  Arist. Pol. 1305b10,  and  politeuma  is  found  at  Pol. 1321a30\u00ad31;  there was  an  Aristotelian  Massalioton  politeia  (Arist.  fr. 560),  and Dem. 32.8  refers  to the  politai. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  C 5m  coins  (Brenot  ( 1992))  and  externally  in  Dem. 32.8\u00ad9 and  Arist.  fr. 560.  The  earliest  examples  of  the  external  indi- vidual  use  are  LSAG 288  no. 2  (C 5f)  and  IG xiv  295  (C 4f);  see further  Robert  ( 1968)  and  Manganaro  ( 1992)). There  are  two  different  traditions  about  the  foundation of  Massalia,  and  consequently  two  different  dates  for  the foundation.  One  tradition  places  the  foundation  in  600 (Timaios  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 7  120  years  before  the  battle  of Salamis),  while  the  other  places  it  at  the  time  of  the  fall  of Phokaia  (no. 859)  to  the  Persians  in  546  (Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 8;Isoc.  Archidamus 84).  The  archaeological  evidence supports  the  earlier  date  (Graham  ( 2001)  38),  but  the  exis- tence  of  two  different  foundation  dates  may  perhaps  suggest a  kind  of  refoundation  in  C 6m,  as  a  consequence  of  the arrival  of  refugees  from  Phokaia  after  the  Persian  conquest of  Ionia  (Gras  ( 1987);  Dom\u00ednguez  ( 1991b)  250\u00ad53;  Bats ( 1994);  Gras  ( 1995)).  All  the  sources  agree  on  the  metropolis: Phokaia  (Hecat.  fr. 55;  Thuc. 1.13\u00ad14;  Arist.  fr. 560),  though there  is  no  unanimity  concerning  the  oecist(s):  it  was Euxenos  (Arist.  fr. 560),  or  Simos  and  Protis  (Just.  Epit. spain  and  france  165 43.3.8\u00ad11),  or  Protis  (Plut.  Sol. 2.7)  the  son  of  Euxenos (Arist.);  or  Kreontiades  (Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 8); finally,  Strabo  4.1.4  stresses  the  role  of  the  Ephesian  woman Aristarche  as  \u00b5    ,  whatever  that  means (Malkin  ( 1990)  51\u00ad52).  Similarly,  there  are  different  founda- tion  myths  for  the  city  in  Classical  sources:  marriage  of  the Greek  oecist  to  the  daughter  of  the  native  king  (Arist.  fr. 560 and  Just.  Epit. 43.3.4\u00ad12,  with  some  variations);  a  completely different  tradition,  including  the  flight from Phokaia during the  Persian  conquest,  is  found  in  Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 8  and  Timaios  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 72.Strabo 4.1.4  gives  details which  may  correspond  to  any  of  these  traditions.  Despite the  marriage  between  the  Greek  oecist  and  the  native  king's daughter,  which  led  to  the  foundation  of  the  city  according to  Arist.  fr. 560,  Massalia  was  always  considered  a  Hellenic and  not  a  mixed  polis  (cf.  Ps.-Skylax  4;Livy  37.54.22  (r 189)). The  territory is  called  (Strabo  4.2.3);  the toponym  may  also  have  been  used  to  denote  the  territory (cf.  Brunel  ( 1945));  it  is  referred  to as   at  Arist.  Mir.  ausc. 837b8  (cf.  Ps.-Skylax  4)  and  is described  as  planted  with  olives  and  vines  but  poor  in  grain (Strabo  4.1.5).  The  territory  of  Massalia  has  been  the  subject of  much  discussion  (Bats  ( 1986)  17\u00ad19;Morel ( 1986))  and  it is  now  supposed  that  throughout  the  Archaic  and  Classical periods  Massalia  possessed  a  territory  of  c. 70  km \u00b2  (Arcelin ( 1986)  74),  territorial  expansion  taking  off  only  in  C 3 (Strabo  4.1.5;  Bats  ( 1986);  Arcelin  ( 1986)  52\u00ad75).  In  any  case, there  are  hardly  any  archaeological  traces  of  the  occupation of  the  territory  (Arcelin  ( 1986)  47).  Apart  from  controlling its  territory proper,  Massalia  seems  to have founded,  and kept  under  its  sway,  a  network  of  coastal  cities  (Strabo  4.1.5,  9)  with  the  intention  of  protecting  the  coast  against incursions  of  inland  barbarians.  Leaving  aside  the  very problematic  cases  of  the  cities  in  Iberia  (Emporion,  Rhode, etc.),  the  beginning  of  this  policy  can  be  dated  to  C 5l,  which saw  the  foundation  of  Agathe,  and  its  continuation  is marked  by  the  foundations  of  Olbia  (C 4s),  Tauroeis  (C 3l) and  Nikaia  (C 3l/C2e?),  the  only  cities  for  which  we  have acceptable  dates  (Bats  ( 1986)  27\u00ad30).  The  way  in  which Massalia  controlled  these  foundations  is  incompletely known  (Gschnitzer  ( 1958)  20\u00ad26),  although  in  general  it seems  that  the  majority  (or  all)  of  them  may  have  been dependent  \"poleis  founded  as  fortresses\"  in  the  typology  of Hansen  ( 1997b)  36  no. 12;  however,  in  no  case  can  polis  status be  proved,  and  accordingly  each  city  is  briefly described in the  Introduction  above. If  we  can  trust  Justinus'  retrospective narrative,  Massalia had  a  foedus  and  amicitia  with  Rome  from  the  time  of  its foundation  (Just.  Epit. 43.3.4,5.3),completed  in  C 4e  with  the granting  to  Massalia  of  immunitas  and  the  establishment (or  renewal?)  of  a  foedus  aequo  iure  (Just.  Epit. 43.5.  10;see Nenci  ( 1958)  63\u00ad97).  Massalia  sent  envoys  to  Delphi  in  C 4e (Just.  Epit. 43.5.8). The  armed  forces  of  Massalia,  especially  the  fleet,  were deployed  on  several  occasions;  thus,  a  naval  defeat  of  the Carthaginians  is  reported  for  the  very moment  of  the  foun- dation  (Thuc. 1.13.6;  Paus. 10.18.7)  as  well  as  for  later  occa- sions  (Just.  Epit. 43.5.2;  Gras  ( 1987)).  On  land  Massalia waged  wars  against  the  natives  from  the  foundation  of  the city  (Just.  Epit. 43.4.9\u00ad11,  5.1)  and  established  a  network  of fortified places for protection against the native populations (Just.  Epit. 43.3.13;Strabo 4.1.5,  9  (C 4?));  cf.  supra. It  has  been  suggested  that  the  total  population  of  the  city never  exceeded  20,000  inhabitants  (Bats  ( 1992)  273).  The existence  of ,  such  as  the  ,  is  attested  for  C 4 (Arist.  fr. 560). Massalia  had  an  oligarchic  constitution  (Arist.  Pol. 1305b4, 10,  1320b18,  1321a30);  the  enfranchised  citizens  are  referred  to as  the  politeuma,  and  access  to  the  politeuma  was  by  election of  those  found  worthy of  membership  (Arist.  Pol. 1321a29\u00ad31).  Aristotle  also  refers  to  an  undated  stasis  in Massalia  by  which  the  oligarchy  was  changed  into  a  consti- tution  that  came  closer  to  being  a  politeia,  the  positive  vari- ant  of  popular  rule  (Pol. 1305b1\u00ad4);  perhaps  its  outcome  is the  eunomic  aristocracy  mentioned  by  Strabo  4.1.5  for  his own  day  (or  that  of  his  informant(s)).  Some  Massiliote  laws are  referred  to  by  Theophr.  fr. 117,  Wimmer;  Ael.  VH 2.38.1; and  Livy  37.54.22  (r 189).  These  laws  were  Ionic  ( \u00b5 '  )  and  were  exhibited  in  public  (Strabo  4.1.5).  Val. Max. 2.6.7  mentions  the  death  penalty  as  having  been  used since  the  foundation  of  the  city. Massalia  had  a  council  (interpreted  as  a  senatus  by  Val. Max. 2.6.7)  called  the  Six  Hundred  (  ),  whose members  served  for  life  and  were  called  \u00b5 (I.Lampsakos 4.45,  48  (C 2e);  Strabo  4.1.5);  this  council  was presided  over  by the  Fifteen  (  ;Strabo 4.1.5;  Caesar,  BCiv. 1.35.1),who  were  in  turn  controlled  by  the Three  (  ;Strabo 4.1.5),  one  of  whom  was  chairman (Strabo  4.1.5)  and  possibly  the  eponymous  magistrate, although  this  is  not  confirmed.  There  is  no  solid  evidence for  the  existence  of  an  assembly  at  Massalia;  however,  the existence  of  a  demos  may  possibly  be  implied  by  the  refer- ence  to  the  public  exhibition  ( \u00b5) of  the  laws  (Strabo 4.1.5),  and  IG xiv  357  (C 1?)  has  sometimes  been  interpreted to  prove  the  existence  of  a  demos,  but  it  is  a  problematic  document:  Properzio  ( 1989)  296\u00ad97  denies  that  it  alludes  to 166 dom\u00ednguez a  Massaliote  demos,  while  Clerc  ( 1927)  451  n. 1  considers  the inscription  a  falsum. In C 2,  and  almost  certainly  before,  the  agora  of  Massalia was  situated  in  a  low-lying  area  between  the  two  main  eleva- tions  of  the  city,  Saint-Laurent  hill  and  Moulins  hill  (Gant\u00e8s ( 1992)  85).  Although  it  has  not  been  found,  Massalia  pre- sumably  had  a  temple  dedicated  to  Athena,  since  Strabo 13.1.41  refers  to its  just  as  Just.  Epit. 43.5.6  (rC 5?) alludes  to  its  simulacrum  and  to  the  porticus  of  the  temple, situated  on  the  arx.  The  city  also  possessed  a  devoted to  Apollo  Delphinios  and  a  temple  ( ) dedicated to Artemis  Ephesia,  both  on  the  (Strabo  4.1.4).  A  monu- mental  Ionic  C 6l  capital  has  been  unearthed  (Benoit ( 1954)),as  has  a  set  of  fifty tiny C 5e  naiskoi  with  a  seated  god- dess  pertaining  to  two  different  sanctuaries  (Clerc  ( 1927) 227\u00ad40);  a  possible  C 4e  Thesmophorion  has  also  been  ident- ified (Gant\u00e8s ( 1992)  79,  85).  The  water  management  system of  the  city  was  very  elaborate,  with  cisterns,  water  reservoirs and  drains,  some  of  them  dating  to  C 6e  (Trouset  ( 1990)). There  is  an  epigraphical  reference  to a  stadion  (perhaps  of Roman  date:  Benoit  ( 1966)  20);  from  the  foundation  of  the city  the  harbour  received  special  attention  and  many  substantial  structures  related  to  it  have  been  excavated,  the oldest  ones  dating  to  C 6l  (Gu\u00e9ry  ( 1992);  Hesnard  ( 1995) 65\u00ad78). Massalia  had  an  acropolis;  Strabo  4.1.4  refers  to the ,  presumably  the  acropolis,  and  furthermore  refers  to the ,  presumably  a  part  within  the  acropolis.  The acropolis  was  perhaps  encircled  by  a  separate  wall,  different from  that  around  the  city  proper  according  to  Strabo  him- self  ( 4.1.4;  Tr\u00e9ziny  ( 1994)  128\u00ad29,  modified in T r\u00e9ziny  ( 2001) 49).Just.Epit.43.4  implies  the  existence  of  walls  from  at  least the  second  generation  of  colonists.  There  are  remains  of  an early  (C 6l)  city  wall  which  already  enclosed  the  area  of  the later  city  almost  in  its  entirety;  in  C 4  a  new  defensive system was  built  and  the  previous  wall  razed  to  the  ground  at  sever- al  points  (Tr\u00e9ziny  ( 1994)  125\u00ad30,(1995)  44\u00ad45,(2001)  45\u00ad53). During  C 6f  Massalia  slowly  expanded  and  came  to  occu- py  almost 25  ha;  in  C 6m  the  extent  of  the  city  was  already more  or  less  similar  to  that  of  the  later  city  (c. 40  ha  (Tr\u00e9ziny ( 2001)  53).  While  some  houses  and  other  urban  features  are known  from  C 6e,  the  general  layout  of  the  city  is  not  fully known,  though  there  is  some  evidence  of  C 6m  grid  plan- ning  (Tr\u00e9ziny  ( 1995)  50);  perhaps  the  main  axis  of  the  city was  constituted  by  the  prolongation,  inside  the  city,  of  the road  that  entered  the  city  through  the  eastern  gate  and  led  to the  agora.  In C 4f  some  quarters  of  the  city  had  a  regular  plan (Gant\u00e8s  ( 1992);  Moliner  ( 2001)  101\u00ad8). Strabo  4.1.4  seems  to  imply  that  the  patron  divinity  was Artemis  Ephesia.  Also  attested  is  the  cult  of  Athena  (Strabo 13.1.41),  supposed  by  some  scholars  to  be  the  protective divinity  of  the  city  (Tr\u00e9ziny  ( 1994)  129\u00ad30).  Massalia  cele- brated  the  Anthesteria  (referred  to by Just.  Epit. 43.4.6  (rC 6) as  Floralia)  and  the  Thargelia  (Serv.  ad  Aen. 3.57;  Lact.  Plac. comm.  ad  Stat.  Theb. 10.798;  IG xiv  2464(?);  Salviat  ( 1992) 144\u00ad45). Massalia  erected  a  treasury  at  Delphi  (Diod. 14.93.4 (r 396),  App.  Ital. 8.3  (r 396;rC4m)),  identified w ith  the  so-called  Aiolian  treasure  at  Marmaria  and  dated  between 540  and 530  (Salviat  ( 1981)).  Paus. 10.8.6\u00ad7  furthermore mentions  a  statue  of  Athena  dedicated  at  Delphi  as  well  as  one  of  Apollo  ( 10.18.7)  dedicated  to  commemorate  a naval  victory  over  the  Carthaginians;  Just.  Epit. 43.5.8  (rC 4e) also  refers  to the  dedication  of  offerings  to Apollo  at  Delphi. The  mint  of  Massalia  struck  silver  coins  from  c. 525/520  to 470/460  of  the  so-called  Auriol-type,  heavily  influenced b y contemporary  Ionian  issues  (Furtw\u00e4ngler  ( 1978)).  From C 5m  Massaliote  coins  became  more  similar  to  the  coins issued  in  Magna  Graecia  and  Sicily,  and  down  to  C 4e  we  can trace  at  least  seven  issues  of  obols  weighing  from  0.71  to 0.85 g,  with  types  mainly  reminiscent  of  those  found  in  Sicily. Many  of  these  issues  carry  the  legend  ,  or even (in  the  Doric  dialect;  Brenot ( 1992)).  The  minting  of  obols,  although  progressively  of lower  weight,  continued  until  C 3l  (Brenot  ( 1980)).  In  C 4e begins  the  minting  of  a  new  and  short-lived  coin,  a  drachm weighing  3.75  g  (called  a  \"heavy  drachm\"  to  distinguish  it from  the  \"light  drachm\"  weighing  2.65  g  issued  from  C 3l). Issues  of  this  coin  ceased  in  360.It  shows  on  the  obv.  Artemis Ephesia  and  on  the  rev.  a  lion  similar  to  the  lion  on  the  coins of  Elea;  the  legend  is  (this  time  in Ionic  dialect;  Brenot  ( 1982)).It  has  been  argued  that  all  these coins  were  struck  on  the  Phokaian  standard,  despite  the  dif- ferent  weights  used  in  the  different  issues  (Garc\u00eda-Bellido ( 1994);  SNG  Cop.  Spain-Gaul 708\u00ad28). 4. ", "Alalie": "Identifier: 3. , Map 48b.  Lat. 42.10,long.  9.70.  Size  of  territory: 3(?).  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is  ,  (Hdt. 1.165.1, 166.3).  A  city-ethnic  is  not  attested;  Herodotos  refers  to  the community  as     ( 1.166.2  bis). Alalie  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Hdt. 1.165.1 (  ).  The  name  of  the  territory  is unknown,  but  its  extent,  after  C 6m  when  the  refugees  from Phokaia  arrived,  has  been  calculated  at  200  km \u00b2  (Gras  ( 1985) 404),  and  it  may  have  been  divided  into  lots  (Jehasse  and Jehasse  ( 1987)  380).  The  \"epoecised\"  city  put  a  fleet of  sixty ships  to  sea  (Hdt. 1.166.2),  which  indicates  a  population  of c. 20,000  inhabitants  (Gras  ( 1985)  400\u00ad6)  or  even  more (Dom\u00ednguez  ( 1985)  375\u00ad76). Alalie  was  founded  by  Phokaia  (no. 859),  in  accordance with  an  oracle, 20  years  before  the  fall  of  Phokaia,  i.e.  c. 560 (Hdt. 1.165.1).  In  c. 546  the  Phokaians  decided  to  relocate their  city  in  reaction  to  the  Persian  threat,  and  almost  half  of the  Phokaians  were  received  at  Alalie.  From  the  Alalian point  of  view,  the  arrival  of  these  refugees  may  have  been perceived  as  reception  of  epoikoi,  while  from  the  point  of view  of  the  Phokaians  it  was  a  case  of  metoikesis  (Demand ( 1990)  37).  The  refugees  arrived  with  wives,  sons  and  sacred objects  from  their  home  sanctuaries  (Hdt. 1.164.3,  166.3). After  a  naval  battle  with  the  Carthaginians  and  the Etruscans  c. 540,  in  which  the  Alalians  were  victorious  but suffered  severe  losses,  the  city  was  perhaps  dismantled  (Hdt. 1.166.3: [.  .  .]       ),and certain- ly  abandoned  (Hdt. 1.166.3:      [.  .  .]                 `).  However,  the  abandonment  was  perhaps  not complete,  as  the  existence  of  some  archaeological  remains dated  to  C 6l  (and  antedating  the  foundation(?)  of  the Etruscan  city)  would  suggest  (Jehasse  and  Jehasse  ( 1982)  255; cf.  Dom\u00ednguez  ( 1985)  376\u00ad77).  In  any  case,  after  the  battle, Alalie  ceased  to  be  a  polis  and  its  site  was  subsequently  occu- pied  by  an  Etruscan  city,  whose  cemetery  (C 6l\u00adC3m)  has been  excavated  (Jehasse  and  Jehasse  ( 1973)). Herodotos 1.166.3  seems  to  imply  the  existence  of  a  politi- cal  body  making  decisions,  but  its  composition  or  organisa- tion  is  unknown.  At  1.166.1  he  implies  the  existence  of religious  precints  ( )  at  Alalie,  some  of  them  perhaps  of  a substantial  nature  (temples?--he uses the v erb  ); besides,  the  Phokaian  refugees  carried  with  them  all  the sacred  objects,  statues  and  offerings  (    \u00b5  [.  .  .]         \u00b5) taken from their original hiera  at Phokaia--except those made of  bronze  and  stone  and  the paintings  (Hdt. 1.164.3)--and w e  may  think  that  they  placed these  in  newly  built  edifices as soon as they arrived at Alalie; however,  they  have  not  been  identified.  Remains  of  a  city  wall have  been  discovered,  of  the  agger  type,  with  a  broad  glacis  in spain  and  france  163 front  of  it,  perhaps  dated  to  C 6s  (Jehasse  and  Jehasse  ( 1982) 250\u00ad53,(1994)  312\u00ad14)  and  perhaps  protecting  the  Greek  city. There  are  also  remains  of  C 6s  dwellings  constructed  in  mud- brick  (Jehasse  and  Jehasse  ( 1994)  312)  as  well  as  Greek  pottery of  Archaic  date  (Jehasse  and  Jehasse  ( 1982)  251\u00ad54). 2.  Emporion  (Emporites) Map  25.  Lat. 42.10,long.  3.10. Size of  territory: 2.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is  '\u00b5, (Ps.-Skylax  2;  Ps.-Skymnos  204)  and  the  city-ethnic  is '\u00b5  (SEG 37  838  ( 530\u00ad500);  Strabo  3.4.8)  or '(C4l coins,infra).Some scholars have suggest- ed  that  the  original  name  may  have  been  Pyrene  (Hind ( 1972))  or  *Kypsela  (Lamboglia  ( 1949),(1974);Oikonomides ( 1974))  and  one  of  these  names  (in  particular  Pyrene)  might well  have  been  the  name  of  the  first settlement,  which  was renamed    (Strabo  3.4.8)  when  the  (new)  city on  the  mainland  was  founded;  however,  there  is  no  evidence for  the  use  of  any  of  these  names  to refer  to Emporion, whose  name  is  presumably  attested  already  in  C 6l  (SEG 38 838;  cf.  supra). Apart  from  Ps.-Skylax  2  (Hansen  ( 1997a)  88),  the  earliest references  to Emporion  as  a  polis  are  in  Polyb. 3.39.7  and Ps.-Skymnos  202\u00ad4  (all  in  the  urban  sense).  It  is  described  as a  polis  in  the  urban  and  political  sense  by  Strabo  3.4.8,  a  pas- sage  which  also  refers  to  the  politeuma  and  uses  dipolis  about Emporion.  If  Pyrene  at  Hdt. 2.33.2  designates  the  present city,  this  passage  provides  an  occurrence  of  polis  in  the  territ- orial  sense.  It is  usually  inferred  from  the  toponym  that Emporion  was  an  emporion.  For  a  discussion  of  this  ques- tion,  see  Hansen  (forthcoming).  The  collective  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  a  C 6l  inscription  (SEG 37 838)  and  on  coins  ( ,  ,  (C 5l\u00adC4); (C4l\u00adC3);Villaronga (1994)  3\u00ad8,  1730)  and externally  in  a  commercial  document  of  C 5m  (SEG 38  1036). Emporion  was  founded  c. 600  (Aquilu\u00e9  et al.( 1996) 61\u00ad62),  whether  by  Massaliote  Phokaians  (Ps.-Skymnos 203\u00ad4),Massaliotes  (Ps.-Skylax  2;Strabo 3.4.8)  or  Phokaians (Livy  26.19,  34.4;  cf.  Pliny  3.22).  Ps.-Skymnos  204\u00ad5  includes Emporion  among  the  Greek  poleis  founded  by  Massalia (   `,     \u00b7  \u00b5 '\u00b5);  Strabo  4.1.5  seems  to imply  that  Emporion  was  included  within  the  system  of fortresses  set  up  by  Massalia  to  protect  the  coast  (supra 162\u00ad63).  However,  on  present  evidence  it  is  not  clear  how long  Emporion  remained  within  that  Massaliote  system  (cf. Gschnitzer  ( 1958)  25\u00ad26). The  territory of  Emporion  stretched  into  the  interior  of the  country  (mesogaia),  and  at  least  a  part  of  it  was  called '   (Strabo  3.4.9).  According  to  some scholars,  the  territory  comprised  360  km \u00b2  and  may  have been  bordered  by  native  villages  (Plana  ( 1994)  109\u00ad16).  In one  of  these  the  remains  of  a  possible  C 3  sanctuary  of Demeter  have  been  found;  it  may  have  replaced  an  older shrine  (Pons  ( 1993)).  The  existence  of  a  C 4  cadaster  occupy- ing 15,000  ha  has  also  been  proposed  (Plana  ( 1994)  169\u00ad89). However,  these  figures seem t oo  high  for  such  a  tiny  urban centre,  and  other  scholars  have  suggested  a  smaller  territory of  c. 3,300  ha: 1,300  ha  of  arable  land  and  2,000  ha  of  eschatia (Sanmart\u00ed  ( 1993)  92\u00ad94).  The  reference  in  Strabo  3.4.8  to Rhode  (no. 4)  as  a   '\u00b5  seems  to  imply that,  at  least  by  C 1s,  Emporion  had  integrated  the  territory of  Rhode  into  its  own  territory. On  the  basis  of  the  size  of  the  city  ( 5  ha),  it  has  been  sup- posed  that  the  inhabitants  numbered  max. 1,500\u00ad2,000 (Dom\u00ednguez  ( 1986)  4;  Marcet  and  Sanmart\u00ed  ( 1990)  118\u00ad19). Originally  Emporion  was  divided  into  separate  Greek and  non-Greek  communities,  but  at  a  certain  point  the  two communities  merged  into  one  to  form  a  single  citizen  body of  mixed  ethnicity  (Strabo  3.4.8;  Pena  ( 1988)  11\u00ad27;  Santiago ( 1994a)).  This  merger  may  have  taken  place  c. 375,  when  the second  city  wall  was  constructed,  thus  suppressing  an  extra- urban  settlement  (assigned  to  the  natives  by  its  excavator), and  situated  by  the  C 5  city  wall  (Sanmart\u00ed  ( 1993)  88\u00ad89). The  existence  of  a  political  community  is  indicated  by  the C 5\u00adC4  mint  (infra)  and  by  bricks  stamped   ( \u00b5/\u00b5) and dated perhaps to C3  (Almagro ( 1952)  no. 35;  Pena  ( 1992)  141).  The  only  reference  to the political  system  is  found  in  Strabo  3.4.8,  which  refers  to a \u00b5 \u00b5  of  Greek  and  barbarian  \u00b5\u00b5  pro- duced  by  the  merger  described  supra.A C 5s  lead  tablet found  at  Emporion  contains  the  word  (or  the  ending) \u00b5,  although  its  precise  meaning  cannot  be  determined (Almagro ( 1952)  no. 21;  Pena  ( 1992)  140\u00ad41;  Santiago  ( 1993) 288\u00ad89).  The  honours  owed  to  Artemis  Ephesia  were  pre- sumably  defined b y  law  (Strabo  4.1.4),  and  in  later  sources there  are  references  to custom  (mos)  and  laws  (leges; Livy  34.9  (rC 2e)).  Livy  ( 34.9  (rC 3e))  also  refers  to several magistrates. The  agora  of  the  city  is  known only  in  its  C 2f  form  (Mar and  Ruiz  de  Arbulo  ( 1993)  160\u00ad69).  Although  Artemis Ephesia  was  worshipped  at  Emporion  (Strabo  3.4.8),  her sanctuary  has  not  yet  been  identified.  A  C 5s  sanctuary  con- sisting  of  at  least  an  Ionic  temple  and  a  double  altar  has  been excavated  in  the  southern  part  of  the  city.  In  C 4f  the  area  was reorganised  and  a  new  sanctuary  constructed,  perhaps devoted  to  Asklepios;  the  Palaia  polis  has  yielded  a  relief 164 dom\u00ednguez depicting  two  sphinxes,  almost  certainly  from  a  temple (Marcet  and  Sanmart\u00ed  ( 1990)  69).  The  city  had  a  public water  reservoir,  dug  in  C 4e,  and  included  within  the  sacred area  placed  in  the  southern  part  of  the  city,  by  the  city  walls and  their  southern  entrance  gate  (ibid.  ( 1990)  87).  The  earli- est  Greek  settlement,  in  antiquity  situated  on  an  island  that is  now  connected  to  the  continent,  may  have  functioned  as the  acropolis;  it  was  called     (Strabo  3.4.8). Strabo  3.4.8  mentions  the  existence  of  a  city  wall  at Emporion  and  sketches  the  history  of  its  development.  The first wall so far known was c onstructed  in  C 5s  in  the  south- ern  part  of  the  city  (Sanmart\u00ed  and  Nolla  ( 1986));  c. 375  that wall  was  dismantled  and  in  the  same  area  a  new  wall  was constructed  with  an  elaborate  L-shaped  entrance  system (Sanmart\u00ed  et al.( 1992));  this  is  certainly  the  wall  mentioned by  Livy  34.9.  In  C 3s  a  proteichisma  was  constructed;  howev- er,  in  C 2m  all  these  fortifications w ere  demolished  and, reusing  the  same  stones,  a  new  wall  was  constructed  20  m further  out,  a  wall  that  is  still  preserved  (Sanmart\u00ed  et al. ( 1988)).According  to  Livy  34.9  (rC 2e),the  defence  of  the  city walls  of  the  polis  was--at least in times of  war--entrusted t o one-third  of  the  inhabitants,  who  were on  duty  every  night. The  oldest  remains  of  dwellings  come  from  the  Palaia polis  and  consist  of  rectangular  rooms  in  mudbrick  on  stone basements;  they  date  to  C 6f  (Aquilu\u00e9  et al.( 1996)  57\u00ad58, ( 1999)  217\u00ad30).  The  city  on  the  mainland  seems  to  have reached  its  maximum  extent  already  in  C 5s,  which  makes  it difficult t o  sketch  the  first stages of  its  development  and  lay- out;  in  any  case,  it  seems  to  have  been  centred  on  a  main street  running  north\u00adsouth  and  crossed  at  right  angles  by secondary  streets  (Marcet  and  Sanmart\u00ed  ( 1990)  106\u00ad8). The  patron  divinity  of  Emporion  was  Artemis  Ephesia (Strabo  3.4.8);  cults  of  the  Nymphs,  Themis  and  Poseidon are  epigraphically  attested  (Almagro  ( 1952)  nos. 9\u00ad11,  49),  as are  cults  of  Asklepios  and  Sarapis;  in  all  these  cases  the  evid- ence  is  Hellenistic  or  Roman. The  mint  of  Emporion  possibly  began  to  strike  silver coins  of  the  Auriol  type  in  C 5f,  imitating  Massaliote  proto- types.  From  C 5m  the  mint  produced  minor  denominations and  was  under  the  influence of  Sicily,  Mainland  Greece  and Asia  Minor;  their  weights  vary  from  0.15/0.25  g  to  0.40/0.45 g  and  0.90/0.95  g;  the  coins  are  anepigraphic.  C 5l/C4f  coins are  inscribed  with  the  legend  ,  or and show  influences from M agna  Graecia  and  Athens; the  weight  is  0.94  g.  From C 4l  Emporion  struck  a  so-called  drachm  weighing  4.70  g.  Types:  obv.  head  of  a  goddess  (Artemis?); legend: or ;  rev.  horse  (Villaronga  ( 1997)).  It  is  quite possible  that  all  these  coins  were  struck  on  the  Phokaian standard  (Campo  ( 1992);  Garc\u00eda-Bellido  ( 1994)),  and  both the  first issues and the drachms seem also t o  be  related  to  the weights  of  the  Massaliote  system  (Villaronga  ( 1998);  Head, HN \u00b21\u00ad2;  SNG  Cop.  Spain-Gaul 637\u00ad39). Emporion  was  perhaps  considered  to  be  the  coloniser  of nearby  Rhode  (no. 4;Strabo 3.4.8).  A  very  fragmentary  C 5s lead  tablet  has  the  sequence  [.  .  .  ]    ,mean- ing  something  like  \"where  to  establish  (or  found)  a  city\" (Almagro ( 1952)  no. 21;  Pena  ( 1992)  140\u00ad41;  Santiago  ( 1993) 288\u00ad89),  though  it  is  unclear  where  and  when  the  eventual foundation  was  to  be  planted. 3.

Rhode  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skymnos 202\u00ad4.Strabo 3.4.8  describes  it  as  a  polichnion.  The  internal collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  by  C 4l  coin  leg- ends  (infra). spain  and  france  167 According  to  Strabo  14.2.10,  Rhode  was  colonised  by Rhodians  prior  to  the  foundation  of  the  Olympic  Games. Ps.-Skymnos  ( 205\u00ad6;  cf.  Strabo  3.4.8)  also  alludes  to  a Rhodian  foundation  and  to  later  Massaliote  occupation (Ps.-Skymnos  203;  cf.  Strabo  14.2.10).  Strabo  3.4.8  states  that Rhode  belonged  to  Emporion  (no. 2).  The  sources  thus seem  to  imply  a  double  foundation,  first b y  Rhodes  and afterwards  by  Massalia  (Strabo  14.2.10),  or  Phokaians  from Massalia  (Ps.-Skymnos  202\u00ad6),  or,  alternatively,  by Rhodians  and  Emporitans  (Strabo  3.4.8).  The  much  debat- ed  Rhodian  foundation  must,  however,  be  rejected (Dom\u00ednguez  ( 1990);  Santiago  ( 1994b)  59\u00ad63;  Graham  ( 2001) 36\u00ad37).  The  short  and  obscure  reference  by  Strabo  14.2.10  to the  causes  of  the  Rhodian  foundation  of  Rhode  (      )  may  possibly  be  based  on  a foundation  myth,  but  such  a  myth  must  be  of  a  late  date (Dom\u00ednguez  ( 1990)). The  only  reference  to public  enactments  is  found  in Strabo  4.1.4,  where  he  alludes  to  the  enacting  by  law  of  the honours  owed  to  Artemis  Ephesia.  This  goddess  had  a  tem- ple  in  Rhode  (Strabo  3.4.8,  4.1.4)  and  was  the  patron  divini- ty  of  the  city  (Strabo  3.4.8). Although  the  site  of  the  Greek  city  has  yielded  ceramic evidence  dating  to  C 6l(?)  and  C 5  (Mart\u00edn,  Nieto  and  Nolla ( 1979)  326\u00ad27;  Viv\u00f3  ( 1996)  112),  the  earliest  levels  associated with  habitation  date  from  C 4e  (Puig  et al.( 1994\u00ad95)  128). However,  the  layout  of  the  settlement  at  this  date  is  almost unknown,  since  in  C 3e  the  city  underwent  a  complete  reor- ganisation  which  obliterated  the  previous  houses;  it  has, however,  been  suggested  that  the  layout  was  more  or  less regular  (Puig  et al.( 1996));  the  C 4e  houses  had  foundations of  large  stones  (Puig  et al.( 1994\u00ad95)  128);  in  C 3e,  the  city  was reorganised  and  enlarged  with  the  construction  of  a  new quarter  on  a  regular  plan,  with  streets  crossing  each  other  at right  angles;  some  of  the  streets  discovered  so  far  are  4  m wide  (Mart\u00edn,  Nieto  and  Nolla  ( 1979)  269\u00ad311;  Viv\u00f3  ( 1996); Mart\u00edn  and  Puig  ( 2001)  59\u00ad60).  In  C 3l  a  strong  city  wall  was erected  and  enclosed  all  of  the  settlement  (Puig  et al.( 1996) 243\u00ad44;  Puig  ( 1998b)  155\u00ad63);  in  its  eastern  course  the  wall perhaps  served  also  to  channel  the  river  and  to  give  way  to harbour  constructions  (Puig  ( 1998a)  118). Rhode  was  perhaps  considered  one  of  the  fortresses established  by  Massalia  to  protect  the  coast  from  barbar- ians  living  inland  (Strabo 4.1.5);  in  addition,  Strabo describes  Rhode  as  a '\u00b5  ( 3.4.8). Clearly,  these  classifications  must  refer  to  different  periods, but  it  is  not  known  when  and  how  Rhode  was  integrated into  the  Massaliote  dominion,  nor  when  it  came  under Emporitan  control,  though  it  seems  that  it  came under  Emporitan  influence  only  in  the  Roman  period (C 3l/C2e). Rhode  apparently  struck  only  a  minor  series  of  drachms, weighing  4.70  g,  between  C 4l  and  C 3e.

Prior  to  the  expansion  of  the  Thessalians,  the area  was  Perrhaibian  (Strabo 9.5.19\u00ad20).  To  the  north  its territory  was  bounded  by  that  of  Phalanna,  and  to  the north-east  by  that  of  Argoussa;  and  to  the  south-east  by Krannon. A  board  of  tagoi  is  attested  by  SEG 45  553  (C 6\u00adC5)  (Helly ( 1995)  31\u00ad32,148).SEG  27  184  (C 4e)  lists  (cf.SEG35 494).  During  the  crisis  of 330\u00ad326  Atrax  received  10,000 medimnoi  of  grain  from  Kyrene  (Tod  196.24). A  survey  by  the  Institut  Courby  and  the  ephorate  of Larisa  in  1977  produced  evidence  of  public  architecture,  all presumably  of  C 4  and  Hellenistic  times,  including  remains of  sanctuaries  of  unidentified divinities (cf.  infra  on  cults)  as well  as  remains  of  a  theatre.  In  C 5e  the  acropolis  and  the slope  of  the  hill  were  enclosed  by  a  polygonal  circuit,  which was  rearranged  in  C 4m  in  connection  with  new  construc- tion  work.  C 4  saw  reconstruction  on  the  summit  of  the acropolis:  a  quadrangular  main  tower  and  strengthening  by a  new  wall  with  five t owers,  one  of  them  including  a  fortified gate.  The  eastern  part  of  the  wall  on  the  slope  was  reinforced by  serration  dated  to  C 4m  on  account  of  its  similarity  with constructions  at  Halos  (Reinders  ( 1988)  54).  The  lower  city proper  was  enclosed  by a  C 4  isodomic  wall  with  quadrangu- lar  towers.  The  wall  ran  for  3  km  and  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 64 ha.  The  main  gate  was  to  the  north-west  above  the  level  of the  plain,  and  access  was  provided  by  a  long  ramp  support- ed  by  a  polygonal  retaining  wall. Attested  cults  include  those  of  Apollo  Hebdomaios  (SEG 33  454  (C 4\u00adC3)),  Athena  Agoraia  (SEG 27  184  (C 5)),  Themis Agoraia  (SEG 27  183  (C 5)),  Zeus  Kataibates  (ArchDelt 48 ( 1993)  Chron. 255  no. 27  (C 4);  SEG 47  674),  Zeus  Thaulios (SEG 32  569  ( 450\u00ad425)),  Zeus  Homoloios  (SEG 35  493  (C 5)) and  Zeus  Tritodios  (SEG 34  494  (c. 300)). IG iv\u00b2.194b.3  ( 360/59)  lists  a  man  of  Atrax  as  theorodokos of  Epidauros  (Perlman  ( 2000)  178).  IG iv  617.7  ( 316\u00ad293) records  a  monetary  donation  by  Atrax  \"to  the  sent out  from  Argos  to  announce  the  celebration  of  the  Nemean Games  and  the  Heraia\"(Perlman  ( 2000)  74,127\u00ad29).Cf.CID ii  100.ii.5ff  ( 325),  presumably  a  collective  donation  towards the  rebuilding  of  the  temple  at  Delphi.

Krannon  is  listed  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  at  Thuc. 2.22.3;  in  Ps.-Skylax  64,  where polis  is  used  in  the  urban sense,  Krannon  is  one  of  nine  toponyms  listed  between  the heading    and  the  addendum         .

The  earliest  epigraphical  reference  to  a    is  in  a  C 3s  honorific decree ( IG ix.2 458).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  inter- nally  on  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2293\u00ad94  (C 5\u00adC4))  and  in  the decree  IG ix.2458  (C 3s);  externally  it  is  attested  in  Thuc. 2.22.3;Xen.  Hell. 4.3.3;  and  CID ii  7B.2  (c. 357).  The  external and  individual  use  is  found,  e.g.,  at  Hdt. 6.127.4,in  SEG 23 421  (C 4)  and  in  CID ii  24.i.14  (c. 336\u00ad323).Krannon  is  implic- itly  described  as  patre  (  patris)  in  Hdt. 6.127.1\u00ad4. Krannon  was  situated  in  Thessalia  (Hdt. 6.127.4;  Thuc. 2.22.3),  and  more  precisely  in  the  tetras  of  Pelasgiotis (Simon. 127,Page;  Hecat.  fr. 133;  cf.  Helly  ( 1995)  166).The  ter- ritory is  called     in  Callim.  Hymn 4.138. To  the  north,  it  was  bounded  by  the  territory  of  Larisa,  to  the west  by  that  of  Atrax,  to  the  east  by  that  of  Skotoussa,  while to  the  south  the  crest  line  of  the  Revenia  hills  separated  it 694 decourt,  nielsen,  helly  et  al. from  the  Enipeus  valley  (Decourt  ( 1990)  fig. 27). In C 6  the  most  prominent  family  in  the  political  life  of  the city  was  the  Skopadai  (RE  iiiA. 567\u00ad69;Helly ( 1995)  107\u00ad12). Cavalry  and  an  anonymous  cavalry  commander  are  attested in  Thuc. 2.22.3,when  Krannon  was  allied  with  Athens  along- side  other  Thessalian  cities.  Xen.  Hell. 4.3.3  mentions Krannon  among  the  allies  of  the  Boiotians,  again  alongside other  Thessalian  cities.  If  the  story  about  Deinias  in  Polyaen. 2.34  refers  to C 4  (cf.  RE  xi. 1583;Berve ( 1967)  294\u00ad95),the  city experienced  a  tyranny  in  this  period.  (The  same  source refers  to Krannonian  farming  out  of    and   .) In 369,  Krannon  joined Alexander  II  of  Makedon,  who  had  been  called  in  by  the Aleuadai  of  Larisa  in  their  struggle  against  Alexander  of Pherai,  and  the  city  was  presumably  garrisoned  by  the Makedonian  king  (Diod. 15.61.5);  the  garrison  was  probably removed,  as  was  a  similar  one  at  Larisa,  when  Pelopidas arrived  at  the  head  of  a  Boiotian  army  later  in  the  year (Diod. 15.67.4). SEG 23  421  is  probably  a  C 4  grant  of  proxenia  by Pherai  to two  citizens  of  Krannon.  Krauxidas  of  Krannon  was  victori- ous  in  the  horse-race  at  Olympia  in  648  (Paus. 5.8.8; Olympionikai 53). At  an  unknown  date  Krannon  became  a  walled  and  forti- fied city,  but  almost  nothing  is  known  about  the  acropolis and  the  urban  centre,  except  for  a  possible  temple  of  Athena Polias  on  the  acropolis  (Arvanitopoulos  ( 1922\u00ad24)). The  main  cults  of  the  Krannonians  seem  to  be  those  of Athena  (IG ix.2460  (C 2);  cf.  Arvanitopoulos  ( 1922\u00ad24)  37), Asklepios  (ArchDelt 43B:  280  (C 3);  IG ix.2461  (C 2))  and Apollo  (Prournios:  Habicht  ( 1981)  (c. 200);  Tempeitas:  Prakt ( 1915)  17  (C 3?)).  Other  cults:  Ennodia  (LIMC ii  882 (C 4s)),  Poseidon  (Head,  HN \u00b2293\u00ad94  (C 4))  and  Zeus (Megas:  ArchDelt 43B:  280  (C 3?);  Notios:  ArchDelt 16B:  182 (C 4)). Krannon  struck  silver  coins  in  C 5  and  bronze  coins  in  C 4. ( 1)  Silver, 480\u00ad400.

Metropolis  is  listed  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  under the  heading   \u00b5    in  CID ii  5.ii.25\u00ad26, 32\u00ad33  ( 358).

According  to Strabo  9.5.17,  Metropolis  was  founded  by a synoecism  ( ) of  ...    \u00b5. The  terminus  ante  quem  for  this  synoecism  is  358,  the  year  in which  the  city  is  mentioned  in  the  naopic  accounts  in Delphi  (CID ii  5.ii.32\u00ad33;Diod.  15.30.5  (r 377)  does  not  refer to  Thessalian  Metropolis;  cf.  Stylianou  ( 1998)  280).  The  cir- cular  fortifications,  running  for  5  km,  are  located  in  the  plain and  encompass  an  isolated  hill;  the  masonry  style  of  the  cir- cuit  (isodomic  with  moat)  points  to  a  date  in  C 4f  for  its  con- struction  (C.  Indzesiloglou,  pers.  comm.).  The  earliest  coins of  the  city  are  likewise  dated  to  C 4f(infra).Among  the  com- munities  originally  participating  in  the  synoecism  were Onthyrion  (Strabo  9.5.17)  and  probably  Polichnai  (cf.  Helly in  BCH 94  ( 1970)  187),  but  the  city  expanded  after  the  foundation  (Strabo  9.5.17:     ).  Remains  are  reported  in  ArchDelt 35 ([ 1980]  1988)  Chron. 268\u00ad69  and 36  ( 1981)  Chron. 254;  BCH 113  ( 1989)  Chron. 637  and  fig. 116. Metropolis  was  a  Thessalian  community  (CID ii 5.ii.32\u00ad33)  situated  in  Hestiaiotis  (Strabo  9.5.17).  To  the north  the  neighbours  were  Ithome,  which  was  eventually absorbed  by  Metropolis  (Strabo  9.5.17),  Gomphoi  and Pelinna;  to  the  east  were  Methylion  and  Kieron;  to  the  south was  Onthyrion,  which  was  also  absorbed  by  Metropolis (supra);  to  the  west  was  the  Pindos  range. The  entry     in  CID ii  5.ii.32\u00ad33 ( 358)  presumably  indicates  membership  of  the  Thessalian Confederacy.  A  grant  of  C 3l  proxeny,  etc.  to a  citizen  of Krannon  is  published  by  Habicht  in  Klio 52  ( 1970)  143;  the inscription  also  testifies t o  a  system  of  phylai  and  boards  of magistrates.  A  cult  of  Aphrodite,  the  patron  divinity,  is attested  by  coins  (no.  ( 1)  infra)  and  Strabo  9.5.17  (citing Callim.  fr. 200a,  Pfeiffer);  public  documents  were displayed at  the  temple  of  Aphrodite  (cf.  PECS 576);  Apollo  is  likewise attested  by  coins,  and  a  C 6s  suburban  temple  dedicated  to Apollo  Hekatombios  has  been  excavated  by  C. Indzesiloglou. A  collective  donation  of 120  dr.  towards  the  rebuilding  of the  temple  at  Delphi  is  recorded  in  CID ii  5.ii.32\u00ad33  ( 358);  IG iv  617.9  ( 316\u00ad293)  has  been  restored  [] (Foucard,  accepted  by  Perlman  ( 2000)  75);  the  inscription records  monetary  donations  by  Thessalian  cities  \"to  the sent  out  from  Argos  to announce  the  celebration  of the  Nemean  Games  and  the  Heraia\"  (IG iv  617.10  (C 4l);  cf.

No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Pharkadon  a polis,  but  it  deserves  inclusion  here  as  a  probable  polis  on account  of  its  C 5\u00adC4  coinage  and  the  fact  that  in  360/59  an Epidaurian  theorodokos  resided  at  Pharkadon  (IG iv\u00b2.1 94.B.i.2).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested internally  on  C 5  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  Polyaen. 4.2.18  (r 356)  and  Diod. 18.56.5  (r 319). thessalia  and  adjacent  regions  701 Pharkadon  was  a  Thessalian  city  (Polyaen. 4.2.18  (r 356)) situated  in  the  tetras  of  Hestiaiotis  (Strabo  9.5.17).  It  has  tra- ditionally  been  located  on  a  double-peaked  hill,  Sykia,  above the  modern  village  of  Klotoko,  about  20  km  east  of  Trikkala (PECS  followed  by  Barr.).  However,  the  find of  an  inscrip- tion  referring  to     at  Palaiogardiki (Tziaphalias  ( 1992)  116\u00ad20),  a  site  normally  identified as Pelinna,  may  cast  some  doubt  on  the  identification of Pharkadon  with  Sykia  and  serve  as  a  reminder  that  the ancient  topography  of  this  part  of  Hestiaiotis  is  still  not completely  understood.  For  the  site  at  Palaiogardiki,  see supra  s.v.  Pelinna. At  the  site  of  Sykia  are  remains  of  Classical  and  later  forti- fications enclosing both peaks and a lower city (Kirsten ( 1938)  with  a  plan  at  1836).  Polyaen. 4.2.18  (r 356)  mentions  a poliorkia  of  Pharkadon  by Philip  II  of  Makedon  and  uses such  terms  as  teichos  and  pyrgos  to  describe  the  fortifica- tions.  The  account  refers  to  stegai  as  well,  and  thus  implies the  existence  of  buildings  inside  the  wall;  there  are,  however, no  remains  of  such  buildings.  In 319,  Pharkadonian  exiles were  explicitly  excluded  from  the  general  amnesty  decreed by  Polyperchon  (Diod. 18.56.5;  cf.  Martin  ( 1985)  104). Nothing  further  is  known  about  these  exiles,  but  their  very existence  indicates  a  defined body of  citizens.  A  C 3l  inscrip- tion  refers  to     and  a  system  of  phy- lai  (Tziaphalias  ( 1992)  116\u00ad20).  Philip's siege  and  the  fact that  exiles  from  Pharkadon  were explicitly  excluded  from Polyperchon's  general  amnesty  of 319  (Diod. 18.56.5)  suggest that  the  city  had  followed  an  anti-Makedonian  line  of  poli- cy  (Martin  ( 1985)  194;  Hammond  ( 1994)  48).  The  silver  coin depicting  Athena  (infra)  suggests  a  cult  of  Athena. Pharkadon  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard c. 480\u00ad400,  and  bronze  coins  in  C 4f.

The  toponym  is  ,  (IG iv 617.10  ( 316\u00ad293))  and  \u00b5  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iii.32 ( 230\u00ad220);  App.  B  Civ. 2.10.64);  the  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5 (C 4m  coins,  infra)  or  \u00b5  (C 4l  coins,  infra). According  to  Steph.  Byz. 666.7,  the  name  was  changed  to ,  and  this  is  borne  out  by  C 4m  coins  inscribed (infra); Livy  39.25  has Philippopolis,  presumably  a  reference  to Gomphoi. No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Gomphoi  a  polis,but it  may  be  included  here  on  account  of  its  C 4  coins  and  its monetary  donation  \"to  the  sent  out  from  Argos  to announce  the  celebration  of  the  Nemean  Games  and  the Heraia\"(IG iv  617.10  (C 4l);  cf.

Later  sources  vari- ously  describe  it  as  a  polis  (IG ix.2287  (C 1);  Plut.  Caes. 41.7; App.  B  Civ. 2.10.64),  as  a  polichne  (Cass.  Dio  41.51.4)  and  as  a phrourion  (Strabo  9.5.17).  The  only  attested  Classical  usage of  the  city-ethnic  is  the  internal  collective  use  found  on  C 4 coins  (infra). Gomphoi  was  situated  in  Thessalia  (Plut.  Caes. 41.7), more  specifically in H estiaiotis  (Strabo  9.5.17).It  is  located  at Episkopi  (Turkish  Rapsista),  about  5  km  north-east  of Mouzaki  and  10  km  south-west  of  Trikala,  on  the  eastern side  of  Mt.  Kerketion,  close  to the  border  with  Epeiros (Caes.  B  Civ. 3.80),  i.e.  via  Athamania.  The  remains  at  the site,  which  include  foundations  of  public  buildings,  fortifi- cations  and  habitation,  are  essentially  of  Roman  date. Gomphoi  struck  coins  of  silver  and  bronze  from  C 4m onwards.  ( 1)  Silver,  C 4m.  Denominations:  didrachm  and  drachm  on  the  Aiginetan  standard.

Byz. 215.20)  but  other- wise ,  (IG iv\u00b2.194b.4  ( 360/59);  Ephor.  fr. 93;Strabo 9.5.19).  The  city-ethnic  is  (Thuc. 2.22.3;  IG i\u00b3 92.6  (c. 416);  CID ii  31.72  ( 345/4)),  or  (CID ii 102.ii.B.20  ( 324/3),  119  (C 4l)). Gyrton  is  listed  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  at  Thuc. 2.22.3;  it  is  called  in  a  mythological  context  in  Orphica Argonautika 145.  The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-eth- nic  is  found  on  C 4  coins  (infra);  the  external  collective use  is found  in  Thuc. 2.22.3;  the  external  individual  use  is  found  in e.g.  IG i\u00b3  92  (c. 416)  and  CID ii  31.72  ( 345/4),  85  ( 344/3). The  mythological  people  Phlegyai  were  associated  with Gyrton  (Pherecydes  (FGrHist 3)  fr. 41e),  and  Strabo describes  it  as  both  Perrhaibian  and  Magnesian  ( 7a.1.14, 9.5.19;  cf.  Steph.  Byz. 215.20);  however,  by  the  Classical  peri- od  Gyrton  was  definitely a Thessalian c ommunity  (Thuc. 2.22.2\u00ad3;  IG i\u00b3  92  (c. 416))  in  the  tetras  of  Pelasgiotis. A  citizen  of  Gyrton  was  awarded  hereditary  proxenia  by Athens  in  c. 416  (IG i\u00b3  92).  In  360/59,  a citizen  of  Gyrton served  as  Epidaurian  theorodokos  (IG iv\u00b2.194b.4).  For  cit- izens  of  Gyrton  serving  the  Amphiktyonic  League  as naopoioi,see CID ii  31.72  ( 345/4),  85  ( 344/3),  74.i.67  ( 337/6), 75.ii.41  ( 336),  76.ii.16  ( 335),  79A.i.10  ( 334/3),  102.ii.B.20 ( 324/3).  A  Gyrtonian  cavalry  contingent  and  its  command- ers  ( ) are mentioned at Thuc.  2.22.2\u00ad3. Both  the  acropolis  and  the  lower  city  were  fortified,  pos- sibly  already  in  the  Archaic  period,  and  both  fortifications were  built  of  slate  (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  88\u00ad89  (the  site  is  not identified as G yrton  here)).  A  cult  of  Zeus  may  be  inferred from  C 4s  coin  types  (infra). Gyrton  struck  coins  of  silver  and  bronze  in  C 4.(1)  Silver (Aiginetan  standard):  Head,  HN \u00b2295  and  Babelon,  Trait\u00e9 ii. 4  no. 741  describe  a  C 4f  triobol:  obv.  head  of  nymph  facing; rev.  horse  feeding;  legend: .(2) Bronze,C4s: obv.  youthful  Gyrton  beside  horse's  head,  or  Apollo,  or  Zeus laureate;  rev.  nymph  Gyrtona,  or  bridled  horse;  legends: ,  or  (Head,  HN \u00b2295;Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 4  nos. 741\u00ad44;Rogers ( 1932)  nos. 227\u00ad37;  Moustaka  ( 1983)  101,112,119  and 125;  SNG Cop.

The  toponym  is  ,   (IG iv  617.8  ( 316\u00ad293));  at  Ps.-Skylax  64,  M\u00fcller  (GGM i) prints  (an  emendation  from  );  Strabo  9.5.14 has ;  I.Thessalie 15.2  (C 2e)  has  .  Tradition claims  that  before  the  arrival  of  the  Thessalians  the  city  was called (Steph.  Byz. 123.22).The  city-ethnic  is   (Head,  HN \u00b2292\u00ad93  (c. 400\u00ad344)),  or  (I.Thessalie 14 (C 3\u00adC2)). In  Ps.-Skylax 64,  where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense, Kierion  is  one  of  nine  toponyms  listed  between  the  heading and  the  addendum       ;  it  is  also  called  a  polis  in,  e.g.,  I.Thessalie 15.13 (C 2e).  [ ]\u00b5  is  found  in  IG ix.2269  (C 4?).  The  inter- nal  and  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on  coins thessalia  and  adjacent  regions  693 (Head,  HN \u00b2292\u00ad93  (C 4)).  In  C 3s  a  citizen  of  Kierion  served as  Delphic  theorodokos  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iii.26  ( 230\u00ad220)). According  to  Ps.-Skylax  64,  Kierion  was  situated  in Thessalia,  and  according  to  Strabo  9.5.14,  it  belonged  to  the tetras  of  Thessaliotis  (Helly  ( 1995)  165).  Because  the  city  lay in  very  flat and open land,  its  boundaries  are  not  clearly defined. At  Kierion  are  remains  of  a  circuit  wall,  the  earliest  phas- es  of  which  go  back  to  the  Classical  or  perhaps  the  Archaic period.  On  the  acropolis  a  Hellenistic  kastro  is  visible,  but earlier  activity  there  cannot  be  excluded.  Otherwise,  practi- cally  nothing  is  known  about  the  lower  town,  which  was probably  situated  on  the  eastern  side  of  the  hill  (St\u00e4hlin ( 1924a)  130\u00ad32;  autopsy  by  J.-C.  Decourt). Kierion  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard from  c. 400.  Denominations:  didrachms,  triobols,  tri- hemiobols,  obols  and  hemiobols.  Types:  obv.  head  of  Zeus, or  Arne,  or  Poseidon,  or  Apollo,  or  horse  feeding  or  gallop- ing;  rev.  youthful  male  god  (Asklepios?)  seated  on  a  throne or  rock,  or  nymph  Arne  kneeling,  or  head  of  Arne,  or  naked hero  warrior  fighting;  legend: ,  ,  , ,  .  Bronze  coinage  likewise begins  c. 400.  Obv.  head  of  Poseidon,  or  head  of  Zeus  laure- ate,  or  head  of  Apollo;  rev.

In  addition  to  these  divinities  there  is  evidence  of  cults  of Artemis  (IG ix.2271  (C 5)),  Herakles  (I.Thessalie 15  (C 2e)), and  Poseidon  Kouerios  (I.Thessalie 20  (C 3\u00adC2)). 399.  *Kondaia  (Kondaieus) Map  55.  Lat. 39.50,long. 22.25,  but  see  infra.  Size  of  territory: 2.  Type:  C  (classified as a  fort/tower  by Barr.,  but  see  infra).  A  toponym  is  not  attest- ed,  but  * may be assumed (cf.infraMondaia);it has been  proposed  to  emend  MS  at  Hdt. 5.63.3  to (cf.  Helly  ( 1995)  103),  but  the  city-ethnic  found  in Hellenistic  sources  is  (Gonnoi ii  no. 3.3  (C 3f)). The  location  is  uncertain,  but  the  community  should probably  be  located  at  the  ancient  site  at  Orthe  Magoula, near  the  modern  village  of  Phalanni  Larisis  (Helly  ( 1999)); Barr.  locates  it  at  Bakrina.  Both  locations  put  it  in  the  tetras of  Pelasgiotis. At 5.63.3  Herodotos  states  that  the  ... \u00b5  \u00b5 \u00b5                to support  the  Peisistratidai  of  Athens. is  most  prob- ably  a  corruption  of  a  Thessalian  city-ethnic,  and  it  has  been proposed  to restore  ,  to  be  interpreted  as  the  city- ethnic  of  Kondaia  (Helly  ( 1995)  103).  Since  there  is  no  other evidence  for  the  political  status  of  Kondaia  in  the  Archaic (or  Classical)  period,  the  inclusion  of  Kondaia  in  this Inventory  depends  upon  acceptance  of  this  emendation, which  would  provide  an  attestation  of  the  external  individ- ual  use  of  the  city-ethnic;  such  a  usage  is  often  indicative that  the  site  to  whose  toponym  the  ethnic  is  related  was  a polis  (Hansen  ( 1996)  182\u00ad87).

No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Oxynion  a  polis, though  Strabo  7.7.9  does.  The  reason  for  including  it  in  this Inventory  is  the  attestation  in  359  of  an  Epidaurian  theo- rodokos  (IG iv\u00b2  1.94.b.1);  note,  however,  that  Perlman  ( 2000) E. 1  fr.b. 1  prints  [],  not  '  as  IG.  Nothing further  is  known  about  the  city. Oxynion  has  traditionally  been  located  at  Meritsa  (mod- ern  Oxyneia)  north-west  of  Kalambaka,  but  this  location does  not  fit the indications provided b y  Strabo  7.7.9  that  it was 120  stades  from  Azoros.  The  same  applies  to  the  site  at Nea-Smolia  (Darmezin  ( 1992)).  A  site  near  Dasochori  may fit:  a  hill  on  the  left  bank  of  the  river  Paliomandano  at Paliogourtsia,  with  some  architectural  remains  on  the  sur- face  and  ceramics  covering  C 4  to  Roman  times;  however, epigraphical  confirmation is lacking (Darmezin ( 1994)). 407.

Larisa  was  a  Thessalian  community  (F.Delphes iii.4378 ( 342/1))  and  belonged  to  the  tetras  of  Pelasgiotis  (schol.  Ap. Rhod. 1.40).  The  name  of  the  territory  was   (Theopomp.  fr. 34;  on  this  fragment,  see  Martin  ( 1982));  it  is termed in  Theophr.  Caus.  pl. 5.14.2.  Theopomp.  fr. 34 mentions  a  site  called  in  the  territory;  it  is  probably to  be  located  at  Nikaia  Larisis,  a  site  with  Classical  material (D.  Kontogiannis  ( 1992)  386).  Apollo  Leschaios  was  wor- shipped  in  the  territory  (IG ix.21027  (C 5l)).  On  the  territo- ry,  see  further  Helly  ( 1984). The  resemblance  of  the  C 5  coinage  of  the  Perrhaibians (see  entry  for  Oloosson)  to  that  of  Larisa  (see  infra)  has  been taken  to  indicate  that  Larisa  may  have  brought  the Perrhaibians  into  dependence  upon  itself  (Martin  ( 1985) 72\u00ad73). Early  in  the  Peloponnesian  War,  Larisaian  cavalry  assisted the  Athenians  (Thuc. 2.22.3)  alongside  other  Thessalian poleis  which  were  allied  to Athens.  In  the  390s,  Larisa,  along- side  other  Thessalian  poleis,  was  allied  to  Boiotia  (Xen.  Hell. thessalia  and  adjacent  regions  695 4.3.3).  In  404,  forces  from  Larisa  and  other  unspecified Thessalian  polities  were  defeated  by  Lykophron  I  of  Pherai, who  struggled  for  pan-Thessalian  hegemony  (Xen.  Hell. 2.3.4).  The  conflict c ontinued  into  the  390s,  when,  during the  Corinthian  War,  Medeios  of  Larisa  was  supported  by the anti-Spartan  alliance  (Diod. 14.82.5  (r 395))  and  captured Pharsalos.  In  369,  the  Aleuadai  of  Larisa  called  in  the Makedonian  king  Alexander  II  to support  them  in  their struggle  with  Alexander  of  Pherai;  the  king,  however,  took the  city  by  force  and  placed  a  garrison  on  the  acropolis (Diod. 15.61.3\u00ad5),  a  garrison  which  was  withdrawn  at  the arrival  of  Theban  troops  under  Pelopidas  (Diod. 15.67.4 (r 369/8)).  In  357/6,  the  Aleuadai  again  called  upon  the  king of  Makedon,  Philip  II,  who  responded  favourably  and  thus started  his  interference  in  Greek  politics  (Diod. 16.14.2). During  the  crisis  of 330\u00ad324,  Larisa  received  50,000  med- imnoi  of  grain  from  Kyrene  (Tod  196.8).  A  man  from  Larisa is  listed  in  an  Athenian  catalogue  of  mercenaries  (IG ii\u00b2 1156.i.61\u00ad63  (c. 300)). A  refugee  is  attested  in  399  by  Arist.  Pol. 1311b17;as  tagos  of Thessalia,  Polyphron  II  of  Pherai  ( 370/69)  had  many  citizens of  Larisa  sent  into  exile  (Xen.  Hell. 6.4.34).  Reception  of envoys,  sent  by  Agesilaos  of  Sparta  during  his  march  home from  Asia  Minor  in  394,  is  recorded  in  Plut.  Ages. 16;  the Larisaians,  allied  to  Sparta's  enemies,  arrested  these  envoys, who  were  released  only  after  a  truce  had  been  negotiated. Citizens  of  Larisa  were  appointed  proxenoi  by  Delphi  in 342/1  (F.Delphes iii.4378)  and  333/2  (F.Delphes iii.1401),  by Lamia  in  C 4l  (IG ix.260),  and  by  Gonnoi  in  C 4l/C3e (Gonnoi ii  1);  but  note  that  Aristonous  of  Larisa  (for  whom see  Thuc. 2.22.3)  was,  presumably,  appointed  proxenos  by Athens  c. 430  (IG i\u00b3  55  with  Walbank  ( 1978)  158\u00ad66)  and  that IG ii\u00b2  39.13  ( 379/8)  has  been  restored  [ ]  [ ], which,  if  accepted,  is  an  Athenian  grant  of  proxeny  to  four citizens  of  Larisa. A  mass  grant  of  citizenship  by  Larisa  seems  to  be  implied by  Arist.  Pol. 1275b29ff  (Helly  ( 1984)  229).  Residence  of  free non-citizens  is  implied  by  Pl.  Meno 70B.  Grants  of  citizen- ship  to  citizens  of  Larisa  are  attested  by  F.Delphes iii.4378 ( 342/1);  IG ii\u00b2  558  (c. 303/2),  and  IG ix.260  (C 4l)  (Lamia).  IG iv\u00b2.194b.5  ( 360\u00ad359)  lists  a  citizen  of  Larisa  as  theorodokos  of Epidauros.  A  monetary  donation  by  Larisa  to  \"theoroi  sent out  from  Argos  to  announce  the  celebration  of  the  Nemean Games  and  the  Heraia\"  is  recorded  by  IG iv  617.6  ( 316\u00ad293); Perlman  ( 2000)  74\u00ad75,  127\u00ad29. According  to  Arist.  Pol. 1305b22\u00ad30  and 1306a20\u00ad30,Larisa was  an  oligarchy;  the  most  powerful  family  was  that  of  the Aleuadai  (RE  i. 2.  1372\u00ad74;Helly ( 1995)  112\u00ad24),  who  domi- nated  Larisaian,  and  Thessalian,  politics  for  long  periods.  A board  of  demiourgoi  is  implied  by  Arist.  Pol. 1275b29;  polito- phylakes  are  mentioned  at  Pol. 1305b29:  they  were elected  by the  assembly  (ibid.).  An  \u00b5  in,  possibly,  C 4m (cf.  Dem. 18.48;  but  see  Martin  ( 1985)  255\u00ad60)  is  mentioned at  Pol. 1306a28\u00ad30.A stasis  is  attested  for  C 5l  (Xen.  An. 1.1.10; RE  xii. 850);  one  faction  in  this  stasis  may  have  sought  the support  of  Archelaos  of  Makedon:  Thrasymachos  fr. 2,  DK, obviously  suggests  Makedonian  interference  at  Larisa (Westlake  ( 1935)  51ff;  Hammond  and  Griffith ( 1979)  140\u00ad41; Martin  ( 1985)  89).  Further  outbreaks  of  stasis  are  attested  in 370/69  (Xen.  Hell. 6.4.34)  and  c. 344/3  (Arist.  Pol. 1306a26\u00ad30; Callim.  fr. 588,  Pfeiffer;  cf.  Gehrke,  Stasis 189\u00ad97). At Pol. 1331a30ff,  Aristotle  describes  as  Thessalian  the institution  of  the  eleuthera agora:  that  is,  an  agora  from which  artisans  and  traders  were  banned  and  to  which  they could  have  access  only  if  invited  by  the  magistrates.  An eleuthera agora  may  have  been  identified at Larisa,  south  of the  acropolis  (Tziaphalias  ( 1994b)  158\u00ad59,  169\u00ad70,  173\u00ad74,  cf. plan 155).  A  \"commercial  agora\"  was  probably  located  to the west  on  the  bank  of  the  river  Peneios  (Tziaphalias  ( 1994b) 159,  plan 155).  A  C 4  amphora  stamp  ( ) indicates trade  (SEG 35  635). A  temple  of  Athena  on  the  acropolis  is  mentioned  by Antiochos  (FGrHist 29)  fr. 2;  in  it  was  the  grave  of  the  myth- ical  founder  of  the  city,  Akrisios  (cf.  schol.  Ap.  Rhod. 1.40; Paus. 2.16.2);  on  the  acropolis  are  traces  of  a  Classical  road and  remains  of  buildings  constructed  in  mudbrick (Tziaphalias  ( 1994b)  157\u00ad58);  there  are  no  remains  of  a  sepa- rate  fortification of  the  acropolis,  but  at  15.61.4  (r 369/8) Diodorus  mentions  a  siege  of  the  acropolis  which  suggests that  it  was  fortified. The  teichos  is  mentioned  by  Diod. 15.61.4  (r 369).  The undated  circuit  wall  runs  for  some  4,000  m,  but  is  not known  for  its  entire  course,  and  accordingly  the  area enclosed  by  it  cannot  be  estimated.  The  wall  is  constructed in  mudbrick  on  a  stone  socle  (Tziaphalias  ( 1994b)  177\u00ad78, plan 155).  Since  the  ancient  city  is  overlaid  by  the  modern, not  many  remains  are  visible,  and  it  cannot  be  ascertained whether  it  was  built  on  a  grid  plan  (ibid. 158).  In  the  city  are remains  of  what  was  probably  a  C 4  Doric  temple  of  Apollo Kerdoios;  here  public  documents  were  displayed  (ibid. 169\u00ad70).  The  cemeteries  span  the  period  from  C 5  onwards (ibid. 177\u00ad78). Attested  cults  include  those  of  Athena  Polias  (IG ix.2  592 (C 3),  but  cf.  Antiochos  (FGrHist 29)  fr. 2),  Apollo  Leschaios (supra),  Dionysos  Karpios  (SEG 35  590  ( 450\u00ad425)),  Enodia Wastika  (IG ix.2575  ( 450\u00ad425)),  Gaia  (SEG 29  533  (C 4)), 696 decourt,  nielsen,  helly  et  al. Herakles  (IG ix.2  580  (C 4)),  Poseidon  Patroios  (SEG 35  647, 650  (both  c. 300)),  and  Zeus  Thaulios  (SEG 35  613  (c. 300)). Three  citizens  of  Larisa  achieved  Olympic  victories: Echekratidas  in  464  (Olympionikai 258),  Lykos  in  452 (Olympionikai 281)  and  Krokinas  in  404  and 396 (Olympionikai 351,  367a).  In  366\u00ad338,  Epikrates  of  Larisa won  the  pentathlon  for  ageneioi  at  the  Amphiaraia  at Oropos  (IG vii  414.14);  Lykormas  was  victorious  at  the Pythian  Games  in  310  (Paus. 10.7.8). Several  citizens  of  Larisa  served  the  Amphiktyonic League  as  naopoioi  (CID ii  10A.i.7  ( 357/6);  31.73,  96  ( 345/4); 32.3  ( 341/40),  etc.).  After  the  Third  Sacred  War,  the Larisaians  rented  one  of  the  houses  confiscated from e xiled pro-Phokian  Delphians  (CID ii  68.i.13  and ii.14  ( 338\u00ad330)). Larisa  was  the  first Thessalian polity t o  strike  coins.  The earliest  silver  issues  of  drachms,  triobols,  trihemiobols  and obols  antedate  the  Persian  War  and  are  on  the  Persian  stan- dard  (Lavva  ( 2001)  42).Types:  obv.  horse  biting  its  foreleg,  or head  of  Jason,  or  head  of  nymph,  or  bull's  head,  or  horse- man  with  two  spears;  rev.  sandal  of  Jason  (sometimes  with double  axe  above)  in  incuse  square,  or  horse's  head  in  incuse square,  or  bearded  male  figure seated in incuse square; legends: ,  ,  ,  , (Head,  HN \u00b2298;Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 1  nos. 1410\u00ad16;Kraay ( 1976)  115;  SNG  Cop.  Thessaly 89\u00ad92;Martin ( 1985)  34\u00ad35). Immediately  after  the  Persian  War  the  city  switched  to  the Aiginetan  standard  and  initially  used  the  same  types  and even  the  same  dies  (cf.  SNG  Cop.  Thessaly  on  no. 89).  From this  point  onwards  until  its  issues  ceased  c. 320  (Martin ( 1985)  52,  163),  Larisa  was  the  most  important  mint  of Thessalia  and  struck  didrachms,  drachms,  triobols,  diobols, trihemiobols,  obols  and  hemiobols.  Obv.  types  depict  youth restraining  bull,  horseman,  horse  (C 5);  head  of  nymph Larisa,  or  running  bull  (C 4),etc.;  rev.  types  depict  free  horse, seated  nymph  Larisa,  or  Asklepios  (C 5,  in  incuse  square); and  galloping  horse  or  galloping  horseman,  etc.;  legends: ,  ,  ,  ,  , ,  .  Some  coins  of  c. 370\u00ad360 carry  on  the  rev.  the  inscription  in  tiny  script,  but the  significance of  the  inscription  is  unclear  (Martin  ( 1985) 103;  cf.  Martin  ( 1983)  13\u00ad16);  another  C 4  issue  has  obv.  male head (i.e.  presumably  a  depiction  of  Aleuas  the Red);  rev.  eagle  on  fulmen  and ;the message  intended  is  disputed,  see  Helly  ( 1995)  119\u00ad20  (Head, HN \u00b2298\u00ad99;  SNG  Cop.

For  similarities  between  the  C 5 coins  with  obv.  youth  restraining  bull;  rev.  horse,  and  con- temporary  coins  of  Krannon,  the  Perrhaibians,  Pharkadon, Trikka,  Pherai  and  Skotoussa,  see  Kraay  ( 1976)  115\u00ad16  and Martin  ( 1985)  36\u00ad37. The  bronze  issues  of  Larisa  began  c. 400:  obv.  head  of fountain  nymph  Larisa;  rev.  horse  trotting  or  feeding,  or horseman  with  petasos  and  lance,  or  head  of  Asklepios, bearded  and  laureate;  various  letters,  symbols  and  mono- grams;  legends: ,  (Head,  HN \u00b2297\u00ad99;Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 1  nos. 1009\u00ad18,  ii. 4 nos. 367\u00ad410;  SNG  Cop.

", "Pharsalos": "Identifier: 415. , (Pharsalios) Map  55.Lat.39.15,long.22.20. Size of  territory: 3.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is  , (Pherecydes  (FGrHist 3)  fr. 1;  Thuc. 1.111.1;Xen.  Hell. 6.1.8). The  regular  city-ethnic  is  (Xen.  Hell. 4.3.3; I.Thessalie 56  (C 4);  and  on  coins,  infra),  though  Hippoc. Epid. 6.8.18  has ;  is  found  in  Hdn. iii.1123.8. Pharsalos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Thuc. 1.111.1,  and  in  Ps.-Skylax  64  Pharsalos  is  the  fifth of  nine toponyms  listed  between  the  heading     and  the addendum        ;  asty  is found  in  Anac.  fr. 107,  Diehl  (see  Helly  ( 1995)  43\u00ad44).  Polis  in the  political  sense  is  found  in  Xen.  Hell. 6.1.5  and  implicitly at  Thuc. 2.22.3.  In  the  C 4  dedication  I.Thessalie 56  polis  is restored:  [ ]\u00b5    [ ];the earliest cer- tain  epigraphical  reference  to a   is  in  a  C 3 decree  (I.Thessalie 50).  Arist.  Pol. 1306a11  has  the  phrase    ;  is  found  at  Xen.  Hell. 6.4.34, and in  I.Thessalie 57.4  ( 330s);  CEG ii  795  ( 330s);  Xen. Hell. 6.1.13. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  C 5\u00adC4  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2  306)  and  in  I.Thessalie 56  (C 4), and  externally  in  the  Delphic  naopoioi's  accounts  of 357/6 (CID ii  8.i.8),  in  a  dedication  at  Delphi  (SEG 1210  (C 4m)), and  in  Thuc. 2.22.3.The  external  and  individual  use  is  found in  Thuc. 8.92.8;  IG ii\u00b2  26  ( 394\u00ad387);  and  CID ii.4.i.31  (c. 360). Pharsalos  was  situated  in  Thessalia  (Thuc. 1.111.1),  more precisely  in  Phthiotis  (Strabo  9.5.3,  10;  Kip  ( 1910)  68).  The territory is  referred  to as  at  Thuc. 1.111.1;  it  was  bounded to  the  north-east  by  the  territory  of  Skotoussa  and  Eretria Phthiotis  (Strabo  10.1.10  says  explicitly  that  Eretria  was  near Pharsalos,  and  Polyb. 5.9.3  that  it  was  near  Thebai Phthiotis),  to  the  south  by  the  territories  of  Peuma  and Proerna;  and  to  the  west  by  that  of  Euhydrion.  In  the  territo- ry  were  the  rivers  of  Apidanos  (Thuc. 4.78.5),  Enipeus (Strabo  9.5.6)  and  Louerchos  (I.Thessalie 50).  The Thetideion  was  situated  near  the  eastern  border  of  the Pharsalion  pedion  (Eur.  Andr. 16  with  Decourt  ( 1990) 205\u00ad8),  and  it  was  most  probably  the  same  (on  the  other bank  of  the  Enipeus)  for  the  place  called  Palaipharsalos  by Strabo  9.5.6,  17.1.11  (Decourt  ( 1990)  200\u00ad23).  Two  other toponyms  are  known,  but  not  precisely  located:  Makouniai 702 decourt,  nielsen,  helly  et  al. (I.Thessalie 50  (C 3l)),  possibly  near  modern  Rizi;  and Makkarai  (Theopomp.  fr. 55);  they  may  refer  to  the  same place.  The  ruins  called  Hellas  by Strabo  9.5.6  were,  in  his  day, 60  stades  from  Pharsalos,  with  the  two  springs  of  Messe\u00efs and  Hypereia  close  to them.  When  Philip  II  of  Makedon  had destroyed  Halos,  it  was  handed  over  to  Pharsalos  (Dem. 11.1 with  schol.). The  political  system  of  Pharsalos  was  clearly  a  narrow  oli- garchy:  \u00b5  \u00b5  (Thuc. 4.78.3), \u00b5   (Arist.  Pol. 1305b;  cf. 1306a11\u00ad12); and  some  families,  especially  the  Daochids  and  the Menonids  (on  whom  see  Larsen  ( 1968)  22),  are  well  known from  the  literary  and  epigraphical  record  (on  Daochids  see, e.g.,  B\u00e9quignon  ( 1970)  1053\u00ad56;Helly ( 1995)  51\u00ad52,  63\u00ad67;on Menonids:  Helly  ( 1995)  233\u00ad35,  263\u00ad64,  303\u00ad6).  A  stasis  is mentioned  by  Xen.  Hell. 6.1.2,and  this  conflict seems t o  have been  solved  by  granting  exceptional  powers  to  a  single  indi- vidual,  Polydamas  (Gehrke,  Stasis 126),  who  was  subjected to  an  annual  rendering  of  accounts  (Hell. 6.1.2:  '   ).  A  set  of  laws  ( \u00b5) that specified ( inter  alia?)  public  incomes  is  referred  to at  Xen. Hell. 6.1.2. The  Thessalian  cavalry  took  part  in  the  Lelantine  War under  the  Pharsalian  Kleomachos  (Arist.  fr. 98,  Rose).  The city  was  attacked  by  Athenians  with  allies  in  457/6,  but  these forces  did  not  manage  to  capture  the  city  (Thuc. 1.111.1). Cavalry  and  an  anonymous  cavalry  commander  from Pharsalos  are  attested  in  Thuc. 2.22.3,  when  the  city  was allied  with  Athens  (alongside  other  Thessalian  cities);  a  hip- parchos  is  also  mentioned  at  Xen.  Hell. 4.3.8  and  polemarchoi in  SEG 1210  (C 4m).  With  Larisa,  Krannon  and  Skotoussa, Pharsalos  is  mentioned  as  being  allied  with  the  Boiotians  in 395/4  (Xen.  Hell. 4.3.3).  In  374,  Polydamas  failed  to  gain  help from  Sparta  and  accordingly  had  to  ally  Pharsalos  with Jason  of  Pherai  (Xen.  Hell. 6.1.19);  as  tagos,  Polyphron  II  of Pherai  had  nine  citizens  of  Pharsalos,  including  Polydamas, executed  (Xen.  Hell. 6.4.34).  A  war  against  Pelinna(ion)  in the  time  of  Philip  II  is  mentioned  in  Polyaen. 4.2.19; Pharsalos  was  allied  with  Philip  II  of  Makedon  against  the Achaian  city  of  Halos  (Dem. 11.1;Strabo 9.5.8),  and Kottyphos  of  Pharsalos  was  the  strategos  of  the Amphiktyonic  League  against  Amphissa  (Aeschin. 3.128). Pharsalian  cavalry  fought  with  Alexander  the  Great  in  Asia (Arr.  Anab. 3.10.11). According  to Diod. 14.82.6,  Pharsalos,  though  garrisoned by  Lakedaimonians,  was  captured  by  Medios  of  Larisa  in 395,  and  the  inhabitants  (      ) were  sold  off  as  booty  ( ).  Medios  may  have placed  a  mercenary  garrison  in  Pharsalos  after  his  capture  of the  city:  Arist.  Hist.  an. 618b13\u00ad14  refers  to \"the  time  when Meidios'  mercenaries  were  killed  at  Pharsalos\". In 374  Pharsalos  may  have  ruled  over  an  unknown  num- ber  of  unidentifiable but presumably minor poleis:at  Hell. 6.1.8  Xenophon  has  Jason  of  Pherai  state  that  if  he  is  joined by  Pharsalos  and        \u00b5  (sc.  ) \u00b5   he  will  easily  become  tagos  of  Thessalia. Thessalian  allies  of  Pharsalos  are  implied  by  Polyaen. 4.2.19 (r  time  of  Philip  II). Thoukydides  of  Pharsalos  was  proxenos  of  Athens  (Thuc. 8.92.8),  and  Polydamas  was  hereditary  proxenos  of  Sparta (Xen.  Hell. 6.1.4);in  C 4  Daochos  was  proxenos  of  Anaphe  (IG xii.3251  (c. 345\u00ad330)),  and  Iphitos  was  honoured  by  Athens (IG ii\u00b2  26).  Reception  of  an  Athenian  embassy  seems implied  by  Ar.  Vesp. 1271. The  patron  divinity  of  Pharsalos  was  probably  Zeus: Olympios  (I.Thessalie 58  (C 4e));  Soter  (ibid. i59  (C 3l)  and 60  (C 3s))  or  Thaulios  (ibid. i62\u00ad63  (C 4)).  The  Pharsalians also  had  cults  of  Aphrodite  Peitho  (ibid. i67  ( 450\u00ad430)), Apollo  (ibid. i65  (C 4s)),  Artemis  (ibid. i66  (C 3)),  Athena (coins,  infra;  cf.  Lavva  ( 2001)  31\u00ad32,stressing  the  importance of  this  goddess),  Demeter  (Daffa-Nikonanou  ( 1973)  27\u00ad28), Hestia  and  Symmachos  (I.Thessalie 68  (C 4f)),  Hermes (ibid. i69  (C 5m)),  Pan  and  the  Nymphs  (ibid. i72  (C 5f),  73 (C 4)).  The  locations  of  the  cult  sites  are  uncertain,  except that  of  Pan  and  the  Nymphs  in  the  so-called  Alogopati  grot- to (ibid. i72\u00ad73)  and  perhaps  that  of  Demeter  at  Ambelia Pharsalou  (ArchDelt 43B1:  273  (C 6l\u00adC5m)),  and,  of  course, the  Thetideion  (supra);  the  Thetideion  is  actually  called  a polis  by  Pherecydes  (FGrHist 3)  fr. 1a,  but  in  a  purely  mytho- logical  context  and  without  implications  for  its  status  in  the Classical  period  (cf.  Hansen  and  Nielsen  ( 2000)  148\u00ad49). Several  Pharsalians  are  known  as  victors  in  the Panhellenic  games:  in  the  Olympic  Games  victories  were won  by  Phaidros  (Olympionikai 107,in  556)  and  Agias (Olympionikai 192,in  484);  Pythian  victories  were  won  by Agias  (I.Thessalie 57,in  c. 490\u00ad480)  and  Telemachos (Olympionikai 190  (C 5));  and  Agias  and  Telemachos  were both  periodonikai  (Knab  ( 1934)  nos. 11\u00ad12).  In  366\u00ad338, Melanippos  of  Pharsalos  was  victorious  in  the  hoplite  race at  the  Amphiaraia  at  Oropos  (IG vii  414.27\u00ad28). I.Thessalie 56  (C 4)  is  an  internal  communal  dedication, while  SEG 1210  (C 4m)  is  a  dedication  to  Pythian  Apollo. Donations  of  money  to  Delphi  and  Argos  are  attested  in CID ii  8.i.8  (C 4m)  and  IG iv  617  ( 316\u00ad293).  Citizens  of Pharsalos  served  the  Amphiktyonic  League  in  various capacities:  as  argyrologos  (CID ii  11A.5,B.6);  hieromnemon thessalia  and  adjacent  regions  703 (CID ii  32.42,  89.6,  94.2);  naopoios  (CID ii  31.72,  32.30,  33.8, 74.I.66\u00ad67,  79A.i.9,  95.6)  and  tamias  (CID ii  74.i.42,  77.i.4). The  acropolis  of  Pharsalos  is  mentioned  by  Xen.  Hell. 6.1.2,  18;  it  was  located  on  the  Profitis Ilias hill,  and  was  c. 500 m  long  (east\u00adwest)  and  50  m  wide;  the  preserved  walls  are  all Byzantine.  The  upper  (c. 750  400  m)  and  the  lower  (c. 1,500 1,200  m)  town  were  situated  on  the  northern  slope  of  the hill  and  in  the  plain  near  the  Apidanos  spring.  The  walls (polygonal  and  trapezoidal  or  rectangular  isodomic),  not well  preserved  except  near  the  acropolis  itself,  are  between 2.70  m  and  4.0  m  wide.  There  are  remains  of  four  gates  and a  postern,  as  well  as  at  least  twenty-four  towers.  Part  of  the city  wall  was  constructed  in  C 5e  (cf.  Diod. 11.83.3\u00ad4  for  a poliorkia  in 457/6),  but  most  of  it  dates  to C 4s  (St\u00e4hlin ( 1924a)  139\u00ad41;  Katakouta  and  Toufexis  ( 1994)).A  C 6l  tholos tomb  was  found  outside  the  circuit  wall  (Prakt  ( 1951)  155\u00ad63, ( 1952)  185\u00ad202,(1953)  127\u00ad32),  but  almost  nothing  is  known about  the  degree  of  urbanisation  during  the  Archaic  and Classical  periods:  some  houses  have  been  excavated,  but they  all  date  to  the  Hellenistic  or  Roman  periods  (see  further Lavva  ( 2001)  4\u00ad10).An  extensive  Archaic-Classical  cemetery is  located  west  of  the  city  (ibid. 9). Pharsalos  struck  coins  in  silver  on  the  Aiginetan  standard and  bronze  between  c. 480  and  c. 320.  Denominations: drachms,  triobols,  trihemiobols,  obols,  hemiobols  and  frac- tions  in  bronze  (from  C 5l).

Pherai  is  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  SEG 23  433.5 (C 4)  and  is  listed  as  a  polis  in  this  sense  at  Thuc. 2.22.3;  polis in  the  urban  sense  is  found  in  Dem. 7.32;  at  Ps.-Skylax  64, Pherai  is  the  first t oponym  listed  between  the  heading    and  the  addendum       ;  akropolis  is  found  in  Dem. 7.32. The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  in SEG 23  416.1  ( 450\u00ad425)  and  417.3  (C 5l);  the  external  collec- tive  use  is  found  in  Thuc. 2.22.3;Xen.Hell.6.4.31;  CID ii  1.i.47 ( 362/1);  IG iv  617.4  ( 316\u00ad293);and  the  external  individual  use in  Xen.  Hell. 2.3.4;  CID ii  31.73  ( 345);  IG iv\u00b2.1  122.26  (C 4). Pherai  was  a  Thessalian  community  (IG v.1  948.2  (C 4)), belonging  to  the  tetras  of  Pelasgiotis  (Strabo  9.5.10). Archaeological  material  demonstrates  the  existence  of  sev- eral  military  installations  and  second-order  settlements (often  fortified) in the t erritory  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical periods;  for  details,  see  Di  Salvatore  ( 1994).  Pagasai  is described  as  the  epineion  of  Pherai  by Theopomp.  fr. 53  (see further  the  entry  for  Pagasai,  supra).  A  C 4  decree  (SEG 23 418),  by  extending  privileges  granted  to  [ ]    ,  suggests  that  the  city  controlled  territory other  than  the  civic  territory proper. Early  in  the  Peloponnesian  War,  Pheraian  cavalry  assisted the  Athenians  (Thuc. 2.22.3)  alongside  other  Thessalian poleis  which  were  allied  to  Athens.  The  C 5l\u00adC4  history  of Pherai,  as  it  appears  from  our  sources,  was  dominated  by  a series  of  powerful  individuals  who  struggled  for  pan- Thessalian  hegemony,  made  extensive  use  of  mercenary forces  (Parke ( 1933)  100ff),  and  were referred  to as  tyrannoi (e.g.  Ephor.  fr. 95;Berve ( 1967)  283\u00ad95).The  first of  these  was Lykophron  I,  who  in  404  defeated  the  Larisaians  and  other Thessalians  in  battle  \u00b5      (Xen.  Hell. 2.3.4;  Westlake  ( 1935)  54\u00ad55);  conflict between  Lykophron  and  Larisa  continued  into  the  390s (Diod. 14.81.5  (r 395)),  and  Lykophron  seems  to  have  had Spartan  support  (Xen.  Hell. 6.4.24;  Cartledge  ( 1987)  354; Neue  Pauly  vii. 568).  Nothing  is  known  about  the  end  of Lykophron's  rule;  he  may  have  been  succeeded  by  a  certain Polyalkes,  who  may  have  been  a  relative  of  his  (Westlake ( 1935)  68;Berve ( 1967)  285),  but  his  true  successor  was  his son  (Westlake  ( 1935)  68),  the  famous  Jason  of  Pherai  (on whom  see  Mandel  ( 1980)  and  Sprawski  ( 1999)).  He  appears for  the  first time c. 382\u00ad379,  when  he  assisted  Neogenes  of Histiaia  in  establishing  a  tyranny  (Diod. 15.30.3;  Stylianou ( 1998)  ad  loc.).  By  the  middle  of  the  370s,he  possessed  a  mer- cenary  army of 6,000  foot  and  had  by force  of  arms  subdued not  only  Alketas  of  Epeiros  (Xen.  Hell. 6.1.7;  cf.  Hammond ( 1967)  524  and  Mitchel  ( 1984)  57\u00ad58)  but  also  most  of  the poleis  of  Thessalia  and  made  them  symmachoi  (Xen.  Hell. 6.1.5).  During  the  fighting,  he  was  regularly  opposed  by Pharsalos  (ibid.),  but  Pharsalos  itself  (presumably  with  its dependent  poleis)  was  made  a  symmachos  not  by force  of arms  but  by  negotiation  (Xen.  Hell. 6.1.2\u00ad18),  after  a Pharsalian  plea  for  Spartan  assistance  had  been  rejected (ibid.).  After  this,  presumably  in  375/4,  Jason  was  elected tagos  of  Thessalia  and  went  on  to  organise  the  military  and economic  affairs  of  the  Thessalians  (Xen.  Hell. 6.1.18;Helly ( 1995)  345\u00ad53);  his  command  of  a  fleet of  triremes  is  attested by Xen.  Hell. 6.4.21,  but  it  is  unclear  whether  the  reference  is 704 decourt,  nielsen,  helly  et  al. to  a  Pheraian,  a  Thessalian,  or  even  a  personal  navy.  His extra-Thessalian  policy  seems  to  have  been  to  oppose  Sparta (Xen.  Hell. 6.1.10;  Mandel  ( 1980)  54),  and  he  became  an  ally of  Athens  ([Dem.]  49.10)  and  possibly  a  member  of  the Second  Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.15;  Jehne  ( 1991); Dreher  ( 1995)  173\u00ad74;  see,however,Mitchel ( 1984),  who restores  IG ii\u00b2  43B.1\u00ad2  as  [ ]  [ ]  \u00b5  and  argues that  the  Pheraians  as  such,  and  not  Jason,  were  enrolled  as  a member  of  the  League);  Jason  also  concluded  a  treaty  of symmachia  with  King  Amyntas  of  Makedon  (Diod. 15.60.2; Stylianou  ( 1998)  ad  loc.).  As  an  ally  of  Thebes,  Jason  negotiated  spondai  between  the  Boiotians  and  the Lakedaimonians  after  the  battle  of  Leuktra  (Xen.  Hell. 6.4.19\u00ad25);  on  his  foreign  policy,  see  in  general  Westlake ( 1935)  84\u00ad102.  Jason  was  assassinated  in  370/69  (Xen.  Hell. 6.4.31).  On  his  successors,  see  Westlake  ( 1935)  126\u00ad95  and Berve  ( 1967)  289\u00ad95.In 353/2  the  tyrants  Lykophron  II  and Peitholaos  handed  over  Pherai  to Philip  II  of  Makedon  and left  the  city  (Diod. 16.37.3,  38.1;  on  chronology,  see  Martin ( 1981)).  Peitholaos  may  have  returned  only  to  be  driven  out by  Philip,  according  to  Diod. 16.52.9,  349/8  (Westlake  ( 1935) 183;Berve ( 1967)  294;  Buckler  ( 1989)  106\u00ad7).  In  344,  Philip defeated  a  rebellious  Pherai  and  installed  a  permanent  gar- rison  on  its  acropolis  (Dem.  [ 7.32],8.59,9.12;Westlake  ( 1935) 192). Pherai  made  grants  of  proxeny  to citizens  of  Opous  (SEG 23  415  ( 450\u00ad425);  SEG 420  (C 4)),  Proerna  (SEG 23  416 ( 450\u00ad425)),  Thebes  (SEG 23  417  (C 5l\u00adC4);  SEG 422  (C 4)), Skotoussa  (SEG 23  419  (C 4))  and  Krannon  (SEG 23  421 (C 4)).  F.Delphes iii.4385  ( 338\u00ad320)  is  possibly  a  grant  of proxeny  by Delphi  to a  citizen  of  Pherai. Pheraian  cavalry  are  attested  at  Thuc. 2.22.3  and  Xen.  Hell. 6.4.31  (     ). The  earliest  preserved  public  enactments  are  two  grants of  proxeny  dating  to 450\u00ad425  (SEG 23  415\u00ad16);  the  term [\u00b5] is found in SEG  23  424.6  (C 4).  A  board  of tagoi  is  attested  by  SEG 23  425.6  (C 4).  SEG 23  420  (C 4)  con- tains  a  grant  of to  a  man  of  East  Lokrian  Opous. The  raising  of  taxes  is  implied  by  several  grants  of  (cf.  SEG 23  418,  419,  420,  422,  425  (all  C 4)).  SEG 23  418  (C 4) extends  privileges  granted  to  [ ]   .  Grants  of  epinomia  are  found  in  SEG 23  422  and 424  (both  C 4). There  are  few  remains  of  the  ancient  city  of  Pherai  (RE suppl.  vii. 993\u00ad94;  PECS 702),  the  most  important  being  the remains  of  a  suburban  temple  of  En(n)odia  (or  En(n)odia and  Zeus  Thaulios;  it  was  erected  in  the  Doric  style  in  C 6e (B\u00e9quignon  ( 1937a)  44\u00ad47),  and  rebuilt  in  C 4l  with  a  peri- style  of 6 12  columns  (\u00d8stby  ( 1992),  ( 1994)).  A Dioskoureion  in  the  city  is  mentioned  at  Dem. 19.158  (cf. Chrysostomou  ( 1983)).  A  C 5e  marble  statue  of  Athena  was found  on  the  acropolis,  which  may  indicate  a  sanctuary  of the  goddess  there  (PECS 702). Dem. 8.59  and 10.61  refer  to  the  of  Pherai;  the  city wall  was  constructed  in  C 4f  (Camp  ( 2000)  43);  it  is  3\u00ad5  m thick,  built  of  rough-faced  rectangular  and  trapezoidal blocks  laid  in  fairly  regular  courses  (PECS 702)  and  runs  for c. 5  km;  at  the  Athanassios  hill,  a  gate  and  six  towers  have been  identified (Kakavoyiannis ( 1977));  the  area  enclosed measures  at  least  82  ha  (  the  upper  city)  but  perhaps  as much  as  c. 120  (including  the  lower  city;  M.  Di  Salvatore, pers.  comm.);  to  the  south-west,  there  may  have  been  a  sec- ond  wall;  to  the  south  it  was  an  emplektron  wall  (ArchDelt 50 ( 1995)  B. 1:  363). The  patron  divinity  was  En(n)odia,  who  is  depicted  on  Classical  coins  (infra;  Chrysostomou  ( 1998);  LIMC iii.1744).  Other  cults  include  those  of  Artemis  (IG ix.2 417.2  (C 4)),  the  Dioskouroi  (Dem. 19.158),  Poseidon (Chrysostomou  ( 1998)  249),  Zeus  Thaulios  (B\u00e9quignon ( 1937a)  92,  66.2  (Archaic)),  as  well  as  those  of  Aphrodite, Athena,  Demeter,  Hestia  and  Themis  (Chrysostomou ( 1998)  48\u00ad49). Citizens  of  Pherai  served  the  Amphiktyonic  League  in  the capacities  of  naopoios  (CID ii  31.73,  85  ( 345),  74.i.69  ( 337/6), 75.ii.40  ( 336/5),  etc.)  and  hieromnemon  (CID ii  102.ii.A.25 ( 324/3);  cf. 118.1).  A  monetary  donation  by  Pherai  towards the  rebuilding  of  the  temple  at  Delphi  is  recorded  in  CID ii 1.i.47  ( 362/1)  and  one  to  \"theoroi  sent  out  from  Argos  to announce  the  celebration  of  the  Nemean  Games  and  the Heraia\"  is recorded by IG iv  617.4  ( 316\u00ad293;  Perlman  ( 2000) 74\u00ad75,  127\u00ad29). Pherai  began  minting  silver  coins  in  C 5f,  striking drachms,  triobols,  obols  and  hemiobols  on  the  Aiginetan standard.  Types:  obv.  Thessalian  subduing  bull,  or  head  and neck  of  bull  clasped  by  bull-fighter,  or  bull's  hoof;  rev.horse with  loose  rein  and  lion's  head  fountain  in  incuse  square,  or horse  springing  from  rock  in  incuse  square,  or  naked  rider in  incuse  square,  or  horse's  head  in  incuse  square;  legends: ,,,,.For similarities between  these  coins  and  contemporary  coins  of  Krannon, Larisa,  the  Perrhaibians,  Pharkadon,  Trikka  and  Skotoussa, see  Kraay  ( 1976)  115\u00ad16  and  Martin  ( 1985)  36\u00ad37.  Pherai  may, in  addition,  have  been  the  city  that  struck  coins  in  the  name of  the  Thessalians  c. 470\u00ad450;  see  Kraay  ( 1976)  116  and Martin  ( 1985)  37\u00ad38.

In C 4,  drachms  and  triobols  were  minted:  obv.  head  of nymph  Hypereia,  or  head  of  Ennodia,  or  lion's  head;  rev. Ennodia  with  two  torches  riding  on  a  galloping  horse,  or standing  nymph  Hyperia  with  her  hand  on  lion's  head  foun- tain,  or  lion's  head  fountain;  legends: , .

The  city  remains  unlocated,  though  the  palaiokastro  of Sesklou,  proposed  by  di  Salvatore  ( 1994)  115\u00ad16,  seems  the best  candidate  (infra).  Several  locations  have  been  proposed for  Amphanai.  ( 1)  Soros,  above  Alykes  Volou,  proposed  by e.g.  St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  68;  Indzesiloglou  ( 1994)  46;and Triantophyllopoulou  ( 2000),  followed  by  Barr.  Soros  has commonly  been  identified w ith  Amphanai,  but  recent  exca- vations  (AAA 7  ( 1974)  60\u00ad75)  have  made  it  more  likely  that Soros  is  to  be  identified w ith  Pagasai;  cf.  Marzolff  ( 1994b)  274 n. 10.(2)  Damari  or  Velanidia,  proposed  by  Bakhuizen  ( 1987) 323  n. 2.(3)  Palio-Alikes,  proposed  by  Marzolff  ( 1994a)  70  n. 6.(4)  The  palaiokastro  Sesklou,  proposed  by  di  Salvatore ( 1994)  115\u00ad16.  It  would  be  reasonable  to  begin  by  locating  the harbour.  The  harbour  must  have  been  situated  on  the  south- ern  shore  of  the  peninsula  terminated  by Cap  Ankistri.  The site  most  suitable  for  a  harbour  is  found  at  the  inlet  of  Chrysi Akti  Panaghia  (formerly  Kandir  Aga).  The  urban  centre proper  must  be  sought  in  the  hinterland  at  a  place  which  sat- isfies the socio-economic needs of  the  community;  the  site  at Palio  Alikes  does  not  fulfil this r equirement,  and  the palaiokastro  Sesklou  is  a  preferable  site  within  reasonable  dis- tance  of  the  proposed  location  of  the  harbour. Hekataios  may  have  described  Amphanai  as  a  Dorian  city (FGrHist 1  fr. 3  Steph.  Byz. 89.4\u00ad5),  but  presumably  in  ref- erence  to  the  Heroic  Age  (cf.  Jacoby,  comm.  ad  loc.;  cf.  how- ever Helly ( 2001b),  dating  it  to  the  early  first millennium). Ps.-Skylax 64  puts  it  in  Thessalia  (Pelasgiotis;  cf.  infra  on Pagasai).  Philip  II  of  Makedon  presumably  handed  over Amphanai  (with  Pagasai)  to  the  Magnesians  (see  the  entry for  Pagasai). 394. ", "Pagasai": "Identifier: 408. , (Pagasitas) Map  55.

The  city-ethnic  is (CID ii  100.ii.8  ( 325))  or  (IG iv 617.4  ( 316\u00ad293)). In  Ps.-Skylax 64,  where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense, Pagasai  is  one  of  nine  toponyms  listed  between  the  heading    and  the  addendum       .  Theopomp.  fr. 53  described  it  as  the  epineion  of Pherai  (cf.  Plut.  Them. 20.1).  The  external  collective use  of the  city-ethnic  is  found  in  IG iv  617.4  ( 316\u00ad293),  and  the external  individual  use  in  CID ii  100.ii.8  ( 325). Theopompos'  description  of  Pagasai  as  the  epineion  of Pherai  (FGrHist 115  fr. 53)  does  not  mean  that  it  cannot  have been  a  polis  (Hansen  ( 1997)  36\u00ad37);  the  exact  relationship between  the  two  cities  is  unknown,  but  Pagasai  may  possibly have  been  a  dependent  polis  of  Pherai  serving  as  its  harbour (cf.  ibid.  for  parallels);  or  Theopompos'  statement  may  sim- ply  mean  that  the  city  was  within  the  general  sphere  of Pheraian  influence (a brother of  Jason  resided  there: Polyaen. 6.1.6). Ps.-Skylax 64  describes  Pagasai  as  Thessalian  (cf.  CID ii  100.i.20,  ii.8),  and  Theopompos'  description  of  it  as    puts  it  in  Pelasgiotis  (FGrHist 115  fr. 53). Dem. 1.12,  22,  2.11  (cf.  Ath. 43A;  Polyaen. 6.2.1)  distinguishes between  Pagasai  and  Magnesia,  so  Pagasai  was  accordingly not  Magnesian;  but  in  353  the  city  was  taken  by  Philip  II  (pre- sumably  after  a  siege:  Dem. 1.9)  and  forced  into  submission (    ,Diod.  16.31.6;  cf.  Dem. 1.22,  2.11). Presumably  from  then  on  it  was  regarded  as  Magnesian  and may  have  been  handed  over  to  the  Magnesians  by  Philip  (RE xviii. 2308),  though  according  to  schol.  Dem. 1.22  the incomes  from  the  harbours  and  the  agora  were  given  to Philip  himself;  Philip  probably  installed  a  garrison  at Pagasai  (Martin  ( 1985)  97). Hes.  Scut. 70  mentions  a  bomos  of  Apollo  Pagasaios,  and  a C 5\u00adC4  temple  of  Apollo  and  a  stoa  have  been  found  outside the  circuit  on  the  saddle  south  of  the  acropolis  (Milojcic ( 1974)).  The  rocky  summit  of  the  hill  of  Soros,  the  acropolis of  Pagasai,  was  crowned  by a  presumably  C 6l\u00adC5e  circular wall,  and  the  lower  city  was  surrounded  by  a  contemporary triple  wall  (Prakt  ( 1909)  165\u00ad70)  which  enclosed  an  area  of c. 6\u00ad7  ha.  For  a  plan,  see  Marzolff  ( 1994b)  256  fig. 1.  The  earli- est  indications  of  occupation  are  late  Archaic,  and  there  are no  Hellenistic  sherds  either  in  the  city  proper  or  in  the  extra- mural  sanctuary,  or  in  the  graves  (Triantaphyllopoulou ( 2000)  60),  a  fact  which  fits the r eport  of  its  relocation  to Demetrias  in  293  (Strabo  9.5.15). The  central  social  and  economic  feature  of  Pagasai  was,  it seems,  its  harbour.  In  477/6  a  Delian  League  fleet w intered  at the  harbour  (Plut.  Them. 20.1),  and  Pagasai  was  a  trading port  exporting  grain  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.56),  meat  (Plut.  Mor. 193DE)  and  slaves  (Ar.  Plut. 521;  Hermippos  fr. 63.19  (PCG)). The  cult  of  Apollo  Pagasaios  is  frequently  mentioned  (RE xviii. 2.  2303).  A  cult  of  Poseidon  is  attested  by  a  C 5f  dedica- tion  (ArchEph  ( 1932)  27  no. 12),  and  a  cult  of  Artemis  may  be inferred  from  IG ix.2  1123  (C 3e);  a  cult  of  Dionysos  Pelagios is  attested  in  Theopomp.  fr. 352,  and  Alexander  of  Pherai thessalia  and  adjacent  regions  699 may  possibly  have  been  worshipped  as  a  hero  at  Pagasai  (RE xviii. 2307). IG iv  617.4  ( 316\u00ad293)  records  a  monetary  donation  by  the Pagasaians  \"to  the  sent  out  from  Argos  to announce the  celebration  of  the  Nemean  Games  and  the  Heraia\" (Perlman  ( 2000)  74,  127\u00ad29);  cf.

In  the  Delphic  naopoioi's  accounts  of 362/1  (CID ii  1)  the Trikkaians  are  recorded  ( i.16)  under  the  heading     ( i.11);  Strabo  9.5.17  calls  it  a  phrourion. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  internally  on C 5  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  CID ii  1.i.16  ( 362/1)  and Diod. 18.56.5  (r 319);  the  external  individual  use  is  found  in CID ii  48.i.46  ( 338/7),  79.A.i.46  ( 334/3). Trikka  was  situated  in  Thessalia  (IG iv\u00b2.1128.29  (c. 280); IG xi.4  606  fr.  b. 8  (C 3f)),  more  specifically in H estiaotis (Strabo  9.5.17).  It  is  located  in  north-western  Thessalia  at modern  Trikala.  The  site  was  inhabited  in  the  Archaic  and Classical  periods,  but  the  preserved  building  remains  are  all from  a  later  date  (Tziaphalias  ( 1988)  186\u00ad92). Diod. 18.56.5  reports  that  Trikkaian  exiles  were  explicitly excluded  from  the  general  amnesty  decreed  by Polyperchon in 319,  and  this  suggests  that  the  city  had  followed  a  policy opposed  to  Philip  II  of  Makedon  (Martin  ( 1985)  104; Hammond  ( 1994)  48).  Nothing  further  is  known  about these  exiles,  but  their  very  existence  indicates  a  defined body of  citizens. The  patron  divinity  was  Asklepios,  who,  according  to Strabo,  was  born  at  Trikka  ( 14.1.39)  and  there  had  his  oldest and  most  famous  sanctuary  ( 9.5.17);  the  Asklepieion  has  not yet  been  identified ( Tziaphalias  ( 1988)  188\u00ad92).  Coin  types (infra)  suggest  cults  of  Athena  and  the  eponymous  nymph.

No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Angeia  a  polis;but in the  Delphic  naopoioi's  accounts  the  are recorded in  a  fragmentary  list  (CID ii  8.ii.16),  the  heading  of  which undoubtedly  included  the  formula   \u00b5  (cf.

Angeia  was  a  Dolopian  community (IG ii\u00b2  1132.59  (C 2)),  but  it  apparently  did  not  provide  the Amphiktyonic  League  with  Dolopian  hieromnemones  in  C 4 when  these  were  provided  by  Ktimene  (Lef\u00e8vre  ( 1998)  85).

Ktimene  was  a  Dolopian  community  (CID ii  74.i.49;Ap. Rhod. 1.68)  and  as  such  sometimes  provided  the Amphiktyonic  League  with  the  Dolopian  hieromnemon (CID ii  32.45  (C 4l)).

The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  in  IG ix.23a.1  (C 4)  and  on  C 4f  coins  (infra).

The  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  only  in Hellenistic  sources,  e.g.  F.Delphes iii.4363.2  ( 225\u00ad210). Hypata  was  an  Ainian  city  (Arist.  Mir.  ausc. 843b16).At  the site  are  remains  of  an  acropolis  wall  (B\u00e9quignon  ( 1937b) with  fig. 13)  and  a  circuit  wall,  certain  parts  of  which  date  to C 4\u00adC3  (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  211;  B\u00e9quignon  ( 1937b)  310\u00ad11). Inside  the  walls  are  undated  remains  of  walls  (B\u00e9quignon ( 1937b)  310). A  C 4  grant  of  proxeny  (along  with  epinomia  and  enktesis) by  Hypata  is  recorded  in  IG ix.23a,  which  also  attests  to  the existence  of  a  board  of ( 3a.4). Coin  types  suggest  cults  of  Zeus  and  Athena;  Hermes  is attested  by  IG ix.231  (Hell.?).

Prt. 343A). According  to  Diog.  Laert. 1.107\u00ad8,  the  location  of  Chen  was subject  to  dispute  already  in  Antiquity,  but  there  is  a  reason- ably  consistent  tradition  associating  it  with  the  area  of  Oita and  Malis  (Diod. 9.6;  Paus. 10.24.1;Diog.  Laert. 1.106).  Its only  claim  to inclusion  in  this  Inventory  is  the  existence  of an  ethnic  closely  related  to  the  toponym  and  used  as  a  part  of Myson's  name  as  early  as  Plato  (Prt. 343A);  such  a  usage  is often  indicative  that  the  site  to  whose  toponym  the  ethnic  is related  was  a  polis  (Hansen  ( 1996)  182\u00ad87),  especially  in external  contexts.  If /  is  not  a  sub-ethnic (ibid. 171\u00ad73,  182),  then  Chen  was  possibly  a  polis.However, /may very well  be  a  sub-ethnic:  our  sources consistently  describe  Chen  as  a  kome  (Diod. 9.6;  Paus. 10.24.1;Diog.

No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Parasopioi  a  polis (Strabo  8.6.24,  9.2.23  calls  it  a  kome  in  reference  to his  own day);  but  it  may  be  included  as  a  probable  polis  here  on account  of  two  Delphic  grants  of  proxeny  to  men  from  the community:  F.Delphes iii.1  118  is  a  grant  of 324/3  to  a  man described  as  ,  and  F.Delphes iii.2183  one  of c. 300  to  an  [ ]     .

No  city-ethnic  is  attested.  At  7.176.2, Herodotos  describes  Anthele  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense;  at 7.200.2,  however,  he  describes  it  as  a  kome  associated  with the  sanctuary  of  Demeter  Amphiktyonis.  There  is  no  obvi- ous  explanation  for  these  two  different  classifications (Hansen  ( 2000)  197),  and  there  is  no  evidence  either  to  sup- port or to  reject Herodotos'  polis  classification.  Hdt. 7.216 implicitly  places  Anthele  in  Malis.  For  the  site,  see B\u00e9quignon  ( 1937b)  181\u00ad91;  Thalmann  ( 1980). 428.Antikyre  (Antikyritas) Map  55.  Lat. 38.50,long. 22.25.  Size  of  territory: 2.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is ,  (Hdt. 7.198.2).  The  city-ethnic  is   in  Hdt. 7.214.1,  8.21.1,or (IG ix.1  227  (C 2m)). The  only  Classical  source  to  mention  Antikyre  is  Herodotos, who  at  7.198.2  calls  it  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense,  and  at  7.214.1 and 8.21.1  applies  the  city-ethnic  to  two  individuals  of  the city. Antikyre  has  not  yet  been  securely  located,  but  it  was  in Malis  (Hdt. 7.198.1\u00ad2)  and  most  probably  lay  on  the  south- ern  bank  of  the  river  Spercheios,  between  Komma  and Phrantzi,  upstream  from  the  confluence w ith  the thessalia  and  adjacent  regions  709 Gorgopotamos,  possibly  at  Kostalexi  (B\u00e9quignon  ( 1937b) 305\u00ad6;  Kase  ( 1991)  78,  followed  by Barr.). 429.

Echinos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skylax  62 (cf.  Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  145,  154),  but  apart from  that  the  earliest  references  to  a   '  are SEG 25  642  (C 2f)  and  Polyb. 9.42.1  (r 210).  The  C 3  poet Rhianos  (FGrHist 265)  fr. 34  uses about  Echinos.  The external  and  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  in  CID ii  67.27,  71.28  (C 4s).  The  external  and  individual  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  in  F.Delphes iii.4377  ( 346).  IG iv  617.2 ( 316\u00ad293)  records  a  monetary  donation  by  Echinos  \"to  the sent  out  from  Argos  to announce  the  celebration  of the  Nemean  Games  and  the  Heraia\"  (Perlman  ( 2000)  74, 127\u00ad29). Not  much  is  known  about  the  history  of  Echinos: F.Delphes iii.4377  Syll. \u00b3  222  ( 346)  is  a  grant  of  proxeny  by Delphi  to  an  Echinian,  and  Dem. 9.34  implies  Theban  con- trol  of,  or  influence at,  Echinos  in  the  time  of  Philip  II, brought  to  an  end  by  Philip. Echinos  was  situated  in  Malis  according  to  Ps.-Skylax  62; the  territory  is  described  as   \u00b5  by Polyb. 9.41.11. The  urban  history  of  Archaic/Classical  Echinos  is  unknown, most  remains  being  Hellenistic;  but  a  piece  of  isodomic  cir- cuit  wall  undoubtedly  dates  from  C 4  (ArchDelt 43  ([ 1988] 1992)  B. 1:  211\u00ad16).  According  to  Demetrios  of  Kallatis (FGrHist 85)  fr. 6  (apud  Strabo  1.3.20),  Echinos  suffered  ter- ribly  from  an  earthquake,  presumably  the  one  in  426  (Fossey ( 1990)  183\u00ad84). 430.  Herakleia  (Herakle(i)otes) Map  55.  Lat. 38.50,long. 22.25.  Size  of  territory: 2.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is `  (Thuc. 3.92.6;Xen.

Hist.  pl. 4.15.2),    (Thuc. 3.92.1; Diod. 15.57.2  (r 370)),    (Thuc. 4.78.1),  or   (Diod. 14.38.4  (r 399))  vel  sim.  The  city-ethnic  is `  (Thuc. 5.51.2;Xen.  Hell. 6.5.23;  CID ii  32.49 (C 4l)),  or  `  (CID ii  36.i.9  ( 340s)),  distin- guished  from  that  of  homonyms  by  the  addition  of  (Thuc. 5.51.1). Herakleia  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Thuc. 3.92.6,  93.1  and  Hermippos  fr. 4.21,  West;  it  is  called  \u00b5 at  Strabo  9.4.13;  polis  in  the  political  sense  is  found  at  Thuc. 3.92.4,  5.51.1\u00ad2;  it  is  called  at  Thuc. 3.92.1. The  C 4e  coin  legend  (infra)  is  presumably  an abbreviation  of  the  internal  collective  city-ethnic;  the  exter- nal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  at  Thuc. 5.51.1\u00ad2; Xen.  Hell. 3.5.6,6.5.23;  and  IG iv  617.1  ( 316\u00ad293).The  external individual  use  is  found  at,  e.g.,  CID ii  36.i.9,  35  ( 340s). Herakleia  was  founded  in  426  by  the  Lakedaimonians (Thuc. 3.92.1),  who  provided  the  three  oecists  Leon,  Alkidas and  Damagon  (Thuc. 3.92.5).  Pressed  in  war  by  the  Oitaians ( \u00b5   \u00b5:  Thuc. 3.92.2;       ... \u00b5   :Diod. 12.59.4),  the  Trachinians  (one  of  the  three  mere  of  the Malians;  cf.  the  entry  on  Trachis  infra)  and  the  Dorians  of central  Greece  had  sent  an  embassy  to  Lakedaimon  (Thuc. 3.92.2\u00ad3).  Neither  Thucydides  nor  Diodorus  states  exactly what  was  asked  of  the  Lakedaimonians  (cf.  Malkin  ( 1994) 221),  but  they  decided  to grant  help  in  the  form  of  a  colony (Thuc. 3.92.4)  and  proceeded  to  consult  the  Delphic  oracle, which  recommended  the  foundation  (Thuc. 3.92.5).  The settlers  were  drawn  from  the  Spartans  themselves,  from  the perioikoi  and  from  other  Hellenes  to the  exclusion  of  certain ethne  such  as  the  Achaians  and  the  Ionians  (Thuc. 3.92.5); Diod. 12.59.4  says  that  the  settlers  were  drawn  from Lakedaimonians,  Peloponnesians  and  other  Hellenes. Thuc. 3.92.6  presumably  means  that  Herakleia  was  a  new foundation  (cf.  HCT  ad  loc.;  Malkin  ( 1994)  221),and  Strabo's statement  that  Herakleia  was  6  stades  from  the  site  of Trachis  ( 9.4.13)  confirms this if  the  reference  is  to the  origi- nal  site;  however,  Diod. 12.59.3  says  that  Trachis  was renamed  Herakleia  (cf.  Strabo  9.4.13)  whereby  he  possibly means  to  locate  the  city  at  the  site  of  Trachis.  If  Strabo's statement  about  the  location  of  Herakleia  is  accepted  as referring  to the  original  site,  then  Diodorus  must  be  wrong, or  his  statement  about  the  renaming  must  be  taken  to  refer to  the  community,  not  the  site,  of  old  Trachis.  That  would indicate  that  the  Trachinians  themselves  were  enrolled  as citizens  of  Herakleia  (cf.  Diod. 14.82.6;  Polyaen. 2.21),  as would  the  fact  that  a  new  distribution  of  land  followed  the foundation  (Diod. 12.59.5).  Cf.  also  Paus. 10.22.1  (r 280),  who distinguishes  the  ruins  of  old  Trachis  from  the  city  of Herakleia;  and  St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  208  with  fig. 27  at 206,who locates  old  Trachis  in  the  lower  city  of  Herakleia.  See  also B\u00e9quignon  ( 1937b)  244,  who  locates  old  Trachis  on  the  later acropolis  of  Herakleia;  both  locations  imply  that  Trachis was  merged  with  Herakleia  at  the  latter's  foundation.  (Ps.- Skylax 62  lists alongside  `.  However,  this is  presumably  irrelevant  for  the  discussion  above,  since  it  is 710 decourt,  nielsen,  helly  et  al. likely  that  the  compiler  has  merged  sources  of  different dates.) From  the  outset  the  ethnic  identity  of  the  city  was  mixed (see  supra).  In  the  context  of  the  Amphiktyonic  League, Herakleia  counted  as  Malian,  at  least  in  C 4s  when  its  citizens are  seen  serving  the  Amphiktyony  as  Malian  hierom- nemones,  of  which  Herakleia  regularly  provided  one  (CID ii 36.i.9,  35,  ii.23  ( 340s),  43.27  ( 340),  76.i.27  ( 335),  77.i.2  ( 334/3), 97.65  ( 327/6),  102.i.17  ( 324/3),  102.ii.A33  ( 324/3),  32.49  (C 4l); cf. 74.i.58  ( 337/6)  for  one  serving  as  tamias),  the  other  being provided  by  Lamia.  However,  Diod. 18.11.1  (r 323)  describes  it as  Oitaian  (cf.  Diod. 15.57.2),  and  so  does  Strabo  ( 9.5.10). According  to  Thuc. 3.93.2,the  city  was  originally  populous (  );  Diod. 12.59.5  (cf.  Ps.-Skymnos  597)  gives the  number  of  settlers  as  10,000  ( 4,000  Lakedaimonians  and other  Peloponnesians,  and  6,000  from  the  rest  of  the Hellenes;  but  see  Schaefer  ( 1961)).  However,  the  city  was soon  depopulated  due  to  Spartan  maladministration  (Thuc. 3.93.2,  5.52.1):  the  Spartans  sent  out  to govern Herakleia,  which  was  clearly  treated  as  a  Spartan  dependen- cy  (Thuc. 3.93.2;  cf.  Xen.  Hell. 1.2.18,  where  such  a  Spartan officer is t ermed  \u00b5;  cf.  the  sketch  of  the  political  his- tory infra).  Ten  thousand  settlers  (Diod.;  Ps.-Skymnos)  is probably  not  a  historical  figure,  but  an  ideological  number (Schaefer  ( 1961);  for  another  view,  see  Helly  ( 1995)  280\u00ad87,a discussion  of  Thessalian  military  figures).  For  information on  the  level  of  population  there  are  only  hoplite  numbers  vel sim.:  in  426,  500  hoplites  served  with  Sparta  (Thuc. 3.100.2), and  in  409/8,  700  hoplites  fell  in  battle  against  the  Oitaians (Xen.  Hell. 1.2.18);  in  399,  500  citizens  were  executed  during  a stasis  (Diod. 14.38.4).  But  the  composition  of  the  population underwent  several  modifications as the city was drawn into the  power  struggles  of  the  larger  poleis. In 422/1  a  Spartan  army  on  the  march  for  Thrace  inter- fered  in  the  political  life  of  the  city  (Thuc. 5.12).In  420/19,the Herakleots  were  defeated  in  battle  by  the  Ainians, Dolopians,  Malians  and  some  Thessalians  (Thuc. 5.51.2; Diod. 12.77.4  reporting  heavy  losses);  these  people  had  been hostile  towards  the  foundation  from  the  beginning  (Thuc. 5.51.2).  In  419/18  the  Boiotians  (possibly  sent  for  by Herakleia  itself,  cf.  Diod. 12.77.4)  took  over  the  city  and expelled  the  Spartan  archon  Agesippidas  (Thuc. 5.52.1); however,  by  395  it  was  apparently  once  again  a  Spartan  ally (Xen.  Hell. 3.5.6).  In  409/8,  the  Herakleots  again  fought  the Oitaians,  losing  700  men  due  to  betrayal  by  their  Achaian allies  (Xen.  Hell. 1.2.18).  A  stasis  is  attested  for  399  (Diod. 14.38.4  and  infra);  citizens  exiled  by  the  Lakedaimonians  are reported for 395  (Diod. 14.82.6),  and  they  may  have  been exiled  on  this  occasion.  In  399,  the  Spartan  officer Herippidas  successfully  fought  off  the  Oitaian  threat  (Diod. 14.38.5).  In  395  the  city  was  captured  (with  inside help)  by  the  Boiotians  and  Argives,  who  killed  captured Lakedaimonians,  sent  off  other  Peloponnesians,  and restored  citizens  previously  exiled  by  the  Lakedaimonians (Diod. 14.82.6\u00ad7).  In  371/70,  Jason  of  Pherai  took  the  city  by treachery,  razed  the  walls  (Xen.  Hell. 6.4.27),  made  it  anas- tatos,  and  handed  over  the  territory  to  the  Oitaians  and  the Malians  (Diod. 15.57.2).  The  community  must,  however, have  been  reconstituted,  since  it  appears  in  C 4s:  cf.  the Delphic  inscriptions  cited  supra  and  Diod. 18.11.1,  56.5. The  city  was  initially  an  ally  of  Sparta  (Thuc. 3.100.2),and again  on  later  occasions  such  as  the  battle  of  Leuktra  (Xen. Hell. 6.4.9);  an  alliance  with  the  Phthiotic  Achaians  is implied  by  Xen.  Hell. 1.2.18.An  alliance  with  Boiotia  is  attest- ed  by  Xen.  Hell. 6.5.23. A stasis occurred  in  399  (Diod. 14.38.4):  the Lakedaimonians  sent  out  Herippidas  to  settle  the  problems; he  called  a  meeting  of  the  ekklesia  and  proceeded  to  execute 500  citizens  (Diod. 14.38.4);  Polyaen. 2.21  describes  the  citizens  here  executed  as  Trachinioi;  the  exiles  restored  by  the  Boiotians  and  Argives  in  395  are  likewise  described  as  Trachinioi  (Diod. 14.82.7),  and  this  suggests  that  the  city  experienced  severe  difficulties in integrating the Trachinians  and  the  new  settlers  (Gehrke,  Stasis 73;  Malkin ( 1994)  221\u00ad27).  Exiles  are  attested  in  395  (Diod. 14.82.6)  and again  in  319,  when  they  were explicitly  excluded  from  the general  amnesty  issued  by  Philip  Arrhidaios  (Diod. 18.56.5). A  citizen  of  Herakleia  is  listed  as  proxenos  of  Karthaia  on Keos  in  IG xii.5542.33  (C 4m). Herakleia  was  situated  at  a  distance  of 20  stades  from  the sea, 40  stades  from  Thermopylai  (Thuc. 3.92.6),and  6  stades from  the  site  of  Trachis  (Strabo  9.4.13).  To  the  west  the neighbours  were  Ainis  and  Oitaia,  to  the  north  Malis  and Lamia,  and  to  the  south  was  Doris,  and  to  the  south-east Thermopylai.  In  Strabo's  day  Parasopias  was  a  kome  in  the territory ( 8.6.24,  9.2.23);  in  the  Classical  period  it  was  possi- bly  a  polis  (see  the  entry  for  Parasopioi). Herakleia  was  fortified at its foundation ( Thuc. 3.92.6;  cf. Xen.  Hell. 6.4.27);  traces  of  fortifications (acropolis wall and city  wall)  are  briefly mentioned b y  St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  207. Docks  ( ) were constructed  at  the  foundation  as  well (Thuc. 3.92.6).  The  agora  is  mentioned  in  IG ix.2103.9 (C 2m).  Demetrios  of  Kallatis  (FGrHist 85)  fr. 6  (apud  Strabo 1.3.20)  reports  that  the  city  was  badly  damaged  by  an  earth- quake,  presumably  the  one  in  426  (Fossey  ( 1990)  183)  and thus  at  or  shortly  after  the  foundation. thessalia  and  adjacent  regions  711 The  chief  cult  was  presumably  that  of  Herakles  (Diod. 12.59.4);  other  attested  deities  are  Artemis  (Livy  36.22)  and Asklepios  (A.  Kontogiannis  ( 1997)  176).  A  festival  called Herakleia  is  attested  by  IG ix.1229.10  (C 2). IG iv  617.1  ( 316\u00ad293)  records  a  monetary  donation  by  the Herakleots  \"to  the sent  out  from  Argos  to announce  the  celebration  of  the  Nemean  Games  and  the Heraia\"  (Perlman  ( 2000)  74,  127\u00ad29).  Donations,  presum- ably  by  individual  Herakleots,  towards  the  rebuilding  of the  temple  at  Delphi  are  recorded  by  CID ii  12.i.54,  56 ( 341/40). Herakleia  struck  coins  in  silver  and  bronze  from  C 4e.

Lamia  was  a  Malian  community  (Ps.-Skylax  62;Diod. 18.11.1  (r 323);  cf.  infra  on  coins)  and  regularly  provided  the Amphiktyonic  League  with  one  of  the  Malian  hierom- nemones  (CID ii  32.49  ( 325),  36.i.10  ( 343\u00ad340),  36.i.36 ( 343\u00ad340),  etc.),  the  other  being  provided  by  Herakleia (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924b)  554).  (For  the  possibility  that  Lamia belonged  to  Achaia  prior  to  413,  see  Kip  ( 1910)  42\u00ad43  and St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924b)  553).  A  citizen  of  Lamia  served  the Amphiktyonic  League  as  tamias  (CID ii  74.i.57  ( 337/6)),  and another  fulfilled an unidentifiable  function  (CID ii  118.2\u00ad3 (c. 365\u00ad360)  with  comm.).

In  contradistinction  to  the  other  Malians,  the  Lamians did  not  join  the  Greek  alliance  during  the  Lamian  War (Diod. 18.11.1)  but  served  Antipatros  as  a  refuge  (Diod. 18.13). A  grant  of  politeia  and  proxenia  to  two  men  of  Larisa  is attested  by  IG ix.260  (C 4l).  The  same  decree  attests  to  the existence  of  a  board  of  archons,  a  strategos,a hipparchos  and a  grammateus  ( 13\u00ad18);  cf.  SEG 16  373  (C 3f)  attesting  to  the same  magistracies.  A  grant  of []     is included  in  IG ix.260.7\u00ad8  (C 4l)  as  well. According  to  Demetrios  of  Kallatis  (FGrHist 85)  fr. 6,as transmitted  by  Strabo  1.3.20,  the  city  of  Lamia  suffered  con- siderably  from  the  earthquake  of 426  (cf.  Fossey  ( 1990) 183\u00ad84),  but  no  details  are  given.  The  earliest  urban  remains at  the  site  are  on  the  acropolis,  which  rises  to  173  m;  there  are remains  of  a  C 6  polygonal  fortification wall and of  a  second phase  dating  to  C 5\u00adC4  (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924b)  548;  Scranton  ( 1941) 91\u00ad92;  Lauffer  ( 1989)  365\u00ad66).  During  the  Lamian  War, Antipatros  was  besieged  by  Leosthenes  in  Lamia  (Hyp. 6.12), but  its  city  walls,  whose  fine c onstruction  Diodorus  empha- sises  (   \u00b5),  were  able  to  withstand  the  assaults  (Diod. 18.13.1\u00ad3).  The  course of  these  walls  can  be  traced  or  reasonably  hypothesised  for its  entirety.  The  Classical  fortification ( c. 400)  consisted  of an  inner  and  an  outer  wall,  the  inner  running  for  c. 3  km  and the  outer  for  c. 4  km  (see  the  plan  in  St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924b)  549\u00ad50), and  enclosed  an  area  of 80  ha  (ibid. 552).Polyaen.4.4.2  refers to  houses  (oikiai)  in  Lamia  during  the  Lamian  War. Phalara  (  :Polyb.  20.10.16)  was,  according  to Steph.  Byz. 656.3,a  place   \u00b5;it is described by Livy  27.30.3  as  having  a  \"good  harbour\"(egregius  portus)  and so  was  probably  the  harbour  of  Lamia;  its  precise  location  is disputed  (cf.  St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  217;  B\u00e9quignon  ( 1937b)  295\u00ad97; PECS 697;  Lauffer  ( 1989)  533);  it  is  mentioned  as  existing  in 426  by Strabo 1.3.20. The  principal  divinity  was  presumably  Dionysos,  who  is depicted  on  coins  (infra)  and  whose  sanctuary  seems  to  have been  used  for  publishing  official documents ( IG ii\u00b2  861.28 (C 3l)).

If  the  legends  are  correctly  understood as  abbreviations  of  the  city-ethnics  of  Lamia  and  Trachis, then  this  coin  may  represent  a  joint  issue  of  these  two Malian  cities  (in  which  case  the  coin  should  predate  426, 712 decourt,  nielsen,  helly  et  al. which  fits Babelon's date of  C 5m;  cf.  Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 4  nos. 465\u00ad66  for  two  other  coins  possibly  to  be  ascribed  to  Lamia). However  that  may  be,  Lamia  is  known  to  have  struck  in  both silver  and  bronze  from  c. 400.

Trachis  (Trachinios) Map  55,  location  as  Herakleia (q.v.).  Size of  territory: 1  or 2.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is in  Hdt. 7.199,  and in  Ps.-Skylax  62  and Strabo  9.5.8.  The  city-ethnic  is  (Thuc. 3.92.2)  or (Hdt. 7.175.2).  Trachis  is  called  a  polis  in  the urban  sense  in  Hdt. 7.199,  a  passage  which  also  uses  the  verb about  the  city.  At  Thuc. 3.92.2  the  are  described  not  as  a  polis,  but  as  one  of  three  \u00b5  into which  the  Malians  were  subdivided;  however,  the  use  of meros  need  not  mean  that  Trachis  was  not  a  polis,  as  is  clear from  Hdt. 1.145,where merea  is  used  to  describe  twelve  com- munities  in  Peloponnesian  Achaia  which  were  all  poleis  in the  Classical  period.  Moreover,  Diod. 12.59.3  (r 426) describes  the  Trachinioi  as  the  politai  of  Trachis,  and  Diod. 14.82.7  and  Polyaen. 2.21  use  Trachinios  in  a  manner  which indicates  that  it  was  in  fact  the  city-ethnic  of  Trachis.  On  the assumption  that  Trachinios  is  a  city-ethnic,  the  following should  be  noted:  the  internal  collective  use  is  possibly  found abbreviated  as  on  C 5m  coins  which  may  be  a  joint  issue of  Trachis  and  Lamia  (infra).  The  external  collective use  of the  city-ethnic  is  found  in  Hdt. 7.175.2,  217.1;  Thuc. 3.92.2; and  Ctesias  (FGrHist 688)  fr. 13.128  (which  also  implies  some social  stratification:     ,   \u00b5).  The  external  individual  use  is  found  at Hdt. 7.213.3,  214.2.  Thuc. 3.92.2  attests  to  a  war  fought  by  the Trachinians  ( \u00b5   \u00b5),which implies the exis- tence  of  armed  forces,  as  may--for what it is w orth--Ctesias (FGrHist 688)  fr. 13.128  (       ,   \u00b5,     ).  The  sending  of  an  embassy to  Lakedaimon  is  attested  by  Thuc. 3.92.2.  The  territory  is referred to as at  Hdt. 7.199  and  as   at 7.201. In 426,  the  city  was  either  renamed  Herakleia  or  absorbed by  a  new  Sparta-sponsored  foundation  of  that  name  (see further  the  entry  for  Herakleia).  Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 4  no. 464  is  a  C 5m  silver  diobol  on  the  Aiginetan  standard:  obv. naked  and  bearded  Herakles  seated  on  rock  holding  kantharos  in  extended  right  hand  and  club  in  left;  legend: (?);  rev.  Hydria  in  incuse  square;  legend: (?).  If  the  legends  are  correctly  understood as  abbreviations  of  the  city-ethnics  of  Lamia  and  Trachis, then  this  coin  may  represent  a  joint  issue  of  these  two Malian  cities. 2.5  Achaia 433.Antron  Map 55.  Lat. 38.55,long.  22.55.  Size  of  territo- ry  ?  Type:  [A].  The  toponym  is  (Hom.  Il. 2.697), either (Strabo  9.5.8)  or  (Eust.  Il. 2.697),  or   ([Dem.] 10.9;  Ps.-Skylax 63;Strabo 9.5.7).  A  city-ethnic  is not  attested  except  in  late  sources,  such  as  the  entry  in  Steph. Byz. 101.16. In  Ps.-Skylax 63,  where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense, Antron  is  the  first of  five t oponyms  listed  between  the  head- ing     and  the  addendum         ;  polis  in  the  political  sense  is  not attested,  but  is  possibly  implied  by  Diod. 20.110.3  (r 302).  A citizen  of  Antron  served  as  Delphic  theorodokos  in 230\u00ad220 (BCH 45:  v.C(b).3). The  history  of  Antron  is  almost  completely  unknown; [Dem.] 10.9  states  that  Philip  II  \"bought\"( ) the city, and  Diod. 20.110.3  (r 302)  that  it  joined  Demetrios  after  his capture  of  Larisa  Kremaste. Antron  was  situated  in  Achaia  (Ps.-Skylax  63;Strabo 9.5.8).  At  the  site  of  the  city  are  traces  of  both  an  extremely badly  preserved  acropolis  wall  (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  182)  and  a polygonal  circuit  wall  (ibid.).  At  modern  Phano  a  cemetery of  Classical  and  later  times  has  been  identified ( ArchDelt 41 ([ 1986]  1990)  Chron. 74;  42  ([ 1988]  1993)  B. 1:  223  and  later issues). thessalia  and  adjacent  regions  713 434.  *Ekkarra  (Ekkarreus) Map  55.  Lat. 39.05,long.  22.10. Size of  territory: 2?  Type:  B.  The  toponym  is  in Steph.  Byz. 58.9,who     suggests  the  city-eth- nics and ;C 4s  coins,  however,  have '. No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Ekkarra  a  polis,but polis  status  is  suggested  by the  bronze  coinage  of  C 4s  (infra). IG ix.2  223  is  a  C 3l(?)  proxeny  decree  by  Ekkarra  which  uses polis  and  attests  to  the  existence  of  archons. Ekkarra  was  situated  in  Achaia  (Steph.  Byz. 58.9;Livy 32.13.13),  and  has  been  located  at  Kaitsa  (Helly  ( 1992)  85\u00ad89, pace  St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  154).  The  site  at  modern  Ano  Ktimeni (formerly  Ano  Dranista)  was  probably  a  second-order  set- tlement  in  its  territory.  At  the  site  of  Ekkarra  itself  is  a  C 4  cir- cuit  wall  running  for  775  m  and  with  quadrangular  towers; the  acropolis  was  separately  walled  (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  159; B\u00e9quignon  ( 1928)  463\u00ad65). Ekkarra struck  bronze  coins  in  C 4s:  obv.  head  of  Zeus,  or Apollo;  rev.  Artemis  standing;  legend:  (Head,  HN \u00b2294;Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 4  no. 475;  Rogers  ( 1932) nos. 207\u00ad9;  SNG  Cop.  Thessaly 47\u00ad48,  Suppl. 244). 435.  Halos  (Haleus) Map  55.Lat.39.10,long.22.50,but  see infra.  Size  of  territory: 2.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is   (Hom.  Il. 2.682;  Hdt. 7.173.1), ,  (Dem. 19.163);  cf. Strabo  9.5.8: ,      \u00b5. The  city-ethnic  is  (Dem. 19.36,  39;  coins,  infra); Steph.  Byz. 78.6  cites  Sophokles  (fr. 998,  Pearson)  for  the form  and  glossographoi  for . Halos  is  called  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Dem. 19.39,  and the  political  sense  is  presumably  implied  at  Dem. 19.36.The internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on  C 4\u00adC3 coins  (infra),  and  the  external  collective  use  is  found  in Dem. 19.36,  39. Halos  was  situated  in  Achaia  (Hdt. 7.173,197;  cf.  C 3  bronze coins  with  in  monogram:  Head,  HN \u00b2295).  Its  location, certainly  close  to  the  sea  (Hdt. 7.173.1;Dem.  19.163),  remains unknown;  Reinders  ( 1988)  159\u00ad63  proposes  to  locate  it  at Magoula  Plataniotiki.  In  its  territory  were  some  minor  set- tlements,  presumably  villages  (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  176\u00ad77; Reinders  ( 1988)  155\u00ad57,  161,  172),  and  a  temple  with Geometric  pottery  (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  177).  Several  military installations  are  attested  as  well  (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  177,  185; Reinders  ( 1988)  171;  Haagsma  et al.( 1993);  ArchDelt 49 ( 1994)  Chron. 325\u00ad26;  Malakassioti  et al.( 1994)),  some  of them  with  C 4  phases. The  urban  centre  itself,  then,  remains  unlocated  (Barr. follows  e.g.  PECS  in  putting  it  at  modern  Halmyros,  which  is unlikely).  At  7.197.2,  Herodotos  mentions  a  prytaneion (called in  the  local  dialect),  but  it  is  unclear  whether it  is  thought  of  as  belonging  to  the  local  community  of  Halos (so  Miller  ( 1978)  no. 324  and  Hansen  and  Fischer-Hansen ( 1994)  32)  or  to  the  Achaians  as  such.  From  the  mention  of  a siege  by  Parmenion  at  Dem. 19.163  (  \u00b5) it  may  be  inferred  that  Halos  was  fortified b y  C 4m;  upon  its capture,  it  became  depopulated  ( ... , Dem. 19.39)  and  the  territory  was  handed  over  to  the Pharsalians  (Dem. 11.1)  with  whom  Halos  had  had  a  conflict prior  to  its  capture  (Dem. 19.36).  It  was  refounded  in  the early  Hellenistic  period  (c. 302)  on  the  initiative  of  Demetrios Poliorketes.  See  Reinders  ( 1988). A  sanctuary  of  Zeus  Laphystios  is  mentioned  by  Hdt. 7.197.1,  where  a  legend  associated  with  it  is  recounted.  The patron  divinity  was  presumably  Artemis  Panachaia  (IG ix.2 add. 205.i.A.22,B.49  (Hell.)). Halos  minted  in  bronze  in  C 4\u00adC3.  Types:  obv.Zeus Laphystios;  rev.  Phrixos  or  Helle  with  ram;  legend: (Head,  HN \u00b2296;Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 4  nos. 467\u00ad69; Rogers ( 1932)  nos. 238\u00ad40;  Reinders  ( 1988)  236\u00ad51;  SNG  Cop.

The  toponym  is ,  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iii.138  ( 230\u00ad220)),  or   (Ptol.  Geog. 3.12.42).  The  city-ethnic  is  (CID ii 2.i.21  (C 4m)). Kypaira  was  situated  at  Kydonia  according  to  Helly  ( 1992) 79\u00ad80  (followed  by  Barr.),  who  rejects  Kaitsa  (championed by  St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  159\u00ad60  and  B\u00e9quignon  ( 1937b)  336).  At Kydonia  are  undated  remains  of  an  upper  circuit  measuring 120  40  m  with  a  width  of 2\u00ad2.5  m,  constructed  in  rectan- gular  blocks  in  regular  courses;  three  towers  are  preserved; to  the  south  is  a  poorly  preserved  lower  circuit  (B\u00e9quignon ( 1937b)  326\u00ad29,fig.  17).  According  to  Ptol.  Geog. 3.12.42, Kypaira  was  situated  in  Thessaliotis,  but  its  geographical position  puts  it  in  Achaia  (cf.  Kip  ( 1910)  73).  Kypaira  is  listed as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  CID ii  4.3\u00ad4,  12  (C 4m);  cf. 1.i.11,21  (C 4m).These  same  sources  attest  to  the  external  col- lective  use  of  the  city-ethnic.  Apart  from  these  inscriptions, the  information  on  Kypaira  postdates  our  period,  but  worth noting  is  BCH 45  ( 1921)  iii.138  ( 230\u00ad220)  listing  as theorodokos  of  Delphi. 437.  Larisa  (Larisaios) Map  55.  Lat. 38.55,long.  22.50.  Size of  territory:  ?  Type:  [A].  The  toponym  is  (Ps.- Skylax 63),  specified as  \u00b5  by Heracl.

The  city-ethnic  is  (CID ii  78.i.54  ( 337/6)),  speci- fied as [ ]    [  ] in IG  xii.5542.32 (C 4). In  Ps.-Skylax 63,  where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense, Larisa  is  the  second  of  five t oponyms  listed  between  the heading     and  the  addendum         ;  the  urban  sense  of  polis  is found  in  Diod. 20.110.2  (r 302)  as  well.  The  political  sense  is indirectly  attested  in  the  Delphic  accounts  of 337/6  (CID ii 74),where  a  tamias  of  Larisa  is  recorded  ( i.54)  after  the  head- ing  \u00b5   \u00b5   ( i.4).  For  an explicit  attestation,  see  an  undated  inscription  from  the  city itself  (IG ix.294.5).  The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city- ethnic  is  found  on  C 4l/C3e  coins  (Rogers  ( 1932)  no. 312),  the external  use  in  Demetrios  of  Kallatis  (FGrHist 85)  fr. 6  apud Strabo  1.3.20  (r 426)  (cf.  Fossey  ( 1990)  183\u00ad84)  and  Diod. 20.110.2  (r 302).  The  external  individual  use  is  found  in,  e.g., CID ii  118.6\u00ad7  ( 365\u00ad360),78.i.38  ( 337/6);  IG xii.5542.32  (C 4). A  citizen  of  Larisa  is  listed  in  a  C 4  catalogue  of  proxenoi  from Karthaia  on  Keos  (IG xii.5542.32). Larisa  was  situated  in  Achaia  (Heracl.  Cret. 3.2;  IG xii.5 542.32  (C 4);  Syll. \u00b3492.36  ( 232))  and  was  thus  an  Achaian community  (CID ii  78.i.38  ( 337/6));  the  city  regularly  pro- vided  the  Amphiktyonic  League  with  one  of  the  Achaian hieromnemones  (CID ii  32.47,  74.i.38,  76.i.23,  86.16,  118.6), the  other  being  provided  by  Melitaia. According  to  Strabo  9.5.13,  Larisa  was  situated  20  stades from  the  coast;  Diod. 20.110.2  (r 302)  mentions  a  harbour (limen)  at  Larisa.  The  Archaic/Classical  urban  history  of Larisa  is  almost  unknown,  all  remains  being  Hellenistic (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  182\u00ad84),  but  a  city  was  presumably  in  exis- tence  in  C 5l  since,  according  to  Demetrios  of  Kallatis (FGrHist 85)  fr. 6  (apud  Strabo  1.3.20),  Larisa  suffered  seri- ously  from  an  earthquake,  certainly  the  one  in  426  (Fossey ( 1990)  183\u00ad84). Larisa  struck  bronze  coins  in  C 4l/C3e;  types  vary,  the most  interesting  being  obv.  head  of,  presumably,  Achilles; rev.  Thetis  riding  on  a  sea-horse  and  carrying  the  shield  of Achilles;  legend: ,  and in monogram  (Rogers  ( 1932)  no. 312;  SNG  Cop.  Thessaly 151\u00ad52).

In  Ps.-Skylax 63,  where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense, Melitaia  is  the  third  of  five t oponyms  listed  between  the heading     and  the  addendum         .  The  political  sense  is  indirectly attested  in  the  Delphic  accounts  of 337/6  (CID ii  74),where  a tamias  of  Melitaia  is  recorded  ( i.53)  after  the  heading   \u00b5   \u00b5    ( i.4).  An  explicit  attesta- tion  of  the  political  sense  is  found  in  IG ix.2  208.3  (C 3e).The internal  and  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on C 4m  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2301).  The  external  and  individual use  is  found  in  CID ii  32.47  (C 4l),  74.i.38  ( 337/6).  The  exter- nal  and  collective  use  is  found  in  Ephor.  fr. 95.4. According  to  Ephor.  fr. 95,the  Melitaians  had  at  one  point entertained  friendly  relations  with  the  tyrants  of  Pherai,  but apart  from  that  the  political  history  of  the  city  is  unknown; a  citizen  of  Melitaia  was  granted  proxeny  by  Delphi  in  271 (F.Delphes iii.2  187).An  inscription  of  c. 140  (Ager  ( 1996)  no. 156)  refers  retrospectively  to  a  possibly  C 4  arbitration between  Melitaia  and  Narthakion  (Ager  ( 1989)  108). Melitaia  was  situated  in  Achaia  (Thuc. 4.78.1;  Ps.-Skylax 63;  CID ii  118.5\u00ad6  (C 4m)).  The  city  regularly  provided  the Amphiktyonic  League  with  one  of  the  Achaian  hierom- nemones  (e.g.  CID ii  32.47  (C 4l),  79A.ii.14  ( 334/3)),  the  other being  provided  by  Larisa.  The  territory  is  referred  to  as      at  Polyb. 18.6.4;  c. 270\u00ad260  its  bor- ders  were regulated  by international  arbitration  (Ager ( 1996)  no. 30).  At  the  site  of  the  city,  traces  of  a  circuit  wall, running  for  c. 4  km,  are  visible,  constructed  in  irregular  rec- tangular  blocks  (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  162).  At  modern  Haloni  a C 4  sanctuary  of  Asklepios  has  been  found  (BCH 96  ( 1972) 711). In C 4m  Melitaia  struck  coins  in  both  silver  and  bronze. ( 1)  Silver.

Peuma  (Peumatios) Map  55.  Lat. 39.10,long.  22.30. Size of  territory: 1.  Type:  C.  The  toponym  is  \u00b5,   (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iv.39  ( 230\u00ad220)).  The  city-ethnic  is \u00b5  (C 3e  coins,  infra;  Arvanitopoulos  ( 1909)  451 (c. 300);  I.Thessalie 131  (C 2e)). thessalia  and  adjacent  regions  715 Peuma  is  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  a  C 2e  hon- orific decree ( I.Thessalie 131)  and  implicitly  in  F.Delphes iii.4 351  (C 3m).  In  I.Thessalie 131 is  found  as  well  as  the internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic.  The  external  collec- tive  use  is  found  in  F.Delphes iii.4351,  and  the  external  and individual  use  is  attested  in,  e.g.,  Arvanitopoulos  ( 1909)  451 (Demetrias,  c. 300).  On  a  retrospective  interpretation  of these  sources  it  can  be  presumed  that  Peuma  was  a  polis  in C 4s. Peuma  was  situated  in  Achaia.  F.Delphes iii.4351  (C 3m) records  a  boundary  and  territorial  conflict between P euma and  at  least  two  of  its  neighbours,  Meliteia  and  Chalai,  a  con- flict which the city lost b y  arbitration  (cf.  Cantarelli  ( 1995)). In 230\u00ad220,  two  Delphic  therorodokoi  resided  in  Peuma (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iv.39,  v.25). The  well-preserved  remains  of  Peuma  at  Kallithea/Kislar date  to the  very end  of  C 4  or,  better,  to  the  beginning  of  C 3. The  fortification c omprises  a  circuit  wall  c. 2,400  m  long, with  many  towers  and  several  gates,  a  diateichisma  and  a small  acropolis  with  towers,  perhaps  of  an  earlier  date. Remains  of  civic  buildings  (agora  and  cisterns)  and  houses as  well  as  streets  are  still  visible  on  the  top  of  the  flat hill. Peuma  struck  bronze  coins  c. 302\u00ad286.  Types:  obv.  head  of nymph;  rev.  helmet  and  Achaean  monogram;  legend: (Head,  HN \u00b2304;  Rogers  ( 1932)  nos. 442\u00ad43;  SNG  Cop.  Thessaly 198). 440.  Phylake Possibly  a  polis  (type  B)  more  or  less  at  the site  of  the  later  Thebai  (no. 444),  with  which  it  was  merged by  synoecism  in  C 4s;  see  further  the  entry  for  Thebai. 441.Proerna  (Proernios) Map  55.  Lat. 39.15,long.  22.15. Size of  territory: 2.  Type:  [A].  The  toponym  is  , (Daffa-Nikonanou  ( 1973)  34\u00ad35  (C 2);  Strabo  9.5.10). The  city-ethnic  is  (CID ii  8.i.12  ( 338/7))  or (coins  (c. 300\u00ad200),  infra);  in  SEG 23  416.7 ( 450\u00ad425), is  presumably  a  variant  form  of  the city-ethnic. No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  explicitly  calls  Proerna  a polis,  but  it  merits  inclusion  here  on  account  of  ( 1)  SEG 23 416  ( 450\u00ad425),  a  grant  of  proxeny  by Pherai  to men described  as  (  external  individual  use  of  the city-ethnic),  and  thus  presumably  citizens  of  Proerna (supra);  ( 2)  in  the  Delphic  naopoioi's  accounts  the Proernians  are  presumably  recorded  in  a  fragmentary  list (CID ii  8.i.12:[ ]  (  external  collective use  of  the city-ethnic)),  the  heading  of  which  undoubtedly  included the  formula:  \u00b5    (CID ii  5.ii.25\u00ad26) vel  sim.;  ( 3)  furthermore,  coins  dated  c. 306\u00ad283  (Rogers ( 1932)  no. 534)  indicate  the  prior  existence  of  the  communi- ty  in  C 4s;  ( 4)  the  fact  that  a  man  of  Proerna  served  as Delphic  theorodokos  in  C 3  may  also  be  of  some  significance (see  the  note  on  Proerna  in  CID ii  p. 26). Proerna  probably  belonged  to Achaia  (Strabo  9.5.10;Kip ( 1910)  70\u00ad71).  At  the  site  are  remains  of  a  trapezoidal  circuit wall  in  grey  limestone  with  an  average  width  of  c. 2.5  m  and at  least  three  gates  or  posterns;  it  may  go  back  to  C 4  but  has seen  many  repairs.  The  acropolis  itself  was  walled  as  well (Daux  and  La  Coste  Messeli\u00e8re  ( 1924)  356\u00ad59;  St\u00e4hlin ( 1924a)  157\u00ad58).  Some  remains  of  the  lower  city  have  been excavated  to  the  south  of  the  Tapsi  hill  (Papakonstantinou ( 1994)  236\u00ad38).  Outside  the  city-wall  too  is  a  C 5\u00adC4  sanctu- ary  of  Demeter,  where  numerous  votives,  etc.,  have  been found  (Daffa-Nikonanou  ( 1973)). Proerna  struck  bronze  coins  c. 306\u00ad283.  Types:  obv.  head of  nymph  facing;  rev.  Demeter  with  torch  and  corn-ears; legend: (Head,  HN \u00b2  309;  Rogers  ( 1932)  no. 534;  SNG  Cop.  Thessaly 248). 442.  Pyrasos  (Pyrasios) Map  55.  Lat. 39.15,long.  22.50. Size of  territory: 2.  Type:  [A].  The  toponym  is  , (Hom.  Il. 2.695;Strabo 9.5.14);  the  city-ethnic  is   (Thuc. 2.22.3  with  Helly  ( 1995)  233  n. 88).  Strabo  9.5.14  gives \u00b5  as  the  contemporary  name  of  Pyrasos  and  a \u00b5  is  listed  by  Ps.-Skylax  63  among  the  cities  of Achaia. Pyrasos  is  listed  by  Thuc. 2.22.3  (for  which  see  Helly  ( 1995) 233  n. 88)  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense.  In  Ps.-Skylax  63, Demetrion  is  the  fourth  of  five t oponyms  listed  after  the heading     and  followed  by         ,but here the reference may be to the community  as  absorbed  by  the  synoecism  of  Thebai Phthiotides  (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  174;  RE  xxiv. 12).  The  external collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  in  Thuc. 2.22.3. Given  its  geographical  location  in  Achaia,  compared  with Thucydides'  description  of  it  as  Thessalian  ( 2.22.3),  a  good parallel  to  the  status  of  Pyrasos  (i.e.  a  polis  of  Thessalian Pelasgiotis  geographically  situated  in  Achaia)  would  be Pagasai  (cf.  Helly  ( 1995)  233  n. 88  with  refs.).  Ps.-Skylax describes  it  as  belonging  to  the  Achaians  (cf.  Steph.  Byz. 541.2),  and  it  seems  that  the  city  was  synoecised  into  Thebai Phthiotides  (no. 444)  some  time  in  C 4  (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  174; RE  xxiv. 12).  See  further  the  entry  for  Thebai  Phthiotides. According  to  Strabo  9.5.14,  Pyrasos  had  been  ( ) a polis with  a  good  harbour  and  a  sanctuary  of  Demeter. 443.  Thaumakoi  (Thaumakos) Map  55.  Lat. 39.10,long. 22.20.  Size  of  territory: 2  or 3.  Type:  B(?).  The  toponym  is 716 decourt,  nielsen,  helly  et  al. \u00b5  (Strabo  9.5.10),  or,  by  confusion  with  the Homeric \u00b5  in  Magnesia  (Hom.  Il. 2.716), \u00b5  (AG 7544.2;  Steph.  Byz. 307.5).  The  city-ethnic  is \u00b5  (IG ix.2216.1  (C 3e)).  Possibly  the  external  indi- vidual  use  is  attested  already  in  ArchDelt 26  ( 1971)  B. 1237.4: vac.  (C 4). The  earliest  attestation  of  a   \u00b5  is  in  IG ix.2216.1,  12  (C 3e),  an  inscription  that  records  two  grants  of proxeny  and  other  privileges,  and  refers  to a  board  of archons.  However,  an  inscription  of  C 4  (ArchDelt 26:B.1 237)  is  possibly  a  grant  of  proxeny,  etc.  to a  citizen  of Thaumakoi;  so  Thaumakos  may  be  included  in  this Inventory  as  a  possible  polis.  An  unattributed  epigram  of  the Anthologia  Graeca  ( 7544.2)  refers  to  Thaumakoi  as  a   . Thaumakoi  was  situated  on  the  main  road  between  the Spercheios  valley  to  the  south  and  the  Koile  to  the  north,  in Achaia  (Strabo  8.8.5;  AG 7544;  Steph.  Byz. 307.5;  Eust.  Il. 513.).  According  to  Strabo  8.8.5  (quoting  Artemidoros), Thaumakoi  was  500  stades  from  Kirrha  via  Herakleia,  and 340  from  Larisa. The  acropolis  is  situated  under  the  mediaeval  kastro  (ris- ing  to  639  m),  immediately  west  of  the  road  (Daux  and  de  La Coste  Messeli\u00e8re  ( 1924)  354;  RE \u00b2  v. 2.  1332);  it  has  a  rough  rec- tangular  shape  measuring  c. 100 70  m.  The  upper  town was  enclosed  by  a  circuit  running  for  c. 800\u00ad900  m;  it  is  con- structed  in  polygonal  or  rectangular  isodomic  masonry,  but is  not  very well  preserved;  there  is  evidence  for  two  semicir- cular  towers;  short  stretches  of  the  circuit  wall  date  to  C 4, but  the  remains  are  mainly  later  (PECS 324; Papakonstantinou  ( 1994)  235).  A  lower  city  probably  exist- ed,  but  nothing  is  known  about  it. 444.  Thebai  (Thebaios) Map  55.  Lat. 39.15,long.  22.45. Size of  territory: 4  (RE \u00b2  v. 2.  1584).  Type:  [A].  The  toponym  is ,  (Ps.-Skylax  63;Diod.  20.110.3  (r 302)),  distin- guished  from  that  of  homonyms  by  the  addition  of  (Heracl.  Cret. 3.2  (GGM i)),  or  ( )  (Diod. 26.9;Strabo 9.5.6)  or  (Ptol.Geog.3.12.14); according  to  Steph.  Byz. 666.6,  it  was  also  called   (      ).  The city-ethnic  is  (Diod. 18.11.1  (r 323));  in  SEG 12  375.5 ( 242)  it  was  specified in some way now lost;  in  IG vii  288 (C 3m)  it  is  distinguished  from  that  of  homonyms  by  the addition  of      . In  Ps.-Skylax 63,  Thebai  is  the  last  of  five t oponyms  listed between  the  heading      and  the  adden- dum          .  Thebai  refers  to itself  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  SEG 12  372  ( 242).  The collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  internally  on  coins of  C 4l  (infra)  and  externally  in  Diod. 18.11.1  (r 323).  The external  individual  use  is  found  in  IG vii  288  (C 3m). Thebai  belonged  to Achaia  (Ps.-Skylax  63;Diod.  18.11.1 (r 323)).To  the  north  the  neighbour  was  Pherai,  to  the  north- east  it  was  Amphanai,  to  the  east  (until  C 4s)  Pyrasos,  to  the south  Halos,  to  the  south-west  Peuma,  and  to  the  west Eretria  and  Pharsalos.  On  the  territory,  see  di  Salvatore (( 1994):  minor  settlements  and  fortresses).  On  the  frontier with  Halos  was  a  sanctuary  of  Athena  shared  by  the  two adjoining  cities  (BCH 59  ( 1935)  208\u00ad9). In  contradistinction  to  the  rest  of  the  Achaians,  the Thebans  did  not  join  the  Greek  alliance  opposing Makedonia  in  the  Lamian  War  (Diod. 18.11.1).  A  board  of is  attested  by  a  C 4l  dedication  (IG ix.21322;  cf. Prakt  ( 1907)  165). Recent  rescue  excavations  have  revealed  a  city  with cemetery,  antedating  C 4f  and  situated  on  the  western  slope of  the  hill  on  which  Thebai  itself  lay  (ArchDelt 47  ( 1992) 222\u00ad29);  Heracl.  Cret. 3.2  (GGM i)  claims  that was an  earlier  name  of  Thebai,  and  the  present  site  may  possi- bly  be  that  of  Phylake;  a  synoecism  of  Phylake  and  Pyrasos is  commonly  assumed  to  have  occurred  in  C 4s(RE\u00b2  v. 2. 1587\u00ad88)  and  is  presumably  to  be  regarded  as  the  founding of  Thebai  (in  which  case  the  pre-C 4s  evidence  from  the site,  notably  that  belonging  to  the  cult  of  Athena  Polias, strictly  speaking  belongs  to  Phylake,  which  must  then  be regarded  as  a  polis  (type  B)  in  its  own  right  prior  to  the synoecism);  a  Demetrion  is  listed  as  a  polis  in  the  urban sense  under  the  heading by  Ps.-Skylax 64,  and the  reference  may  be  to  Pyrasos  (renamed  as  Demetrion  at one  point;  cf.  Strabo 9.5.14)  as  absorbed  by  the  synoecism of  Thebai  (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  174;  RE  xxiv. 12)  and  functioning as  the  harbour  of  Thebai  (cf.  Hansen  ( 1997)  36\u00ad37).  Cf. Diod. 20.110.3  for  a  planned  C 4l  expansion  of  the  synoe- cism  attempted  by  Kassandros  but  prevented  by  Dionysios Poliorketes. A  cult  of  Athena  Polias  is  attested  by  a  C 4l  dedication  (IG ix. 21322;  cf.  Prakt  ( 1907)  165);  by  C 6  she  had  a  temple  on  the acropolis  (Prakt  ( 1907)  161,(1908)  163),  which  was  rebuilt  in C 5  and  again  in  C 4  (ArchDelt 49  ( 1994)  324).  The  acropolis itself  measures  1.9  ha  (RE \u00b2  v. 2.  1584)  and  shows  remains  of  a \"sehr  altert\u00fcmlischen  kyklopischen  Mauer\"  (RE \u00b2  v. 2.  1584). On  the  north  and  west  sides  an  isodomic  wall  was  added  in the  early  Hellenistic  period  (RE \u00b2  v. 2.  1584\u00ad85). The  C 4l/C3e  (RE \u00b2  v. 2.  1589)  circuit  wall  runs  for  2,400  m and  encloses  an  area  of 40  ha  (RE \u00b2  v. 2.  1585).  It consisted  of thessalia  and  adjacent  regions  717 an  isodomic  stone  socle  supporting  a  mudbrick  wall;  some forty  towers  are  discernible.  For  a  recent  plan,  see  ArchDelt 47  ( 1992)  Chron. 224.  Outside  the  circuit  are  cemeteries (Adrimi-Sismani  ( 2000)).  A  C 4\u00adC3  stoa  with  wooden columns  is  reported  in  Prakt  ( 1907)  162.In  C 4m  a  theatre  was constructed  (ArchDelt 47  ( 1992)  Chron. 222\u00ad25). In  addition  to  Athena  Polias,  cults  included  those  of Athena  Illais  (Prakt  ( 1908)  171\u00ad72,  175  (C 4)),  Demeter Panachaia  (SEG 25  643  (Hell.);  coins,  infra),  Protesilaos (Pind.  Isthm. 1.58;  coins,  infra),  Nika  (Prakt  ( 1907)  171\u00ad72,175 (C 4))  and  Leukothea  (ibid.  (C 4\u00adC3)).

Size  of  territory:  ?  Type:  [A].  For  the  location,  see  Helly ( 1987)  152\u00ad53  and  Tziaphalias  ( 1994a).  The  toponym  is \u00b5,  (Hes.  fr. 59.3;  Steph.  Byz. 88.11);  according  to Steph.  Byz. 89.2\u00ad3,  the  C 4\u00adC3  writer  Suidas  used  the toponym \u00b5  (  FGrHist 602,fr.  4).  In Ps.-Skylax  65, is  presumably  a  corruption  of \u00b5.  The  city- ethnic  is  \u00b5  (IG ii\u00b2  5227  (C 4l/C3e?));  according  to Steph.  Byz. 88.15,  Eupolis  (  fr. 423  (PCG))  used  the  city- ethnic \u00b5  ( \u00b5?;  cf. 708.12);  Steph.  Byz. 88.16 suggests \u00b5  as  an  alternative. No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Amyros  a  polis,but as paraphrased  by  Steph.  Byz.  ( 89.2),  Suidas  (FGrHist 602)  fr. 4 may  have  classified A myrike  as  a  polis  (    \u00b5   ),  and  if  the  restoration  of \u00b5  in  Ps.- Skylax 65  is  accepted,  Amyros  is  there  one  of  the  cities  men- tioned  under  the  heading  .  That  Amyros  was  a polis  is  also  indicated  by  the  occurrence  of  the  external  col- lective  city-ethnic  (Eupolis  fr. 423  (PCG))  and  IG ii\u00b2  5227 (C 4\u00adC3e(?)),  a  sepulchral  inscription  set  up  by  the  city  of Kasthanaie  to  commemorate     \u00b5,who had  fallen  in  battle;  the  external  collective  use  of  the  city- ethnic  and  the  existence  of  Amyrian  troops  both  indicate that  it  may  have  been  a  polis  in  C 4l/C3e,  and  since  the  city certainly  existed  prior  to C 4l,  it  may  possibly  have  been  a polis.  However,  the  site  identified as A myros  was  abandoned c. 400,and  no  new  site  of  the  Amyreis  has  been  identified;  the community  may  possibly  have  been  installed  somewhere else,  perhaps  at  Kasthanaie.

On  the  basis  of  the  types  (which  recall  those  of Larisa,  as  St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  227  noted)  the  Eureaioi  may  possi- bly  be  assigned  to  Pelasgiotis;  but,  also  on  the  basis  of  the types,  Moustaka  ( 1983)  45  assigned  them  to  Magnesia  (cf. Westlake  ( 1935)  4  with  n. 2).The  Dionysiac  iconography  and the  style  of  the  coins  along  with  the  letter  do  in  fact  asso- ciate  these  coins  with  those  of  Eurymenai,  and  it  is  not impossible  that  they  indeed  belong  to  this  city.  However,  if they  belong  to  an  otherwise  unattested  community,  this community  may  be  classed  as  a  possible  polis  in  C 4m. 447.  Eurymenai  (Eurymenios) Map  55.

No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Eurymenai  a  polis,but in  Ps.-Skylax  65  Eurymenai  is  one  of  the  toponyms  listed after  the  heading   ,  where polis  is  used  in  the urban  sense.  That  it  was  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  too  is indicated  by  its  C 4f  bronze  coinage  (infra). Eurymenai  was  a  Magnesian  city  (Ps.-Skylax  65).  For  the location,  Ap.  Rhod. 1.594\u00ad95  is  decisive,  and  Eurymenai should  be  located  at  the  entrance  to  the  Tempe  valley  at  the site  traditionally  identified w ith  Homolion  (Barr.  lat. 39.50, long. 22.50).  The  acropolis  was  enclosed  by  a  wall  construct- ed  in  irregular  slabs  of  slate;  on  it  has  been  found  the remains  of  a  temple  with  which  were  associated  C 5\u00adC4 black-glazed  sherds  and  a  foot  of  a  colossal  statue  (St\u00e4hlin ( 1924a)  47).

Homolion  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Ps.-Skylax 33.  The  political  sense  is  indirectly  attested  in  the  Delphic accounts  of 362/1  (CID ii  1),  where  the  city  is  listed  ( i.18) under  the  heading  [ \u00b5    ]  ( i.11),and  those  of 337/6  (CID ii  74),  where  a  tamias  of  Homolion  is  recorded ( i.55)  after  the  heading   \u00b5   \u00b5  ( i.4).  The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is found  on  C 4  coins  (infra);  the  external  collective use  is found  in  CID ii  1.i.18  ( 362/1).  The  external  individual  use  is found  in  CID ii  32.48  (C 4l)  and  74.i.55  ( 337/6). Homolion  was  a  Magnesian  city  (Ps.-Skylax  33;  CID ii 74.i.55  ( 337/6));  for  the  location,  Ap.  Rhod. 1.594\u00ad95  is  clear, and  pace  St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  46\u00ad47  and  Giesinger  ( 1956),  it should  be  located  at  Palaiokastro  Karitsas,  though  the  only evidence  there  is  a  Byzantine  wall  (Helly  (forthcoming (b))),  and  not  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  Tempe  at  modern Homolio,  formerly  Laspochori  (PECS,  etc.,  followed  by Barr.).  Homolion  regularly  provided  the  Amphiktyonic League  with  one  of  the  Magnesian  hieromnemones  (e.g.  CID ii  32.48  (C 4l),  74.40  ( 337/6);  see  Lef\u00e8vre  ( 1998)  89),  the  other being  provided  by  Korakai,  Methone  or  Olizon;  an Amphiktyonic  tamias  provided  by  Homolion  is  listed  in CID ii  74.55  ( 337/6).  A  donation  of 300  dr.  toward  the rebuilding  of  the  temple  at  Delphi  is  attested  by  CID ii  1.i.18 ( 362/1),  and  IG iv  617.13  ( 316\u00ad293)  records  a  monetary  dona- tion  by  Homoloion  \"to  the  sent  out  from  Argos  to announce  the  celebration  of  the  Nemean  Games  and  the Heraia\"  (Perlman  ( 2000)  74,  127\u00ad29).

Ap. 218),  or '(Hdt.5.94.1;Ps.-Skylax  65),  (Pind.  Pyth. 4.77)  and (schol.  Pind.  Nem. 3.57).  The  city-ethnic  is  '  on C 4f  coins  (infra)  and  '  in  a  decree  of 276\u00ad236 (Meyer  ( 1936)). Iolkos  is  primarily  connected  with  Thessalian  mythology (Bakhuizen  ( 1996)  89\u00ad90),  and  evidence  for  the  historical community  is  exiguous  (ibid. 103).  By  C 6l  at  the  latest,  it must  have  been  a  dependency  of  the  Thessalians:  it  is  report- ed  by  Hdt. 5.94.1  that  the  Thessalians  offered  Iolkos  to  the Athenian  tyrant  Hippias  upon  his  expulsion  from  Athens  in 511/10.The  evidence  for  its  polis  status  is  C 4s:  in  Ps.-Skylax  65 Iolkos  is  the  first t oponym  listed  after  the  heading   ,  where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense,  and  the  city struck  coins  inscribed  (A.  Furtw\u00e4ngler  and  K.  Liampi,  pers.  comm.;  no  further  details). In C 4s,  Iolkos  was  a  Magnesian  city  (Ps.-Skylax  65),  and  it is  commonly  located  at  Kastro  Volou  (so  Barr.;  cf. Indzesiloglou  ( 1994)).  Here  is  a  settlement  with  which  are associated  inter  al.C 6  and  C 5  graves  (Lauffer  ( 1989)  709) and  remains  of  a  temple  (RE  ix. 1853).  The  principal  divinity was  Artemis  (Meyer  ( 1936)  371). 450.  Kasthanaie  (Kassanaeus) Map  55.  Lat. 39.35,long. 22.55.  Size  of  territory: 2.  Type:  A.

The  (external?)  collective  use  of the  city-ethnic  is  found  in  IG ii\u00b2  5227.1  (C 4l/C3e),  a  sepul- chral  inscription  set  up  by  the  city  of  Kasthanaie  to  com- memorate     \u00b5,  who  had  fallen  in  battle. Kasthanaie  was  a  Magnesian  city  (Hdt. 7.183.3),  situated right  on  the  coast.

Delphic  inscriptions mention  a  Magnesian  ethnic  as  (CID  II 5.III.36 ( 362\u00ad360))  or  (CID ii  32.48  (C 4l)),  and  it  seems reasonable  to  regard  the  K(o)rokaioi  as  the  inhabitants  of Korakai  (cf.  St\u00e4hlin  ( 1921)  1371).  Korakai  is  listed  as  a  polis  in thessalia  and  adjacent  regions  719 the  urban  sense  in  Ps.-Skylax  65  under  the  heading   ;in  CID ii  5.ii.25,  36  ( 362\u00ad360)  the  community  is  listed as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  under  the  heading   \u00b5    .  The  external  collective  use  of  the  city- ethnic  is  found  in  CID ii  5.ii.36  ( 362\u00ad360),  and  the  external individual  use  in  CID ii  74.ii.30  ( 337/6). Korakai  is  possibly  to  be  located  at  Nevestiki  near Lechonia,  a  hill  with  a  pre-C 4  fortification and black-glazed pottery  (Wace  ( 1906)  153\u00ad54);  this  site  was  presumably Thessalian  until  C 4m;  a  parallel  is  provided  by  Iolkos  and Pyrasos  and  by  Pagasai  and  its  sanctuary  of  Apollo  Aktios (or  Pagasites),  situated  on  the  southern  shore  of  the  bay  of Volos  opposite  Korope.  Pagasai  is  described  as  Thessalian  by Ps.-Skylax 64  (see  further  the  entry  for  Pagasai).  This  part  of the  Gulf  of  Pagasai,  then,  was  Thessalian  in  the  Classical period  until  the  arrival  of  the  Magnesians  in  this  part  of Thessaly,  when  it  was  detached  from  the  Thessalians  by Philip  II  (cf.  Pagasai  (no. 407)).The  identification is,  howev- er,  uncertain,  and  the  site  has  also  been  identified as that of Magnesian  Methone  (Masson  ( 1968)  97  n. 5;  Barr.). Korakai  was  a  Magnesian  community  (Ps.-Skylax  65), and  it  sometimes  provided  the  Amphiktyony  with  one  of the  Magnesian  hieromnemones  (CID ii  32.48  (C 4l),  74.i.39, ii.30  ( 337/6),76.i.25  ( 324/4),100.i.16  ( 325/4),102.i.15  ( 324/3)), the  other  being  provided  by Homolion  (and  by Methone  or Olizon  when  Korakai  did  not  provide  one).  An  Archaic inscription  (SEG 17  287  (c. 550))  from  the  possible  site  of Korakai  (see  supra)  records  building  activity,  presumably connected  with  a  public  construction,  and  describes  a  man as (see  further  Masson  ( 1968)  and  idem  in RPhil 54  ( 1980)  226\u00ad27). 453.

Meliboia  is  called  a  polis  in  the  territorial  sense  by  Hdt. 7.188.3,  and  in  Ps.-Skylax  65  it  is  one  of  the  toponyms  listed after  the  heading   ,  where polis  is  used  in  the urban  sense.  It  is  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  at  Plut. Pel. 29.4  (r 367\u00ad366).  The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city- ethnic  is  attested  by  C 4f  coins  and  on  undated  tiles  stamped \u00b5[]     (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  50);  the  external individual  use  is  attested  by  IG ii\u00b2  9331  (C 4m);  I.Iasos 54.5 (C 4l),  and  the  external  collective use  by Tod  196.13 ( 330\u00ad326).  During  the  crisis  of 330\u00ad326  Meliboia  received 28,500  medimnoi  of  grain  from  Kyrene  (Tod  196.13,  37). Meliboia  was  a  polis  enspondos  of  Alexander  of  Pherai,  who nevertheless  massacred  those  attending  an  ekklesia  in 367\u00ad366  (Plut.  Pel. 29.4).  A  citizen  of  Meliboia  was  granted proxeny  by Iasos  in  C 4l  (I.Iasos 54). Meliboia  was  a  Magnesian  city  (Ps.-Skylax  65)  and  was probably  situated  at  Kastro  Velika  near  Velika,  north  of  the Agiokambos  plain  (Tziaphalias  ( 1994a)),  a  site  which remains  to be  archaeologically  investigated.  C 5  cults  are attested  for  Apollo,  Poseidon  and  Athena  (ArchEph  ( 1930)  19 nos. 2\u00ad4). In C 4f,  Meliboia  minted  in  both  silver  and  bronze.

Byz. 583.13  has but  cites  Hellan.  fr. 201  for a  form  which  Jacoby  prints  as  and  Meineke (loc.  cit.)  as  (cf.  Meineke's  app.  crit.  ad  loc.).  The city-ethnic  is  (IG ix.21111.1  (c. 130)). Spalauthra  is  listed  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  in  Ps.- Skylax 65  under  the  heading   .  The  city-ethnic  is attested  only  at  a  time  when  the  city  was  a  constituency  of Demetrias  (IG ix.2  1111  (c. 130)). Spalauthra  was  a  Magnesian  city  (Ps.-Skylax  65).  To  the south  the  neighbour  was  Olizon,  to  the  north-west  Korope and  Korakai.  Although  it  does  not  appear  in  Strabo's account  of  the  synoecism  of  Demetrias  ( 9.5.15  (r 293)),  it appears  as  a  constituent  community  of  Demetrias  in Hellenistic  and  later  inscriptions  (IG ix.2  1111  (c. 130);  SEG 23 405  (first t o  second  centuries  ad))  and  so  was  included  in  the synoecism  at  some  point.  On  top  of  the  hill  of  Chortokastro the  church of  Ag.  Nikolaos  presumably  stands  on  the  site  of an  ancient  temple  (Koder  and  Hild  ( 1976)  140);  if  so,  this  hill was  probably  the  acropolis  of  Spalauthra. 2.7  Perrhaibia 459.Azoros  (Azoriastas) Map  55.  Lat. 40.00,long.  22.05. Size of  territory: 2.  Type:  C  (classified as a fort/tower b y Barr.,  but  see  infra).  The  toponym  is  (Gonnoi 93.B.28  (C 3l))  or  ,  (Polyb. 28.13.1;  IG xii.8178.a.2 (C 2));  Rhianos  apud  Steph.  Byz. 32.19  uses ;Steph. Byz. 32.18  states  that  a  plural  form  was  also  found  (  ).  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG ix.1689.17 (C 2e)). No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Azoros  a  polis,but it may  possibly  have  been  one:  according  to  Livy  42.53.5,  it  was one  of  the  three  oppida  making  up  the  Perrhaibian  Tripolis (&lt;Perseus&gt; descendit ad A zorum,  Pythoum,  Dolichen: tripolim  vocant  incolentes  haec  tria  oppida),  an  association for  which  C 4f  bronze  coins  are  attested  (infra).  If  the  name Tripolis  means  that  the  constituent  communities  were thessalia  and  adjacent  regions  721 poleis,  then  Azoros  was  a  polis.  (See  also  the  entries  for Doliche  and  Pythoion.)  Furthermore,  the  name  of  the  city has  been  restored  at  Diod. 19.52.6,  and  this  passage  uses  polis in  the  urban  sense  retrospectively  in  reference  to  316;Strabo 7.7.9  uses  polis  about  it  retrospectively  too,  but  with  no  pre- cise  indication  of  date.  It  is  also  called  polis  in  a  C 3l  inscrip- tion  (Gonnoi 93.B.28).  The  city-ethnic  is  attested  only  in  the Hellenistic  period:  the  external  collective use  is  found  in  IG ix.1689.17  (C 2e),  and  the  external  individual  use  in  ArchEph ( 1923)  144,  379.C.16  (first c entury  ad). The  territory  of  Azoros  to  the  north  bordered  on  that  of Doliche  (a  fellow  member  of  the  Tripolis),  to  the  east  on  the territories  of  Askyris  and  Oloosson,  to  the  south  on  that  of Malloia,  and  to  the  west  on  that  of  Mondaia.  See  the  map  in Lucas  ( 1995)  130.  On  the  territory,  see  further  Lucas  ( 1997) 149\u00ad51. Azoros  was  situated  in  Perrhaibia  (Diod. 19.52.6;Polyb. 28.13.1;  IG ix.1689.5  (C 2))  or  Pelagonia  (Strabo  7.7.9); Ptol.  Geog. 3.12.39  places  it  in  Pelasgiotis.  With  Pythoion  and  Doliche,  Azoros  formed  the  Perrhaibian  Tripolis (Livy  42.53.5,  quoted  supra;  IG xii.8178.a.2  (C 2);  Strabo 7.7.9;  Steph.  Byz. 32.16,  637,  s.v. :      ).  Like  Doliche  and  Pythoion--fellow mem- bers  of  the  Tripolis--Azoros is absent from the list of Perrhaibian  polities  in  SEG 29  546  ( 375\u00ad350);  this  fact  (and the  fact  that  the  dispute  between  Doliche  and  Eleimiotis  was settled  by  the  Makedonian  king,  Amyntas,  see  s.v.  Doliche) suggests  that  in  C 4e  the  Tripolis  was  under  Makedonian  rule (Lucas  ( 1997)  80\u00ad81,  211\u00ad16). The  acropolis  was  separately  walled  (Lucas  ( 1997) 162\u00ad65).  The  preserved  remains  of  the  circuit  wall  are  of  the later  Hellenistic  period  (ibid.),  but  Diod. 19.52.6  (r 316)  men- tions  a  siege  of  Azoros  and  thus  implies  the  existence  of  for- tifications.  There  are  numerous  traces  of  buildings  at Azoros,  but  in  the  absence  of  excavation  they  cannot  be identified (Lucas ( 1997)  166\u00ad68). A  few  divinities  are  known  from  dedications:  Apollo Lykeios  (C 4\u00adC3,  unpublished),  Apollo  Doreios  (C 3\u00adC2, unpublished),  Apollo  Pythios  (Peek  ( 1974)  7  (C 3\u00adC2)),  and Asklepios  (C 3f,  unpublished),  but  the  patron  divinity  has not  been  identified. The  Tripolis  of  Azoros,  Pythoion  and  Doliche  struck bronze  coins  in  C 4f.  Types:  obv.  Apollo;  legend: ;  rev.  tripod  (Liampi  ( 1990)). 460.  Chyretiai  (Chyretiaios) Map  55.  Lat. 39.50,long. 22.10.Size  of  territory: 2.Type:  C.  The  toponym  is  , (Ptol.  Geog. 3.12;  ArchEph  ( 1917)  1,  301.3  (C 2e)).  The  city- ethnic  is  (SEG 29  546.10\u00ad11  ( 375\u00ad350))  or (EAM 40.8  GV i40.8  (C 3l/C2e)). No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Chyretiai  a  polis,but two  men  from  the  city  are  listed  under  the  heading in  an  inscription  of 375\u00ad350  which  has  been interpreted  as  a  catalogue  of  Perrhaibian  polities  making  a joint  dedication  to  Apollo  Pythios  at  Oloosson  and  which includes  such  Perrhaibian  communities  as  Phalanna  and Gonnoi  (SEG 29  546  ( 375\u00ad350)).  It  is  called  polis  in  the  polit- ical  sense  in  Hellenistic  documents,  e.g.  ArchEph  ( 1917)  1, 301.8  (      ( 191)).The  external  indi- vidual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on  a  C 3  tombstone (EAM 40.8  GVI 40.8  (C 3l/C2e)). Chyretiai  was  situated  in  Perrhaibia  (SEG 29  546,by implication;  see  the  map  in  Lucas  ( 1995)  130),  though  Ptol. Geog. 3.12  places  it  in  Pelasgiotis.  (For  C 5  coins  of  the Perrhaibians,  see  the  entry  for  Oloosson.)  St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  25 briefly mentions an acropolis wall and t races  of  an  isodom- ic  city  wall. 461.  Doliche  (Dolichaios) Map  50.  Lat. 40.05,long.  22.10. Size of  territory: 2.  Type:  C.  The  toponym  is  , (Polyb. 28.13.1;  IG ix.21296  (C 1));  the  city-ethnic  is (EAM 6.2  (C 1)).  No  Archaic  or  Classical  source calls  Doliche  a  polis,  but  it  may  possibly  have  been  one: according  to  Livy  42.53.5,it  was  one  of  the  three  oppida  mak- ing  up  the  Perrhaibian  Tripolis  (&lt;Perseus&gt; descendit ad Azorum,  Pythoum,  Dolichen:  tripolim  vocant  incolentes  haec tria  oppida),  an  association  for  which  C 4f  bronze  coins  are attested  (infra).  If  the  name  Tripolis  means  that  the  con- stituent  communities  were  poleis,  then  Doliche  was  a  polis. (See  also  the  entries  for  Azoros  and  Pythoion). Furthermore,  C 4f  possession  of  a  territory  by  Doliche  is attested  by  a  document  dating  to  the  reign  of  Trajan:  the document  concerns  a  territorial  conflict between Doliche and  the  Elimiotes  and  refers  to  a  similar  conflict between the same  communities  during  the  reign  of  Amyntas  III ( 390\u00ad371),  the  father  of  Philip  II  (Wace  and  Thompson ( 1910\u00ad11)  195,ll.  16\u00ad18,  198;  Lucas  ( 1992)  132\u00ad34,(1997) 148\u00ad49).  The  external  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is found  in  C 1  (EAM 6.2).  The  external  collective use  of  the ethnic  may  have  been  used  on  the  stele  of  Amyntas'  arbitra- tion  which  was  set  up  in  the  forum  at  Doliche  (l. 13)  and  was pronounced  inter  Dolichanos  et  Eleimiotes  (ll. 18\u00ad19;Wace and  Thompson  ( 1910\u00ad11)). Doliche  was  situated  in  Perrhaibia  (Polyb. 28.13.1;  cf.  Ptol. Geog. 3.12.39,  who  places  it  in  Pelasgiotis).  Like  Azoros  and Pythoion  (with  whom  Doliche  formed  the  Perrhaibian 722 decourt,  nielsen,  helly  et  al. Tripolis),  it  is  absent  from  the  list  of  Perrhaibian  polities  in SEG 29  546  ( 375\u00ad350);  this  fact  (and  the  fact  that  the  dispute between  Doliche  and  Eleimiotis  was  settled  by  the Makedonian  king,  see  supra)  suggests  that  in  C 4e  the Tripolis  was  under  Makedonian  rule  (Lucas  ( 1997)  80\u00ad81, 211\u00ad16).  To the  south  its  territory bordered  on  that  of  Azoros (a  fellow  member  of  the  Tripolis),  to  the  west  on  that  of  the Elimiotes,  and  to  the  east  on  that  of  Pythion  (a  fellow  mem- ber  of  the  Tripolis).  See  the  map  in  Lucas  ( 1995)  130.  In  C 4f Doliche  had  a  territorial  conflict w ith  the  Elimiotes  (Wace and  Thompson  ( 1910\u00ad11);  Lucas  ( 1992)  132\u00ad34,(1997) 148\u00ad49). The  acropolis  was  separately  walled,  but  the  wall,  built  of quadrangular  blocks,  has  been  destroyed  by  modern  con- structions  (Lucas  ( 1997)  175\u00ad77).  Since  the  publication  of Lucas  ( 1997)  new  archaeological  investigation  has  ( 1) demonstrated  the  existence  of  a  C 4\u00adC3  city  wall,  and  ( 2) unearthed  several  remains  of  buildings  (possibly  the  agora); ArchDelt 51  ( 1996)  363\u00ad64. The  Tripolis  of  Azoros,  Pythoion  and  Doliche  struck bronze  coins  in  C 4f.  Types:  obv.  Apollo;  legend: ;  rev.  tripod  (Liampi  ( 1990)). 462.  *Ereikinion  (Ereikineus) Map  55.  Lat. 39.45,long. 22.00.  Size  of  territory: 2.  Type:  [A].  The  toponym  is  proba- bly  * reconstructed  from  Latin  Ericinium  (Livy 36.13.6)  and  the  city-ethnic  '  (SEG 29  546;  cf. 33 457  ( 375\u00ad350))  or  '  (CID ii  9.4  (C 4m)). No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  *Ereikinion  a  polis, but  in  the  Delphic  naopoioi's  accounts  the  '  are recorded  in  a  fragmentary  list  (CID ii  9.4),  the  heading  of which  undoubtedly  included  the  formula   \u00b5    (CID ii  5.ii.25\u00ad26)  vel  sim.  Furthermore, two  men  from  the  city  are  listed  under  the  heading '  in  an  inscription  of 375\u00ad350  which  has  been interpreted  as  a  catalogue  of  Perrhaibian  polities  making  a dedication  to  Apollo  Pythios  at  Oloosson  and  includes  such Perrhaibian  communities  as  Phalanna  and  Gonnoi  (SEG 29 546).  Furthermore,  CID ii  9.4  (C 4m)  records  a  donation  by the '.A C 2  inscription  attests  the  external  indi- vidual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  (Gonnoi 42). *Ereikinion  was  situated  near  the  village  of  Mega- Eleftherochori  (formerly  Kebir);  cf.  Lucas  ( 1995).  It  was  a Perrhaibian  city  (CID ii  9.4  (C 4m);  see  the  map  in  Lucas ( 1995)  130)  and  is  listed  in  SEG 29  546  ( 375\u00ad350).

The  toponym  is  ,  (Hdt. 7.128.1;  Eust.  Il. 2.739)  or  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iii.39 ( 230\u00ad220)).The  city-ethnic  is  (C 4  coins,  infra;  SEG 29  546.16  ( 375\u00ad350);  cf. 33  457);  Steph.  Byz. 211.3  gives and ,  both  unattested. Gonnos  is  called  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Hdt. 7.128.1, 173.4;  polis  in  the  political  sense  occurs  in  SEG 35  566  (c. 300) and  frequently  in  Hellenistic  decrees  of  the  city,  e.g.  Gonnoi 2.8  (C 3e),  which  also  has  [politai]  (l. 9).  Patris  is  found  in Gonnoi 211  (C 3).  The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city- ethnic  is  found  on  C 4  coins  (infra)  and  in,  e.g.,  Gonnoi 1.3 (C 4l/C3e).  The  external  collective use  is  attested  in  SEG 29 546.16  ( 375\u00ad350)  and  IG iv  617.13  ([ ]  (C 4l)).  At  Hdt. 5.63.3,  the  transmitted  is  sometimes  emended  to (e.g.  How  and  Wells  ( 1928)  ad  loc.),  but  see  Helly ( 1995)  103.  The  external  individual  use  is  found  in  IG ii\u00b2 1132.66  (c. 278). Gonnos  was  situated  in  Perrhaibia  (Hdt. 7.128.1,173.4;  IG ii\u00b2 1132.66  ( 130/29)),and  is  recorded  in  SEG 29  546  ( 375\u00ad350),a  list of  Perrhaibian  polities  making  a  joint  dedication  to  Apollo Pythios  at  Oloosson.  (For  C 5  coins  of  the  Perrhaibians,  see  the entry  for  Oloosson.) On  military  matters,  all  evidence  is  Hellenistic  (see  Helly ( 1973)  145\u00ad46);  evidence  on  the  political  organisation  is  like- wise  Hellenistic  (Helly  ( 1973)  138\u00ad45).  Gonnoi 1  (C 4l/C3e)  is a  grant  of  proxeny  to a  man  from  Larisa.  Gonnoi 5  (C 3)  com- bines  proxeny  with  enktesis,  epinomia,etc.  IG iv  617.13 ( 316\u00ad293)  records  a  monetary  donation  by  Gonnos  \"to  the sent  out  from  Argos  to announce  the  celebration  of the  Nemean  Games  and  the  Heraia\"  (Perlman  ( 2000)  74, 127\u00ad29). Situated  on  the  end  of  a  ridge  on  the  lower  slopes  of  Mt. Olympos,  the  city  of  Gonnos  was  centred  on  three  hills,  the northernmost  of  which  formed  the  acropolis  with  a  temple of  Athena  Polias  constructed  650\u00ad600  (Helly  ( 1973)  72  with map  i);  in  this  sanctuary  public  documents  were  published; it  was  restored  in  C 4l  (ibid. 95).  The  acropolis  was  separate- ly  walled,  possibly  from  the  Archaic  period  (PECS 359).  In the  Hellenistic  period  (PECS 360)  the  city  was  protected  by a  fortification wall (for which see H elly  ( 1973)  23\u00ad28  with map  i)  which  incorporated  all  three  hills  in  the  fortified area. The  area  enclosed  measured  c. 6  ha.  For  two  Classical  second-order  sites  in  the  territory,  see  Helly  ( 1973)  39\u00ad47. Gonnoi 147  (C 3?)  attests  to  a  cult  of  Athena  Polias  and  SEG 35  567  (c. 300)  to one  of  Athena  Patroia;  Gonnoi 158  (C 4f)  is  a dedication  to  Apollo  Pythios,  and  Gonnoi 162  (C 4l/C3e)  is one  to  Artemis.  Asklepios  is  attested  by  SEG 35  565  (C 4)  and Gonnoi 199  (C 3),  Ennodia  by  Gonnoi 201  (C 3)  and  Herakles by 202  (C 3). thessalia  and  adjacent  regions  723 Gonnos  struck  bronze  coins  in  C 4.

The  toponym  is  not  recorded  in  Greek sources,  but  is  given  as  Malloea  by  Livy  31.41,  36.10,  etc., which  with  the  city-ethnic  (infra)  suggests  ,  .The city-ethnic  is  (SEG 29  546.13  ( 375\u00ad350)). No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Malloia  a  polis,but two  men  from  the  city  are  listed  under  the  heading in  an  inscription  of 375\u00ad350  which  has  been interpreted  as  a  catalogue  of  Perrhaibian  polities  making  a dedication  to Apollo  and  which  includes  such  Perrhaibian communities  as  Phalanna  and  Gonnoi  (SEG 29  546);  note also  SEG 35  636  (C 5s),  an  epitaph  that  uses  about  the deceased,  which  presumably  indicates  that  he  died  while  in office and suggests the e xistence  of  magistracies  at  Malloia. Malloia  was  a  Perrhaibian  city  (Livy  31.41,  36.10,  etc.)  situ- ated  at  the  site  of  Margara  north-west  of  the  village  of Palaiokastro  (Lucas  ( 1995)  124  and  map  at  130).  It is record- ed  in  SEG 29  546  ( 375\u00ad350),  a  list  of  Perrhaibian  polities making  a  joint  dedication  to  Apollo  Pythios  at  Oloosson.  A circuit  wall  is  visible  at  the  site,  but  the  city  remains  to  be investigated  archaeologically.  (For  C 5  coins  of  the Perrhaibians,  see  the  entry  for  Oloosson.) 465.

The  city- ethnic was  originally  restored  in  SEG 29  546.14 ( [  ] ),  and  this  form  is  found  also  in  Syll. \u00b2793 (presumably  C 3e);  however,  Knoepfler has suggested r estor- ing ( [];  cf.  SEG 33  457),  a  form  also found  in  C 4s  (BE  ( 1994)  111);  apart  from  Syll. \u00b2793  (presum- ably  C 3e),  later  sources  invariably  have  (IG ix.1 689.9;  Gonnoi 69.6  (both  C 2e)). No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Mondaia  a  polis,but two  men  from  the  city  are  listed  under  the  heading [  ] vel [  ] in  an  inscription  of 375\u00ad350  which  has  been  interpreted  as  a  catalogue  of Perrhaibian  polities  making  a  joint  dedication  to  Apollo Pythios  at  Oloosson  and  which  includes  such  Perrhaibian communities  as  Phalanna  and  Gonnoi  (SEG 29  546). Mondaia  is  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  Gonnoi 69.7 ( 178)  while  Syll. \u00b2793  (presumably  C 3e)  terms  the  communi- ty []  .  The  external  collective use  of the  city-ethnic  occurs  on  C 4s  stamped  tiles  found  in  Pella (BE  ( 1994)  111),as  well  as  in  SEG 29  546  ( 375\u00ad350).In  230\u00ad220 a  citizen  of  Mondaia  may  have  served  as  Delphic  theorodokos (BCH 45  ( 1921)  v.C(b).6),  but  certainty  is  impossible,  since the  first letter is illegible,  which  means  that  [K]ondaia,  a  city of  the  Larisaian  plain,  is  also  a  possible  reading  (Lucas  ( 1997) 87). Mondaia  was  a  Perrhaibian  city  and  is  recorded  in  SEG 29 546  ( 375\u00ad350),  a  list  of  Perrhaibian  polities  making  a  joint dedication  to  Apollo  Pythios.  It  was  situated  at  the  site  of Kastri,  east  of  the  village  of  Loutro  Elassonas  (Lucas  ( 1997) 155,199\u00ad201  with  map  at  130).At  the  site,  remains  of  walls  are visible  on  the  acropolis  and  in  the  lower  city;  on  the  acropo- lis  are  remains  of  fine buildings as w ell  (autopsy  by  G.  Lucas). The  patron  divinity  was  presumably  Themis,  in  whose sanctuary  documents  were  published  (Gonnoi 69;  cf.  Syll. \u00b2 793).  Syll. \u00b2793  (presumably  C 3e)  records  a  consultation  by Mondaia  of  the  oracle  at  Dodona.  (For  C 5  coins  of  the Perrhaibians,  see  the  entry  for  Oloosson.) 466.  Mylai  (Mylaios) Map  55.  Lat. 39.45,long.  22.05.  Size of  territory: 2.Type:  C  (classified as a fort/tower b y Barr.,  but see  infra).  The  toponym  is  , (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iii.134 ( 230\u00ad220);  Steph.  Byz. 461.9).  The  city-ethnic  is   (SEG 29  546.9  ( 375\u00ad350)). No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Mylai  a  polis,but three  men  from  the  city  are  listed  under  the  heading in  an  inscription  of 375\u00ad350  which  has  been  inter- preted  as  a  catalogue  of  Perrhaibian  polities  making  a  joint dedication  to  Apollo  Pythios  at  Oloosson  and  which includes  such  Perrhaibian  communities  as  Phalanna  and Gonnoi  (SEG 29  546).In  230\u00ad220,a  citizen  of  Mylai  served  as Delphic  theorodokos  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iii.134). Mylai  was  a  Perrhaibian  city,  and  it  is  recorded  in  SEG 29 546  ( 375\u00ad350),  a  list  of  Perrhaibian  polities  making  a  joint dedication  to  Apollo  Pythios.  (For  C 5  coins  of  the Perrhaibians,  see  the  entry  for  Oloosson).  Mylai  was  situat- ed  at  Kastri,  north  of  the  village  of  Vlachogianni  (Lucas ( 1995)  122).  To the  north  its  territory bordered  on  that  of Malloia,  to  the  north-west  on  that  of  Chyretiai,  to  the  south- east  on  that  of  Phalanna,  to the  south  on  that  of  Erikinion, and  to  the  west  on  the  territories  of  Phakion  and  Oxyneia. See  the  map  at  Lucas  ( 1995)  130.  The  acropolis  of  Mylai  was enclosed  by  a  wall;  it  runs  for  c. 400  m  and  is  constructed  in large  irregular  blocks  which  do  not  join;  there  may  have been  an  entrance  in  the  south-east,  and  gates  or  sally-ports were  possibly  located  to  the  south  and  north-west;  and  a 724 decourt,  nielsen,  helly  et  al. ruined  square  tower  (possibly  Hellenistic)  was  found  on  the highest  point  of  the  wall  (autopsy  by  G.  Lucas).  To  the  north a  wall  is  seen  descending  towards  the  city  wall,  though  no trace  of  the  latter  has  been  found  (autopsy  by G.  Lucas).  In the  centre  of  the  acropolis  are  the  foundations  of  a  rectan- gular  building;  and  there  are  numerous  traces  of  habitation to  the  west,  north-west  and  south-west  (autopsy  by  G.  Lucas). 467.  Oloosson  (Oloossonios) Map  55.  Lat. 39.55,long. 22.20.  Size  of  territory: 2.  Type:  B.  The  toponym  is ',  (Hom.  Il. 2.739;  Eust.  Il. 520.25), ' (Gonnoi 93.B.23  (C 3l);  Strabo  9.5.19).  The  city-ethnic  is '  (Gonnoi 11.3  (C 3f),  and  presumably  C 4  coins (infra)). No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Oloosson  a  polis,but it  is  included  as  a  probable  polis  here  because  ( 1)  it  struck coins  in  C 4,  and  ( 2)  it  is  highly  likely  that  [ ' (gen.  pl.)]  should  be  restored  in  SEG 29  546.4,  an  inscription of 375\u00ad350  found  at  Oloosson  which  has  been  interpreted  as a  catalogue  of  Perrhaibian  polities  making  a  dedication  to Apollo  Pythios  and  which  includes  such  Perrhaibian  com- munities  as  Phalanna  and  Gonnoi.  Oloosoon  is  called  a  polis in  the  political  sense  in  Gonnoi 18.14  (C 3l).  The  internal  collective  city-ethnic  is  abbreviated  on  C 4  coins  (infra)  and has  been  restored  at  SEG 29  546.4  ( 375\u00ad350).  The  external individual  use  is  found  in  Gonnoi 11.3  and  SEG 23  455  (both C 3f).  In  C 3s  Gonnoi  conferred  proxenia  and  other  privileges upon  two  citizens  of  Oloosson  (Gonnoi 11,  18). Oloosson  was  Perrhaibian  (Strabo  9.5.19;  though  Steph. Byz. 490.11  places  it  in  Magnesia,  presumably  confusing  it with  Magnesian  Olizon,  which  at  489.14  he  places  in Thessalia).  It  was  situated  at  modern  Elasson,  and  in  375\u00ad350 it  was  probably  listed  in  SEG 29  546  (cf.  app.  crit.),  a  list found  at  Oloosson  itself  and  cataloguing  Perrhaibian  poli- ties  making  a  joint  dedication  to  Apollo  Pythios  at Oloosson.  Oloosson  was  presumably  a  leading  city  of  the Perrhaibian  ethnos  if  the  hypothesis  that  the  C 5  silver coinage  of  the  Perrhaibians  (infra)  was  struck  by  Oloosson is  accepted  (Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 4327\u00ad28;  Liampi  ( 1996)  119); for  the  similarities  between  these  coins  and  contemporary coins  of  Krannon,  Larisa,  Pharkadon,  Trikka,  Pherai  and  Skotoussa,  see  Kraay  ( 1976)  115\u00ad16  and  Martin  ( 1985) 36\u00ad37. An  unpublished  inscription  (C 3s)  mentions  a  sanctuary of  Asklepios,  and  on  the  basis  of  coin  types  a  cult  of  Zeus may  be  assumed  as  well.  SEG 29  546,  a  joint  dedication  to Apollo  Pythios  by  the  Perrhaibian  polities,  was  found  in Oloosson.  On  the  northern  slope  of  the  acropolis  traces  of an  isodomic  wall  are  visible  (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  24). The  C 5  silver  and  C 4  bronze  coinage  of  the  Perrhaibians was  probably  struck  by  Oloosson  (Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 4 327\u00ad28):  ( 1)  Silver,  denominations:  drachm,  triobol,  tri- hemiobol,  obol  and  hemiobol  on  the  Aiginetan  standard; types:  obv.  young  man  restraining  a  bull,  or  forepart  of  bull, or  horseman,  or  galloping  horse,  or  head  of  Athena;  rev.gal- loping  horse,  or  forepart  of  horse,  or  Athena  running,  or horse's  head;  legend: or .(2) Bronze:  obv.  veiled Hera  facing;  rev.

In  C 4 Oloosson  struck  its  own  bronze  coins:  obv.  horseman;  rev. Zeus  brandishing  thunderbolt;  legend: () (Lavva  ( 1994)). 468.  Phalanna  (Phalannaios) Map  55.  Lat. 39.45,long. 22.10.  Size  of  territory: 2.  Type:  [A].  The  toponym  is ,  in  SEG 38  649  (C 4)  (cf.Voutiras  ( 1991));  BCH 45 ( 1921)  v.43  ( 230\u00ad220);  and  Strabo  9.5.19.According  to Steph. Byz. 655.20,  Ephoros  (  FGrHist 70)  fr. 62  used  the  toponym (cf.  Eust.  Il. 520.18: ).  Hecat.  fr. 5  is quoted  by  Steph.  Byz. 655.19  for  the  variant  name  `, which  is  taken  by  Jacoby  (ad  loc.)  to  be  a  variant  name  not  of the  city,  but  of  the  eponymous  heroine  Phalanna.  According to Strabo 9.5.15,  \"some\"  ( ) used the to ponym   (cf.  Hom.  Il. 2.739)  about  the  acropolis  of  Phalanna,  where- as  Ael.  Herod.  De  pros.  cath. 3.1,  321.5  takes  to be a    , \u00b5,  ,  .However,acc ording  to Eust.  Il. 1.520.28,Korsea  was another  name  for  the  acropolis.  The  city-ethnic  was (C 4  coins,  infra;  SEG 29  546.6  ( 375\u00ad350);  CID ii 32.45  (C 4l));  an  inscription  from  Argos  uses  (IG iv  617.12  ( 316\u00ad293)). No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  explicitly  describes Phallana  as  a  polis;  but  the  political  sense  is  indirectly  attest- ed  in  the  Delphic  accounts  of 337/6  (CID ii  74),  where  a tamias  of  Phalanna  is  recorded  ( i.48)  after  the  heading   \u00b5   \u00b5    ( i.4).  For  an  explicit  attes- tation,  see  ArchEph  ( 1916)  18,272,1  (C 3e);IG  ix.2  1228.a13,b17 (C 3)  has  in  ll. 17\u00ad18.The  term  ( ) in  the  sense  of  \"citizen\"  is  found  in  a  C 5  law  (IG ix.2  1226.a3) which  describes  itself  as  a  \u00b5  (a 1)  and  refers  to  []  \u00b5  (a 6\u00ad7).  Phalanna  is  described  as  in  SEG 38  649  (C 4);  cf.  Voutiras  ( 1991). The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on C 4  coins  (infra)  and  in  ArchEph  ( 1916)  18,  272,  1  (C 3e).  The thessalia  and  adjacent  regions  725 external  collective  use  is  found  in  SEG 29  546.6  ( 375\u00ad350) and  IG iv  617.12  ( 316\u00ad293),  an  inscription  recording  a collective  donation  of  money  by  the  Phalannians  (see  fur- ther  Perlman  ( 2000)  74,  127\u00ad29).  The  external  individual use  is  found  in  CID ii  32.45  (C 4l),  74.i.48  ( 337/6),  77.i.9 ( 334/3),  96.7  ( 327/6),  100.i.9  ( 325/4),  102.i.10  ( 324/3). Phalanna  was  a  Perrhaibian  city  (CID ii  77.i.9,  96.7),  and it  is  listed  in  SEG 29  546  ( 375\u00ad350),  a  list  of  Perrhaibian  poli- ties  making  a  joint  dedication  to  Apollo  Pythios  at Oloosson.  (For  C 5  coins  of  the  Perrhaibians,  see  the  entry for  Oloosson.)  It  was  probably  situated  at  Damasi  (Lucas ( 1995)  122  with  map  at  130). Citizens  of  Phalanna  served  the  Amphiktyonic  League on  behalf  of  the  Perrhaibians  as  hieromnemones  (CID ii 32.45  (C 4l),  96.7  ( 327/6),  100.i.9  ( 325/4),  102.i.10  ( 324/3)) and  as  tamiai  (CID ii  74.i.9  ( 337/6),  77.9  ( 334/3)).  With  the other  Perrhaibian  communities,  Phalanna  in 375\u00ad350  made a  dedication  to  Apollo  Pythios  at  Oloosson  (SEG 29  546). IG iv  617.4  ( 316\u00ad293)  records  a  monetary  donation  by Phalanna  \"to  the sent  out  from  Argos  to  announce the  celebration  of  the  Nemean  Games  and  the  Heraia\" (Perlman  ( 2000)  74,  127\u00ad29).  In 230\u00ad220  a  citizen  of Phalanna  served  as  Delphic  theorodokos  (BCH 45  ( 1921) v.43). The  earliest  public  enactment  is  a  C 5  law  ( \u00b5) con- cerning  public  finances ( IG ix.2  1226).  Hellenistic  inscrip- tions  refer  to  several  officials ( ArchEph  ( 1916)  18,272,1  (C 3e); IG ix.2  1233  (C 3)). A  theatre  is  mentioned  in  a  C 2  inscription  (IG ix.2  1230), and  recent  explorations  have  revealed  traces  of  a  polygonal wall  on  the  acropolis  (autopsy  by G.  Lucas),  but  apart  from that  there  is  no  evidence  for  the  urban  centre.

The  toponym  is  , (IG iv\u00b2.194.b.ii.39  (post- 316))  or  (F.Delphes iii.4417.iii.5  (c. 257/3)); is  found  in  late  literary sources  (Plut.  Aem. 15.2;  Ptol.  Geog. 3.12.39).  The  city-ethnic is ,  but  attested  only  in  the  Hellenistic  period (SEG 36  554.4  (C 2f)). No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Pythoion  a  polis,but it  may  possibly  have  been  one:  according  to  Livy 42.53.5,it was  one  of  the  three  oppida  making  up  the  Perrhaibian Tripolis  (&lt;Perseus&gt;  descendit  ad  Azorum,  Pythoum, Dolichen:  tripolim  vocant  incolentes  haec  tria  oppida),  an association  for  which  C 4f  bronze  coins  are  attested  (infra). If  the  name  Tripolis  means  that  the  constituent  communi- ties  were  poleis,  then  Pythoion  was  a  polis.  Furthermore,  in C 4l  a  citizen  of  Pythoion  served  as  Epidaurian  theorodokos (IG iv\u00b2.194i.b.39).  Pythoion  calls  itself  in  a  C 2f  proxeny  decree  (SEG 36  552.4).  A coin  inscribed is  a  forgery  (Lucas  ( 1997) 77). Pythoion  was  situated  on  the  hill  of  Ag.  Apostoli  south  of the  present  village  of  Pythion,  formerly  Selos  (Lucas  ( 1997) 182\u00ad85).  Though  geographically  located  in  Perrhaibia  (Plut. Aem. 15.2),Pythoion  (like  Azoros  and  Doliche,  with  which  it formed  the  Perrhaibian  Tripolis)  is  absent  from  the  list  of Perrhaibian  polities  in  SEG 29  546  ( 375\u00ad350;  cf.  Lucas  ( 1997) 80\u00ad81);  this  fact  (and  the  fact  that  the  dispute  between Doliche  and  Eleimiotis  was  settled  by  the  Makedonian  king, s.v.  Doliche)  suggests  that  in  C 4e  the  Tripolis  was  under Makedonian  rule  (Lucas  ( 1997)  80\u00ad81,  211\u00ad16).  In  addition, the  Epidaurian  list  of  theorodokoi  (IG iv\u00b2.194  I.b. 39  (post- 316))  seems  to  record  Pythoion  in  the  Makedonian  section (Lucas  ( 1997)  81\u00ad82),  and  F.Delphes iii.4417.iii.5  (c. 257\u00ad253) is  a  grant  of  proxeny  to a  man  described  as   '[]\u00b5 [ ]   ;  Steph.  Byz. 538.21  also locates  it  in  Makedonia;  another  passage  of  Steph.  Byz. ( 157.12\u00ad13)  possibly  attests  to  the  settlement  of  Makedonians in  Pythoion  in  C 4\u00adC3:    \"  \u00b5    \u00b5  \"(see Lucas (1997)  76,  216). A  temple  of  Apollo  Pythios,  the  patron  divinity,  is  men- tioned  in  a  C 2m  inscription  (SEG 36  552;  cf.  Plut.  Aem. 15.10), and  recent  excavations  have  unearthed  two  temples  of Roman  date  (ArchDelt 51  ([ 1996]  2001)  364). The  acropolis  was  surrounded  by  a  wall  constructed  in small  flat stones (Lucas ( 1997)  183\u00ad84).  A  wall  surrounding the  lower  city,  probably  isodomic  to judge  from  the  visible remains,  has  recently  been  located,  but  is  as  yet  unpublished and  undated.

No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Argethia  a  polis,but it is  included  as  a  possible  polis  here  on  account  of  SGDI 1341,a C 4s  grant  of  proxeny  by the  Molossoi  to a  man  of  Argethia ([ ]   \u00b5   []  [] ).  In  c. 230\u00ad220,  a  citizen  of  Argethia  served  as Delphic  theorodokos  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iii.132). The  city  was  situated  on  the  east  side  of  Mt.  Pindos,  in Athamania  (or  Thessalia,  the  exact  border  between  the  two regions  being  unclear);  the  site  is  at  Hellinika,  c. 2  km  west  of modern  Argithea  (formerly  Knisovo,  in  the  nomos  of Karditsa).  There  are  traces  of  a  Hellenistic  circuit  wall (Indzesiloglou  ( 1987)  345)  and  a  Classical\u00adHellenistic  ceme- tery (ArchDelt 43  ([ 1988])  252). thessalia  and  adjacent  regions  727", "Argoussa": "Identifier: 143.7., (Argoussios) Map  55.

The  city-ethnic  is  (IG ix\u00b2  1.1 31.A.103;  cf.  SEG 33  447  (C 3)). No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Argoussa  a  polis,but it deserves  inclusion  in  this  Inventory  as  a  probable  polis  on account  of  the  C 5f  inscription  published  in  ArchEph ( 1934\u00ad35)  140\u00ad45  (cf.  Helly  ( 1979a)):  it  describes  itself  as  a \u00b5  of  the  damos  (l. 1),  refers  to  a  local  board  of  tagoi  (ll. 7\u00ad8)  and  to  Athena  Polias  (ll. 11\u00ad12).  Cf.  Helly  ( 1995)  30\u00ad31. The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  in  the abbreviated  legends  ( ) of  C 3  coins  (Franke  ( 1955)).

The  exact  location  of  Phaloria  is  unknown,  but  it  must have  been  situated  in  Hestiaiotis.  Some  travellers  (e.g. Bursian  ( 1862)  49;  Heuzey  and  Daumet  ( 1876)  413)  located  it at  the  site  of  Skoumbos  near  Megarchi,  south  of  Kalambaka. At  the  site  are  important  architectural  remains  (of  walls,  a tower,  a  lower  city)  and  a  cemetery;  these  remains  attest  to the  existence  of  a  city,  occupied  at  least  during  the  Classical period.  However,  most  travellers  (e.g.  St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  124; Philippson  ( 1950)  275;Meyer,  RE  suppl.  x  s.v.)  have  identi- fied this site w ith  Pialeia  (cf.  n. 4).  Following  Philippson ( 1950)  305  (who  himself  followed  St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  114),  who seems  not  to  have  examined  the  site),  Barr.  prefers  a  location at  Meritsa  (now  Oxynia)  where,  however,  (unpublished) surveys  conducted  in  1991\u00ad92  by  Darmezin,  Decourt  et al. failed  to  locate  ancient  remains.  Another  possible  location  is at  Nea  Koutsouphliani  near  Malakasi  (cf.  Hammond  ( 1967) 260  and 681),  where  quarrying  has  unfortunately  destroyed the  ancient  site  (unpublished  survey  by  Darmezin,  Decourt et al.). No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Phaloria  a  polis,  and the  reason  for  its  inclusion  in  this  Inventory  is  the  existence of  bronze  coins  dated  to 302\u00ad286  by  both  Head,  HN \u00b2  305 and  Rogers  ( 1932)  149\u00ad50;if  these  coins  are  correctly  dated  to C 4l,  the  presumption  is  that  Phaloria  possibly  existed  as  a polis  prior  to  their  minting,  i.e.  in  C 4s.In  271\u00ad270  a  Thessalos Phaloriastas  was  awarded  proxeny  by the  Aitolian  koinon (IG ix.1\u00b2  13.31),and  in  230\u00ad220  a  Delphic  theorodokos  resided in  the  city.

No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Methylion  a  polis,  but it  merits  inclusion  in  this  Inventory  because  ( 1)  it  minted coins  in  C 5\u00adC4  (infra);  ( 2)  a  man  of  Methylion  served  as Delphic  theorodokos  in 230\u00ad220  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iii.29);  ( 3) some  C 3  tiles  are  stamped  with  the  collective city-ethnic (infra);  cf.  also  Biesantz  ( 1965)  140  n. 235  for  an--undated-- inscription:  \u00b5  (C 5?).  The  only Classical  source  attesting  to  the  existence  and  status  of Methylion  is  its  C 5\u00adC4m  coinage. Methylion  was  situated  in  Thessalia  (Steph.  Byz. 440.16 s.v. ,  where  the  passage     ,     possibly  refers  to Methylion),  more precisely  in  Thessaliotis  (Heyman  ( 1970);  Helly  ( 1995) 165,  229\u00ad30).  It  is  probably  to  be  located  at  the  village  of Myrina  near  Prodomos  Karditsis,  whence  come  C 3  tiles stamped (information  kindly  provided  by C.  Indzesiloglou).  A  cult  of  Athena  is  presumably  indicated by  the  coin  types  depicting  this  goddess  (Heyman  ( 1970) nos. 6\u00ad7).

Peirasia  is  listed  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  at  Thuc. 2.22.2.  Similarly,  in  the  Delphic  naopoioi's  accounts  the Peirasians  are  recorded  in  a  fragmentary  list  (CID ii  8.ii.6), the  heading  of  which  undoubtedly  included  the  formula:  \u00b5    (CID ii  5.ii.25\u00ad26)  vel  sim.The internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  on  C 4 coins  (infra),  and  the  external  collective use  in  Thuc. 2.22.2 and  CID ii  8.ii.6  (c. 360/59).

In  Ps.-Skylax 64,  where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense, Pelinna(ion)  is  the  seventh  of  nine  toponyms  listed  between the  heading  and  the  addendum       ,  and  Diod. 18.11.1  (r 323)  by  impli- cation  describes  Pelinna(ion)  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense. Strabo  9.5.17  calls  it  a  phrourion  in  an  achronic  reference. The  internal  collective  use  of  the  (abbreviated)  city-ethnic  is found  on  C 4  coins  (infra);  the  external  collective  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  found  in  Polyaen. 4.2.19  (r 356)  and  Diod. 18.11.1 (r 323).  The  external  individual  use  is  found  repeatedly  in CID ii,  e.g. 24.i.13  ( 336/5),  31.73  ( 345/4),  32.10  ( 340/39). Pelinna(ion)  was  a  Thessalian  city  (Ps.-Skylax  64);  Steph. Byz. 515.3  locates  it  in  Phthiotis,  but  Strabo  9.5.17  in Hestiaiotis,  which  is  more  likely  to  be  correct.  It  was  situated at  Palaiogardiki  on  the  left  bank  of  the  Peneios, 3  km  north- east  of  Petroporo  and  14  km  east  of  Trikala  (see,  however, infra  Pharkadon).  The  acropolis  was  separately  walled:  the wall  is  a  C 5  polygonal  structure  running  for  1,630  m  and  has square  towers  (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1938);  Tziaphalias  ( 1992)  124\u00ad31). The  lower  city  was  enclosed  by  a  C 4  wall  descending  from the  northernmost  point  of  the  acropolis  wall;  it  runs  for 2,600  m  and  encloses  an  area  of 59  ha  south  of  the  acropolis (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1938)  335);  it  has  numerous  towers  and  three  gates (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1938);  Tziaphalias  ( 1992)  124\u00ad31).  In  the  lower  city are  undated  remains  of  such  public  constructions  as  stoas (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1938)),  temples  (ibid.;  Tziaphalias  ( 1992)  125\u00ad27), cisterns  (Tziaphalias  ( 1992)  125),  and  possibly  a  theatre (St\u00e4hlin  ( 1938)  335).  Traces  of  a  C 4  Hippodamian  grid  plan are  found  as  well  (Tziaphalias  ( 1992)  126\u00ad27). The  history  of  the  city  is  almost  unknown,  but  Polyaen. 4.2.19  (r 356)  mentions  a  war  between  Pelinna(ion)  and Pharsalos  (in  which  both  seem  to  have  had  allies  and  in which  Philip  II  of  Makedon  played  a  part  (Hammond  ( 1994) 48)),  and  according  to  Diod. 18.11.1,  Pelinna(ion)  was  the only  Thessalian  city  that  did  not  join  the  Hellenic  alliance  in the  Lamian  War;  so  it  seems  to  have  favoured  Makedonia.  IG iv  617.11  ( 316\u00ad293)  records  a  monetary  donation  by  Pelinna \"to  the  sent  out  from  Argos  to  announce  the  cele- bration  of  the  Nemean  Games  and  the  Heraia\"  (Perlman ( 2000)  74,  127\u00ad29).  A  citizen  of  Pelinna  possibly  served  as theorodokos  for  Epidauros  in  360/59  (Perlman  ( 2000)  E. 1  fr. b 1,  printed  as  [];  note,  however,  that  IG iv\u00b2.1 94/95.1b.1  prints  this  entry  as  `). Citizens  of  Pelinna(ion)  served  the  Amphiktyonic  League  in  various  capacities: (CID ii  24.i.13 ( 336/5));  naopoios  (ibid. 31.73  ( 345/4),32.10  ( 340/39);  hierom- nemon  (ibid. 96.3,  97.57  (both 327/6),  32.42  (C 4l)).  In  498, Hippokleas  of  Pelinna(ion)  was  victorious  in  the  Pythian double  stadium  race  (Pind.  Pyth. 10);  in  C 6l  his  father 700 decourt,  nielsen,  helly  et  al. Phrikias  was  a  double  Olympionikes  (Olympionikai 150,156), and  Hippokleas  himself  later  likewise  became  a  double Olympionikes  (Olympionikai 175,  184). Coin  types  indicate  a  cult  of  the  sibyl  Manetho,  and  ivy- shaped  gold  leaves  one  of  Dionysos  (Tziaphalias  ( 1992) 136\u00ad37).

The  political  sense  is  found  at  Diod. 15.75.1  (r 367).  The  earliest  epigraphical  reference  to  a   is in a citizenship decree of  C 4l\u00adC3e  (SEG 43 310).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internal- ly  on  coins  of  C 5\u00adC4  (infra)  and  in  the  decree  SEG 43  310; externally  it  is  found  at  Xen.  Hell. 4.3.3.  The  external  individ- ual  use  is  found  in  SEG 34  452  (C 4)  and  CID ii  10.A.i.8  ( 357/6). Skotoussa  was  situated  in  Thessalia  (IG ii\u00b2  8843  (C 4f); Xen.  Hell. 4.3.3),more  precisely  in  Pelasgiotis  (Simon.  fr. 127, Page;  Kineas  (FGrHist 603)  fr. 3).  Its  territory included  the river  Onchestos  (Polyb. 17.20.5),  Kynos  Kephalai  (hills and/or  kome:Polyb. 18.22.9;Strabo 9.5.20),  Melambion (another  kome?:  Polyb. 18.20.6)  and  a  hill,  Phagoeis  (schol. Hom.  Il. 16.233 );  none  of  these  toponyms  can  be  equated with  sites  on  the  ground.  Skotoussa  was  bounded  to  the north  by  the  crest  line  of  the  Revenia  hills,  to  the  east  by  the territory  of  Pherai,  and  to the  south  by the  territories  of Eretria  Phthiotis  and,  in  particular,  Pharsalos  (Decourt ( 1990)  fig. 27). Alongside  Larisa,  Krannon  and  Pharsalos,  Skotoussa  is mentioned  by  Xen.  Hell. 4.3.3  as  being  allied  to  the  Boiotians in 395/4.  Later  in  C 4  Skotoussa  was  conquered  by Alexander of  Pherai,  who  in  367/6  summoned  a  meeting  of  the  ekklesia (Diod. 15.75.1)  to  be  held  in  the  theatre  (Paus. 6.5.2;  cf. St\u00e4hlin  ( 1924a)  109,  and  Dilke  ( 1948)  138\u00ad39),  whereupon  he had  his  mercenaries  kill  all  the  participants. A  citizen  of  Skotoussa  was  appointed  as  proxenos  by Pherai  in  C 4  (SEG 23  419),  and  one  by  Delphi  c. 320  (SEG 18 179). Skotoussa  was  a  walled  and  fortified city in  367  (Diod. 15.75.1),but  there  are  no  visible  remains  of  the  Classical  wall, the  preserved  remains  being  Hellenistic  (Missailidou- Despotidou  ( 1993)).  Remains  of  a  wall  enclosing  the  acrop- olis  in  the  south-western  corner  of  the  city  could  still  be  seen by  Leake  in  1809,  but  were  already  badly  preserved  (Leake ( 1835)  iv. 454ff). Skotoussa  had  cults  of  Apollo  Kerdoios  (Missailidou- Despotidou  ( 1993)  A 71),  Asklepios  (ibid.

At Ps.-Skylax  35  Kalydon  is  the  first of three  toponyms  listed  after  the  heading      ,  where  the  term  polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense. The  earliest  epigraphical  reference  to  a  is  on  a  C 2  statue  base  (IG ix\u00b2.1140.1). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  a  dedication  of  C 5l  (SEG 32  550,  partly  restored)  as  well  as in  the  public  seal  (Pantos  ( 1985)  no. 238;  cf.  Pantos  ( 1988), undated),  and  externally  in  Xen.  Hell. 4.6.1.  The  individual and  external  use  is  attested  in  an  Athenian  citizenship  decree for  Thrasyboulos  of  Kalydon  (Lys. 13.71;  cf.  IG i\u00b3  102  add. 946). In  the  Catalogue  of  Ships  Kalydon  is  recorded  as  an Aitolian  city  (Il. 2.640),  but  it  can  be  inferred  from  Thuc. 3.102.5  that  in  C 6/C5  Kalydon  had  parted  company  with  the other  Aitolians.  Originally  an  independent  polis,Kalydon became  in  C 5/C4  a  member  of  the  Early  Achaian  Federation and  in  389  Kalydon  was  besieged  by  the  Akarnanians  and their  allies  (Xen.  Hell. 4.6.1\u00ad4);  but  in  367/6  Epameinondas expelled  the  Achaian  garrison  from  Kalydon  (Diod. 15.75.1\u00ad2),  whereafter  the  city  seems  to  have  joined  the Aitolian  Federation  (Buckler  ( 1980)  188\u00ad91;  Merker  ( 1989); Bommelj\u00e9  ( 1988)  310).  A  pair  of  damiourgoi  served  as eponymic  officials ( IG ix\u00b2.1138  (C 4l));  cf.  Veligianni-Terzi ( 1977)  64f;  Sherk  ( 1990)  260).  In,  probably, 355,  theorodokoi were  appointed  to  host  theoroi  from  Epidauros  (IG iv\u00b21  95.7). According  to  Thucydides,  Kalydon  and  its  neighbour Pleuron  were  situated  near  the  Corinthian  Gulf  in  the northern  part  of  the  littoral  in  the  region  called   (Thuc. 3.102.5;  Hsch.  s.v.  \u00b5).  According  to Strabo  10.2.21  and  Plin.  HN 4.6,  Kalydon  was  situated  7.5 Roman  miles  from  the  coast,  near  the  river  Euenos.  The  city possessed  its  own  harbour  at  the  coast  (Paus. 7.21.5;  cf. Freitag  ( 2000)  40\u00ad52). Kalydon  is  securely  identified w ith  the  ancient  settlement at  the  spur  of  Mt.  Arakynthos  c. 9  km  east  of  Messolonghion; and  the  archaeological  investigation  of  the  remains  shows that,  as  early  as  the  Archaic  period,  the  city  had  close  cultur- al  connections  with  the  other  centres  of  the  Corinthian Gulf,  especially  Corinth. A  C 4  defence  circuit  of  c. 4  km  with  gates  and  towers encloses  a  settlement  situated  on  and  between  two  hills  of which  the  western  constituted  a  separately  fortified acropo- lis  with  a  citadel.  The  walls  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 25  ha.  Of  the ancient  remains  the  most  important  are  the  temples  of Artemis  Laphria  (C 7,rebuilt  several  times),  Apollo  Laphrios and  Dionysos,  all  situated  in  a  suburban  temenos  a  little  to the  south  of  the  city.  On  the  archaeological  evidence,  see  von Geisau  ( 1919);  Poulsen  and  Rhomaios  ( 1927)  50f;  Dyggve  et al.( 1934);  Dyggve  ( 1948),(1951);  Knell  ( 1973)  448\u00ad53.See  also AR  ( 2001\u00ad2)  44\u00ad45  for  the  new  Danish\u00adGreek  excavations  at the  site. The  principal  cult  of  Kalydonian  Artemis  Laphria  goes back  to  the  Archaic  period  (Paus. 4.31.7,  7.18.8\u00ad19.1,  7.20.2); the  sanctuary  of  Apollo  Laphrios  is  attested  through  a  C 6 boundary  stone  (IG ix\u00b2.1149;  cf.  Strabo  10.2.21).  A  cult  of Zeus  Soter  is  mentioned  in  Hellenistic  manumission records (IG ix\u00b2.1137.86  (C 2m);  SEG 25  621.8  (C 2)),  and Pausanias  ( 7.21.1)  has  a  reference  to a  cult  of  Dionysos Kalydonios  (Antonetti  ( 1990)  241\u00ad69).  Stelai  inscribed  with public  documents  were  set  up  in  the  sanctuary  of  Laphreion (IG ix\u00b2.1  170.4  (C 4l/3e);  186.6\u00ad7  (C 3l)). 149.

Strabo  wavers  between  polichnion  ( 10.2.4)  and polis  ( 10.2.21;  cf.  Steph.  Byz. 429.16),  and  at  10.2.6  he  criticis- es  Hellanikos  (fr. 118)  for  classifying  Makynea  as  a  polis founded  in  the  Heroic  Age.  That  Makynea  was  a  polis  in  the Classical  period  is  indicated  by  a  C 4  proxeny  decree  from Delphi,  in  which  the  individual  and  external  use  of  the  city- ethnic  is  attested  (Bourguet  ( 1899)  356  no. 2: [    ];  cf.  Sordi  ( 1969)  356;Funke ( 1997)  161). Makynea  seems  originally  to  have  been  a  Lokrian  com- munity  (Plut.  Mor. 294E;  cf.  Lerat  ( 1952)  i. 7,  34f),  but by C 5 it  had  become  part  of  Aitolia  (Hohmann  ( 1908)  17f; Bosworth  ( 1974)  177). Makynea  was  situated  in  the  borderland  between  Aitolia and  Lokris  near  Cape  Rhion  at  the  eastern  spur  of  Mt. Taphiassos  (modern  Klokova).  A  suggested  identification is with  Palaiokastro  at  Mamaku,  c. 3  km  north-west  of  Rhion. Here  are  the  remains  of  a  fortified settlement of  C 4(?)/C3 with  a  theatre  extra  muros  (Woodhouse  ( 1897/1973)  327; Lerat  ( 1952)  i. 82\u00ad84,  189\u00ad91;  Bommelj\u00e9  ( 1987)  95;  Bommelj\u00e9 and  Vroom  ( 1995)  94). 384 freitag,  funke  and  moustakis 150.

The  city-ethnic  is (Hom.  Il. 23.635;  IG ix\u00b2.13A.17  (C 3);  Strabo 10.2.24). Pleuron  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Bacchylides at  Ep. 5.149\u00ad51;  cf.  Daimachos  (FGrHist 65)  fr. 1.  The  earliest epigraphical  reference  to a     is  on  a  C 3 statue  base  (IG ix\u00b2.170.1.)

The  individual  and external  use  is  attested  in  a  proxeny  decree  from  Delphi (Syll. \u00b3621.1\u00ad2  (C 2f)). In  the  Catalogue  of  Ships  Pleuron  is  recorded  as  an Aitolian  city  (Il. 2.639;  cf.  Visser  ( 1997)  601ff);  but  it  can  be inferred  from  Thuc. 3.102.5  that  in  C 6/C5  Pleuron  had  part- ed  company  with  the  other  Aitolians.  Pleuron  was  original- ly  an  independent  polis.  In  C 5/C4  it  became--like Kalydon--a member of  the  early  Achaian  Federation.  In C 4m/s  it  became  integrated  into  the  Aitolian  Federation,  as did  the  neighbouring  poleis  (Bommelj\u00e9  ( 1988)  302ff).  The affiliation w ith  Aitolia,  however,  is  not  explicitly  attested until  C 3,  when  citizens  of  Pleuron  repeatedly  filled federal offices (e.g.  IG ix\u00b2.113.13\u00ad14  (C 3f)). In C 3s  Pleuron  was  destroyed,  but  the  city  was  soon rebuilt  at  a  nearby  but  more  elevated  place  (Strabo  10.2.4;  cf. Ehrhardt  ( 1978)  251f.;  Funke  ( 1987)  94  with  n. 40).According to Strabo 10.2.23,  old  Pleuron  was  situated  on  the  coast between  the  rivers  Acheloos  and  Euenos  near  Kalydon  (cf. Strabo  10.2.4,  3.6).  The  settlement  has  not  yet  been  found, but  presumably  it  was  close  to new  Pleuron,  which  has  been identified w ith  the  ancient  settlement  at  modern  Kato Retsina,  on  the  southern  side  of  Mt.  Arakynthos;  cf. aitolia  385 Woodhouse  ( 1897/1973)  128ff;  Kirsten  ( 1951a);  Bommelj\u00e9 ( 1987)  104;  Antonetti  ( 1990)  281f;  Wei\u00dfl  ( 1999)  106ff.

It  is unwarranted  with  some  editors  to  delete  .  Thus, Thucydides  classified Chalkis as a polis,  primarily  in  the urban  sense,  but  the  genitive  points  to  the  polit- ical  sense  as  a  connotation.  Quoting  Hekataios,  Steph.  Byz. ( 651.13)  lists  Hypochalkis  as  a  polis,  but  it  is  uncertain whether  the  site-classification stems from H ekataios (Hansen  ( 1997)  17\u00ad18). Chalkis  is  called  Aitolian  by  Homer  (Il. 2.639)  and Alkman  (fr. 24,  Calame);  but  Thucydides'  description  of  the city  as  Corinthian  indicates  that  Chalkis  was  a  Corinthian dependency,  though  probably  not  a  colony  settled  by Corinthians  (Salmon  ( 1984)  213,  268,  277\u00ad79).  During  the later  part  of  the  Archidamian  War  Chalkis  was  controlled  by Athens  (Thuc. 2.83.3). Chalkis  was  situated  on  a  small  coastal  plain  between  M.  Chalkis  (Varassova)  and  M.  Taphiassos  (Klokova) (Strabo. 9.4.8).  On  the  coast,  upon  the  hill  Hag.  Triadha  at modern  Kato Vasiliki,  are  the  remains  of  a  defence  circuit and  some  houses  belonging  to  a  settlement  of  the  Classical and  Hellenistic  periods  (Woodhouse  ( 1897/1973)  106\u00ad14; Bommelj\u00e9  ( 1987)  112;  Antonetti  ( 1990)  283f;  Dietz  et al. ( 1998),  ( 2000)). For  the  control  of  the  Corinthian  Gulf,  Chalkis  was  a strategically  important  harbour  (Thuc. 2.83.3;  Polyb. 5.94.8; cf.  Freitag  ( 2000)  53\u00ad57).  Above  the  city  on  the  southern slope  of  M.

Agrinion  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  (Diod. 19.67.4 (r 314)).  The  individual  and  internal  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  for  citizens  serving  as  magistrates  in  the  Aitolian Confederacy  (IG ix\u00b2.1  618.3);  the  external  use  is  attested  for  a Delphic  hieromnemon  (Syll. \u00b3603.3,C2e). At 19.67.4  Diodoros  reports  that,  in  314,King  Kassander  of Macedon convened  an  ekklesia  of  the  Akarnanians  and  per- suaded  them  to  leave  the  small  and  unfortified settlements and  move  into  a  few  poleis  of  which  Stratos,  Sauria  and Agrinion  are  explicitly  mentioned.  As  a  result  the  Derieis (SEG 36  331.A.41  (C 4s);  IG iv\u00b21  96.61,  65  (C 3m))  and  other Akarnanians  were  synoecised  into  Agrinion  (Diod. 19.67.4). Shortly  afterwards  Agrinion  was  besieged  and  conquered  by the  Aitolians  (Diod. 19.68.1).  It seems  reasonable  to infer that  Agrinion  must  have  been  a  polis  during  the  last  decades of  the  Classical  period.

The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  a  preserved  specimen  of  the  seal  of  the  polis  (Pantos ( 1985)  545f),  and  externally  in  a  decree  of  C 3l  (IG ix\u00b2.1186); the  individual  and  external  use  is  found  in  a  Delphic  proxe- ny decree of  c. 425\u00ad375  (F.Delphes iii.1422.3\u00ad4)  and  in  refer- ences  to  citizens  serving  as  federal  magistrates  (IG ix\u00b2.1 3.A.16,  19  (C 3)). The  city  was  situated  in  the  interior  of  Aitolia  at Velouchovo,  in  the  central  part  of  the  Mornos  valley (  ancient  Daphnos)  (Laffineur ( 1977);  SEG 28  504 (C 2/C1)).  In  C 4  Kallion/Kallipolis  became  the  urban  centre of  the  tribe  of  the  Kallieis,  who  in  C 5/C4  were  still  part  of  the large  Aitolian  tribe  of  the  Ophiones  (Thuc. 3.96.3). Kallipolis  was  founded  in  C 4m  at  the  latest,  and  was  from the  outset  laid  out  as  a  planned  city.

At  Ps.-Skylax 35  Molykreia  is  the  last  of  three  toponyms listed  after  the  heading        ,where the  term  polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense.  Molykreion  is explicitly  called  a  polis  at  Diod.  Sic. 12.60.3  (r 426)  again  in the  urban  sense. In C 6/C5  Molykreion  was  within  the  Corinthian  sphere of  influence (Gschnitzer ( 1958)  124f;  Graham  ( 1962),  ( 1983) 137ff),  but  by C 5m  it  had  passed  into  the  Athenian  sphere (Salmon  ( 1984)  266)  and  from,  probably,  C 5l  it  was  under Aitolian  influence (Benecke ( 1934)  8).  Thucydides  ( 3.102.2) describes  Molykreion  as  a  Corinthian  colony  that  had become  an  Athenian  satellite  (   \u00b5 ,      ). In  the  sources  Molykreion  is  located  at  the  spur  of  Mt. Taphiassos  (modern  Varassova)  (Strabo  10.2.4,  21)  near Cape  Rion  (Polyb. 5.94.7;Strabo 9.4.8,  10.2.21;Plut.  Mor. 162E;  Plin.  HN 9.28;  Ptol. 3.15.3;  Steph.  Byz. 545.13\u00ad14).  The phrase   `    (Thuc. 2.86.2;  cf.  Strabo. 8.2.3;  Steph.  Byz. 545.14)  indicates  that  the  cape  was  within the  territory  of  the  city,  which,  then,  must  have  been  situated at  the  cape  itself  (Oldfather  ( 1918),  ( 1933)  36),  or  a  little inland  by  modern  Velvina.  Here,  c. 4  km  from  the  coast  at modern  Helleniko,  are  the  remains  of  a  C 4  settlement (defence  circuit,  temple,  stoa  and  houses;  cf.  Woodhouse ( 1897/1973)  328;  Lerat  ( 1952)  i. 84\u00ad86;  188\u00ad89;  Bommelj\u00e9 ( 1987)  112;  cf.  Freitag  ( 2000)  58\u00ad67).  At  Cape  Rhion  was  a major  sanctuary  of  Poseidon  (Thuc. 2.84.4;  Ps.-Skylax 35; Paus. 10.11.6;  Diod.  Sic. 12.48.1;Plut.  Mor. 345C).  Molykreion was  responsible  for  the  administration  of  the  sanctuary  and the  organisation  of  the  festival  associated  with  the  sanctu- ary,  called   `  (IG iv  428.10  (C 3);  Plut.

From  Thucydides'  account it  is  reasonable  to  infer  that  Aigition  was  a  relatively  small fortified settlement.  On  its  polis  status,  see  the  exchange  of views  between  M.  H.  Hansen  and  P.  Funke  in  Funke  ( 1997) 173\u00ad76  and  Hansen  ( 2000)  200.There  is  no  other  mention  of Aigition  in  any  source.  Aigition  was  situated  some  80  stades from  the  sea  in  the  country  settled  by  the  Apodotai,  one  of the  three  major  Aitolian  tribes  (Thuc. 3.97.2;  Funke  ( 1997) 148).

The  internal  collective  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  found  abbreviated  as  on  a  C 4  coin  (infra). The  name  and  size  of  the  territory  are  unknown,  but  it must  have  included  the  plain  at  the  bay  of  Larmes  (Fossey ( 1990)  22).  Fossey  ( 1990)  35  argues  that  the  Classical  sites  at Bazar\u00e1ki,  probably  ancient  (for  which  see  Fossey ( 1990)  27\u00ad32)  and  Palaiokh\u00f3ri  (for  which  see  ibid. 33\u00ad35)  sit- uated  2.5  km  south  and  6  km  west  of  Larymna  respectively, were\"satellites\"of  Larymna;  in  that  case,  Larymna  had  a  ter- ritory  measuring  at  least  20  km \u00b2,  although  it  was  probably larger.  A Hellenistic  metric  epitaph  includes  the  expression [  ]    .../ \u00b5  (BCH 26  ( 1902)  330  no. 35c.1\u00ad2). Larymna  was  originally  a  part  of  East  Lokris  (Ps.-Skylax  60; SGDI 2593  ( 273)),but  later  it  ranked  as  Boiotian  (Paus. 9.23.7); exactly  when  the  regional  affiliation c hanged  is  unknown,  but Goldman  and  Walker  ( 1915)  420\u00ad21  assume  it  occurred  in C 4m;  however,  SGDI 2593  is  a  Delphic  grant  of  proxeny  from 273  to         \u00b5. The  pantheon  of  Larymna  is  unknown,  but  Fossey  ( 1990) 154  suggests  that  Dionysos  was  an  important  divinity  here. Larymna  is  situated  in  the  bay  of  Larmes  and  is  centred  on a  small  peninsula  with  a  harbour  on  its  south-east  (cf. Sch\u00e4fer  ( 1967)  540;  Lawrence  ( 1979)  472;  Haas  ( 1998)  101\u00ad2). An  elevation  of  a  few  metres  height  on  the  peninsula  served as  \"acropolis\"  (Sch\u00e4fer  ( 1967)  530).  Fortifications and ancient  remains  indicate  the  existence  of  the  ancient  settle- ment  on  the  peninsula  and  on  the  mainland,  but  modern constructions  impede  observation  of  the  degree  of  urbani- sation;  there  are  both  Archaic  and  Classical  sherds  at  the  site (Fossey  ( 1990)  22\u00ad24;  see  fig. 4  for  a  plan  of  the  site),  enough to  indicate  \"significant Classical period habitation\"  (Haas ( 1998)  106).  Sch\u00e4fer  ( 1967)  533  suggests  that  originally  the town  occupied  only  the  peninsula  (i.e.  slightly  more  than  1 ha).  This  peninsula  was  fortified,  and  the  remains  of  fortifi- cation  date  to  two  different  periods.  The  oldest  remains,  in \"Cyclopean\"  and  polygonal  styles,  are  possibly  late  Archaic (ibid. 542).  The  second  phase  was  in  isodomic  style  and probably  dates  to C 4  (ibid.).  It  seems  that  the  enclosed  area was  now  enlarged  to  cover  land  outside  the  peninsula  (see the  probable  line  of  the  circuit  in  Sch\u00e4fer  ( 1967)  Abb. 1  at 528, indicating  that  the  enclosed  area  grew  to  c. 6.5  ha).  The  forti- fications at Larymna w ere  all  constructed  in  local  breccia stone  (Sch\u00e4fer  ( 1967)  530\u00ad31). The  J.  Hirsch  auction  catalogue  of 15  May 1905  mentions that  the  collector  attributed  two  silver  coins  (nos. 1628\u00ad29) to Larymna;  no. 1628  is  a  hemiobol:  obv.  bearded  male;  rev. grapes;  legend: ,  which  rather  suggests  [ ](  ); but  no. 1629,  likewise  a  hemiobol:  obv.  beardless  youth;  rev. grapes,  has  the  rev.  legend ,which may possibly abbrevi- ate  the  ethnic  of  Larymna;  Oldfather  ( 1908)  470  accepts  the attribution  without  discussion  and  assigns  no. 1628  to C 4, and  no. 1629  should  be  contemporary  with  it. 384.

In 1840  the  ruins  of  Thronion  supplied  stone  material  for the  building  of  a  factory  (Pritchett  ( 1982)  152\u00ad53).According to Pritchett ( 1982)  154,  the  site  is  large  and  has  many  sherds.

It  is  impossible  to  know  how  precise  this  figure is, and  if  precise,  how  many  of  the  victims  were  of  citizen  status. In 431  the  city  was  captured  by  Athens  (no. 361)  and  had  to provide  hostages  ( \u00b5  ...    (sc.  the  peo- ple  of  Thronion)).  According  to  Diod. 12.44.1,  the  city  fell after  a  siege  ( ).In 353  Thronion  was  subject- ed  to exandrapodismos  by  the  Phokian  general  Onomarchos (  \u00b5      ,Diod. 16.33.3),  but  the  city  was  in  existence  once  again  in  C 4l  (CID ii  31.79,  32.37). The  earliest  preserved  public  enactments  are  two Hellenistic  decrees  (IG ix.1308\u00ad9);  the  earliest  recorded communal  action  is  the  giving  of  hostages  to  the  Athenians in 431  (Thuc. 2.26.2). The  pantheon  of  Thronion  is  virtually  unknown (Oldfather  ( 1936)  612  sets  out  the  meagre  evidence).  For speculations  that  the  city  was  active  as  coloniser,  see Oldfather  ( 1936)  610;  see  also  SEG 15  251  with  Paus. 5.22.3. In C 5f  Thronion  struck  silver  obols  on  the  Aiginetan standard:  obv.  bearded  male  head;  rev.  greave;  legend: (knemis)  in  incuse  square,  presumably  a  reference to  Mt.

The  toponym  is  not  found in  Archaic  or  Classical  sources,  but  Strabo  9.2.13  and 4.2  (MS ) has been emended to read   , (cf.  Plut.  Sull. 26.3\u00ad4;  Paus. 9.24.5;  Steph.  Byz. 68.5).  The  ethnic  is   (AJA 19  ( 1915)  442\u00ad44  no. 2  (C 5f)). The  earliest  sources  to  classify  Halai  as  a  polis  are  two Hellenistic  inscriptions:  AJA 19  ( 1915)  no. 3.2  ( 206/5)  and  no. 4.2  ( 208/7,  restored),  where  the  term  is  used  in  the  political sense;  however,  the  city  deserves  inclusion  in  this  Inventory as  a  type  B  since  (i)  AJA 19  ( 1915)  442\u00ad44  no. 2  (C 5f) testifies to  the  existence  of  a  board  of  three  eponymous  archontes  (cf. Sherk  ( 1990)  244);  (ii)  the  internal  collective  use  of  the  eth- nic  is  attested  in  the  same  inscription  and  sub-ethnics  are unknown  in  East  Lokris;  (iii)  the  city  had  a  cult  of  Athena Poliouchos  in  C 6s  (AJA 19  ( 1915)  439\u00ad42  no. 1);  though  the polis  element  of  this  (and  similar)  epithet(s)  may  originally have  meant  akropolis  (Cole  ( 1995)  301\u00ad5),  the  absence  of  a proper  acropolis  at  Halai  (see  infra)  indicates  that Poliouchos  should  here  be  taken  as  the  \"Possessor  of  the polis\",  not  of  the  akropolis  (Hansen  ( 1995b)  32\u00ad33). Halai  must  originally  have formed  part  of  East  Lokris,  but  in  C 3  the  city  was  part  of  Boiotia  (cf.  AJA 19  ( 1915)  no. 3); exactly  when  the  regional  affiliation c hanged  is  unknown, but  it  may  have  been  as  early  as  C 4m  (so  Goldman  and Walker  ( 1915)  420\u00ad21;  cf.  Argoud  ( 1997)  254).  The  evidence on  Halai  relates  mostly  to  the  city,  not  the  territory.  The \"acropolis\"  of  Halai  \"hardly  deserves  the  name  of  acropolis, for  at  no  point  does  it  rise  more  than  four  metres  above  the level  of  the  bay\"  (Goldman  ( 1940)  382;  cf.  Argoud  ( 1997) 255\u00ad56).  This  \"acropolis\"  was  fortified,  and  the  preserved remains  belong  to  two  main  periods  of  construction.  The earlier  fortification was built c. 600  or  slightly  earlier (Goldman  ( 1940)  430;  cf.  Fossey  ( 1990)  40)  at  the  \"founda- tion\"  of  the  site.  Constructed  in  large  rough  polygonal blocks  of  limestone,  the  wall  had  an  average  width  of 3.10  m and  had  at  least  three  circular  towers.  It  enclosed  c. 0.7  ha (calculated  on  the  basis  of  fig. 6  in  Fossey  ( 1990)).  This  ini- tial  fortification was r epaired  in  C 5  (McFadden  ( 2001)  62), and  the  second  main  period  of  construction,  dating  to c. 350\u00ad330  (Goldman  ( 1940)  396;  McFadden  ( 2001)  68)  or This  is  generally  (and  rightly)  assumed,  though  no  Archaic  or  Classical source  states  so  explicitly;  it  can,  however,  be  deduced  from  Ps.-Skylax  60,  which enumerates  the  cities  of  the  (East)  Lokrians  from  south  to  north,  beginning  with Larymna  and  ending  with  Alope;  if  Larymna  was  Lokrian,  so  must  Halai,  situat- ed  between  Larymna  and  Alope,  have  been. east  lokris  667 C 4l  (Fossey  ( 1990)  41;  McFadden  ( 2001)  62,  68)  enlarged  the enclosed  area  to  c. 0.85  ha  (Goldman  ( 1940)  388),  the  new sections  being  constructed  in  isodomic  ashlar  in  emplek- tron.  The  acropolis  was  bisected  by  a  street  running  from north-west  to  south-east  in  the  Archaic  period.  Buildings aligned  with  both  the  main  street  and  the  Archaic  fortifica- tion  wall  have  been  found,  suggesting  the  existence  of  a  sub- stantial  Archaic  community  within  the  acropolis  circuit (Coleman  ( 1992)  274\u00ad75;  cf.,  however,  AR  ( 1992\u00ad93)  49\u00ad50). No  Classical  remains  have  yet  been  found  on  the  acropolis (Coleman  ( 1992)  275).  The  surface  survey  carried  out  by  the Cornell  Halai  East  Lokris  Project  team  revealed  traces  of  a C 4  or  Hellenistic  circuit  wall  surrounding  a  lower  town  and enclosing  an  area  of  c. 12\u00ad13  ha  (Coleman  ( 1992)  268  with  fig. 2).  The  cemetery  was  situated  to  the  north  and  east  of  the acropolis,  probably  along  the  main  route  to the  site;  here more  than  280  graves  have  been  found,  with  the  earliest  dat- ing  to  C 6m  and  several  to  C 5  (Goldman  and  Walker  ( 1915) 424,  429;  cf.  also  ArchDelt  ( 1987)  B. 1  Chron. 228\u00ad31). The  epithet  [ ]~[] is found in a C6s inscription (Goldman  ( 1940)  401  AJA 19  ( 1915)  439\u00ad42  no. 1),  from  a C 6e  precinct  of  Athena  on  the  acropolis  that  included  a small  C 6e  temple.  This  sanctuary  was  completely  recon- structed  in  C 6l\u00adC5e,  and  a  new  splendidly  decorated  temple was  erected  on  a  bastion  engaging  the  western  part  of  the circuit  (Goldman  ( 1940)  452\u00ad54;cf.Wren  ( 1996)  17\u00ad59,argu- ing  that  the  temple  was  destroyed  c. 480,  possibly  by the Persians);  the  dedication  of  the  temple  is  commemorated  by AJA 19  ( 1915)  442\u00ad44  no. 2:H ~    '    (C 5f).

Size  of territory:  probably  1.  Type:  [A]  (?).  Knemis  was  the  moun- tain  range  dividing  Phokis  from  East  Lokris  (Oldfather ( 1922b)  909),  but  also  the  name  of  a  promontory  (Serv.  Aen. iii  399).  According  to  Strabo  9.4.4,  there  was  on  the  coast  of East  Lokris  a     by  the  name  of \u00b5;in Ps.-Skylax 61  we  find the following list of  Phokian  (sic) poleis: ,  \u00b5,  ',  .  Unless  we accept  the  emendation  proposed  above  ( 665),  then,  since Thronion  (no. 388)  was  in  East  Lokris  (Thuc. 2.26.2),  the Knemis  listed  here  may  be  Strabo's  Knemides,  and  unless Ps.-Skylax  has  here  included  a  promontory  in  a  list  of  poleis, which  is  not  at  all  impossible  (cf.  Flensted-Jensen  and Hansen  ( 1996)  140\u00ad42),  it  may  be  presumed  that  he  has  confused  the  name  of  the  promontory  with  the  name  of  a settlement  (so  Oldfather  ( 1922a)  908).  If  so,  he  classifies Knemides  as  a  polis.  There  is,  however,  no  evidence  to  sup- port  this  classification.

Alponos  is  described  as  a  polis  at  Hdt. 7.216.2,  but  as  a kome  at  Hdt. 7.176.5,  an  inconsistency  which  is  difficult t o explain.  Another  site  in  the  same  general  area,  Anthele  (no. 427),  is  similarly  described  both  as  a  polis  (Hdt. 7.176.2)  and a  kome  (Hdt. 7.200.2).So,if  there  is  an  explanation,  it  may  be one  that  is  peculiar  to  this  general  area,  such  as  the  modest size  of  the  settlements.  In  the  case  of  Alponos,  it  is  also  pos- sible  that  its  classification as a kome  is  a  reflection of  depend- ent  status  (cf.  Hansen  ( 1995a)  73\u00ad75),  and  it  may  be suggested  that  the  city  was  dependent  on  Opous  (no. 386), the  leading  city  of  the  East  Lokrian  \"confederacy\"(see  infra). Strangely,  though,  Steph.  Byz. 78.12\u00ad13  reports  (without source reference)  that  Alponos  was  \u00b5 . The  city  served  as  a  base  for  the  Greeks  during  the Thermopylai  campaign  (Hdt. 7.176.5,  229.1). Alponos  is  poorly  attested:  there  is  no  evidence  about  its territory,  and  only  a  little  about  the  city.  According  to Demetrios  of  Kallatis  (FGrHist 85)fr.  6,  as  reported  by Strabo  1.3.20,  Alponos  suffered  seriously  from  the  earth- quake  of 426  (Fossey  ( 1990)  183\u00ad84).  The  fragment,  more- over,  refers  to a  pyrgos,  which  was  one  of  several  such constructions  at  the  harbour  of  Alponos  ( \u00b5).  The  reference  may  indicate  that  the  city  was walled  (Pritchett  ( 1982)  160).  In  C 5  Alponos  was  probably centred  on  a  walled  acropolis  to  the  east  of  Thermopylai  (for which  see  Pritchett  ( 1982)  160\u00ad61  and  ( 1992)  148\u00ad50),but  the city  was  possibly  relocated  uphill  to  a  new  site  after  the earthquake  of 426  (Pritchett  ( 1982)  164;  but  see  Buckler ( 1989)  93\u00ad94);  Pritchett  ( 1982)  164\u00ad66  describes  the  proba- ble  new  site  as  a  walled  city.

Evidence  confirming this Opountian predominance is found  in  an  inscription  from  Thermopylai  quoted  by  Strabo 9.4.2  in  which  Opous  is  called  \u00b5 ;  the  epi- gram  commemorates  warriors  who  died   `  ,  and  so  probably  dates  to C 5  (see  further Lorenz  ( 1976)  no. 9  and  Molyneux  ( 1992)  182\u00ad83);  Pindar, too,  in  Ol. 9.20  calls  Opous  ... \u00b5,and the frag- ments  of  the  Aristotelian  '   likewise point  to  Opountian  predominance  within  Lokris;  thus,  frr. 561\u00ad62,  Rose,  relate  myths  about  how  West  Lokrian  cities were  founded  from  Opous.  Furthermore,  CIG ii  789 ( 312\u00ad280)  closely  associates  Opous  and  the  Lokrians  as  if there  was  no  difference  between  these  two  entities,  and finally,  as  pointed  out  supra,all C 4  hieromnemones  from  East Lokris  came  from  Opous.  See  also  infra  on  coins.  It  was  cer- tainly  this  predominance  that  gave rise  to the  literary expression  Lokroi  hoi  Opountioi  (Nielsen  ( 2000)  102). At Ol. 9.15  Pindar  describes  Opous  as  the  possession  of \u00b5      ... \u00b5 \u00b5 (Gerber  ( 2002)  28),  thus  pointing  to  an  oligarchic  or  aristo- cratic  constitution  in  Opous;  it  is  also  possible  that  Aristotle at  Pol. 1287a5\u00ad8  refers  to  Opous  as  an  example  of  aristokratia; Aristotle  here  points  out  that       ,  and  gives  Opous  as  an  example  of  this;  he adds,  however,  that  at  Opous  this  was    \u00b5 \"to  a  certain  smaller  extent\"  (Newman  ad  loc.). Another  official is mentioned b y  Plutarch:  Quaest.  Graecae 293b11  mentions  a  among  the  Opountians; there  is  no  indication  of  the  date,  but  the  passage  may  rely  on Aristotle's  '   or  Philippos  of  Opous' (C 4)    '  (RE  xix. 2354\u00ad55; Giesen  ( 1901)  465\u00ad66  and  Lasserre  ( 1987)  600.) Envoys  of  the  city  are  mentioned  in  IG ii\u00b2  572.9  (C 4l)  (an honorary  decree  for  [ ]).  SEG 23  415  ( 450\u00ad425)  is  a 670 nielsen grant  of  proxeny  by Thessalian  Pherai  (no. 414)  to a  citizen of  Opous;  SEG 23  420  is  one  of  C 4.  The  earliest  surviving enactment  of  the  city  itself  (i.e.  apart  from  ML  20)  is  IG ix.1 268  (Hell.),  a  grant  of  proxeny  that  refers  to an  eponymous archon  and  possibly  to  the  assembly  and  council. CEG ii  651  (C 4?)  refers  to the  ;  for  the  poor remains  of  what  is  probably  the  acropolis,  see  Fossey  ( 1990) 68\u00ad70.  According  to  Diod. 19.78.5,  Opous  was  subjected  to a poliorkia  in 313.  The  existence  of  an  extensive  C 4l\u00adC3  fortifi- cation  wall  is  now  securely  established  (Dakoronia  ( 1993) 120  with  fig. 4  at 122).  There  are  Archaic  and  Classical  sherds at  Opous  (Fossey  ( 1990)  70).  Inside  the  wall,  remains  of Classical  buildings  have  been  found,  enough  to  establish that  the  site  was  \"a  great  city\"  (Dakoronia  ( 1993)  120).  For two  kilns  that  seem  to  have  been  producing  in  C 4l,  see Lambropoulou  ( 1983).  According  to  Demetrios  of  Kallatis (FGrHist 85)fr.  6  apud  Strabo  1.3.20,  Opous  suffered  seri- ously  from  the  earthquake  of 426  (Fossey  ( 1990)  183\u00ad84). The  city  received  grain  from  Kyrene  in  330\u00ad326  (Tod 196.26). On  a  C 4  (IG ix.1280)  statue  base,  Dionysos  and  Apollo are  mentioned,  and  presumably  they  were  honoured  by  the dedication.  Opous  seems  to  have  celebrated  Aianteia;  cf. Pind.  Ol. 9  with  scholia. Promanteia  is  granted  to  a  man  of  Opous  by  F.Delphes iii.1 92  ( 318\u00ad306).  An  Opountian  won  the  Olympic  pankration contest  in  536  (Moretti  no. 119);      '  won  the  stadion  race  in 500  (Dion.  Hal.  AR 5.50.1);  and  Pind.  Ol. 9  was  composed  for  Epharmostos  of Opous,  who  won  the  Olympic  wrestling  contest  in  468 (FGrHist 415  fr. 1.38)  and  in  addition  achieved  victories  in  the three  other  Panhellenic  games  (Pythian:  Ol. 9.12,17;Isthmian: Ol. 9.84\u00ad86;  Nemean:  Ol. 9.87;  with  Gerber  ( 2002)  ad  locc. citt.)  as  well  as  in  numerous  other  games  (Pind.  Ol. 9.88ff  lists victories  at  Argos,  Athens,  Mt.  Lykaion  and  Pellene).  Also  in 468,  Menalkes  of  Opous  was  victorious  at  Olympia  in  boxing (FGrHist 415  fr. 1.39).According  to  the  schol. 123c  Pind.  Ol. 9., the  Isthmionikian  (Pind.  Ol. 9.84)  athlete  Lampromachos was  also  proxenos  of  Thebes  (no. 221)  at  Opous  in  C 5f  (Gerber ( 2002)  57\u00ad58  with  refs.).  Plut.  De Pyth.  or. 401f5ff  mentions  a C 4  dedication  at  Delphi  by  the  Opountians. Opous  struck  coins  from  C 5  onwards.  From  C 5  come  sil- ver  trihemiobols  and  obols  on  the  Aiginetan  standard:  obv. amphora;  rev. in  incuse  square  (Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 3  nos. 423\u00ad44).  C 4  silver  coins  (obv.  amphora  with  grapes, ;  rev.  star;  Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 3  nos. 436,  436  bis)  are similar  and  confirm that the C 5  coins  belong  to  Opous.  It  is interesting  that  coins  of  the  same  appearance  are  struck,  in the  name  not  of  the  Opountians,  but  of  the  Lokrians;  thus  a coin  of,  probably,  C 5  has  the  amphora  on  the  obv.,  and () in a border of  dots  on  the  rev.  (Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 3 no. 425).  The  legend  confirms the impression that there was no  real  difference  between  the  two  entities  of  \"Opous\"  and \"the  Lokrians\".  Similarly,  the  C 4  coins  inscribed   (supra)  have  close  parallels  in  later  coins  inscribed  or (Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 3  nos. 442\u00ad43).One  coin  even  has the  legend  on  the  obv.  and () on the rev. (Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 3  no. 435).  In  C 4  Opous  struck  a  well- known  series  of  silver  coins:  obv.  head  of  Demeter  r.  or  l.;  rev. Lokrian  Aias  in  fighting attitude;  legend:  (Head,  HN \u00b2  336  fig. 190).  These  coins,  again,  are  paralleled later  in  C 4  by  coins  inscribed  (Babelon,  Trait\u00e9 ii. 3  no. 451),  or   (\u00b5) (Babelon, Trait\u00e9  ii. 3  nos. 438,  439\u00ad41),  again  suggesting  that  \"Opous\", \"the  Lokrians\"  and  \"the  Hypoknemidian  Lokrians\"  were more  or  less  the  same  thing.  A  C 4s  issue  of  bronze  coins  have obv.  Athena;  rev.  grapes;  legend: or (Head,  HN \u00b2  336\u00ad37;Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 3  nos. 362\u00ad78;  SNG  Cop.  Aetolia-Euboea 42\u00ad58). The  foundation  myth  of  Opous  is  reinterpreted  by  Pindar in  Ol. 9  (for  which  see  the  Introduction  in  the  translation  by Nisetich  ( 1980)  122\u00ad23). 387.

Kynos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Hecat.  fr. 131 (for  which  see  Hansen  ( 1997)  17,  23\u00ad24)  and  by  Ps.-Skylax 60,  where,  reading ,  '  for  MS  , Kynos  then  appears  as  the  second  of  four  toponyms  listed between  the  heading     and  the  addendum         . Kynos  is  poorly  documented,  and  its  location  is  debated. According  to  Fossey  ( 1990)  81,  the  focus  of  ancient  Kynos was  the  Pyrgos  hill  2  km  north  of  modern  Livanates  (and  the city  may  have  included  the  sites  at  Arkitsa  and  Villovo;  cf. Fossey  ( 1990)  85\u00ad90).  The  Pyrgos  hill-top  measures  200 70  m  and  is  crowned  by  a  Hellenistic  fortification wall;  a  har- bour  lies  just  north  of  Pyrgos  and  may  have included  a  tem- ple  (Fossey  ( 1990)  81\u00ad83).  Hope  Simpson  and  Lazenby ( 1970)  47  reported  Archaic  and  Classical  sherds  from  the Pyrgos  area.  However,  Dakoronia  ( 1993)  125\u00ad26  suggests that  Pyrgos  was  simply  the  harbour  site  of  Kynos,  while  the city  proper  was  at  Palaiokastro, 2.5  km  south-east  of  Pyrgos: here  are  \"many  rich  graves  of  the  Classical  period\"  and  an extensive  and  fortified acropolis which was the c entre  \"of  a large  and  important  town\".  According  to  Demetrios  of Kallatis  (FGrHist 85)  fr. 6  apud  Strabo  1.3.20,  Kynos  suffered seriously  from  the  earthquake  of 426  (Fossey  ( 1990)  183\u00ad84). Late  sources  such  as  Strabo  9.4.2  and  Paus. 10.1.2  describe Kynos  as  merely  the  harbour  of  Opous  (no. 386),  but Oldfather  ( 1925)  32  believes  that  Kynos  was  originally  more than  that.

Naryka  is  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  IG ix.1\u00b2  3 706A.1  (C 3f),  and  in  the  urban  sense  at  Diod. 16.38.5  (r 352); Lycoph.  Alex. 1148  refers  to    .

The  name  of  the  territory  is  unknown,  but  Diod. 14.82.8 ( ...    (r 395))  may  sug- gest  that  the  toponym  could  designate  the  territory. According  to  Pritchett  ( 1985)  168\u00ad69,Naryka  was  an  extensive and  thriving  city  in  C 4;  he  notes  that  the  acropolis  \"is  covered with  blocks  and  sherds\",  and  furthermore  mentions  a  possi- ble  theatre.  In  352  the  city  was  besieged  (Diod. 16.38.5)  and must  thus  have  been  walled;  a  fortification on the acropolis is briefly mentioned in P ritchett  ( 1985)  168\u00ad69.In 352  the  city was  destroyed  by  the  Phokian  Phayllos  (Diod. 16.38.5:         ); however,  the  city  emerges  again  in  C 3fin  IG ix.1\u00b2  3  706A.  This document  is  the  earliest  surviving  public  enactment  of  the city:  it  is  a  law  of  Naryka  and  the  Aianteioi  laying  down regu- lations  concerning  the  Lokrian  Maiden  Tribute  which  went to  Ilion  to atone  for  Lokrian  Aias'  outrage  of  Kassandra  (see e.g.  Hughes  ( 1991)  166\u00ad84);  Naryka  was  presumably  involved because  this  city  was  considered  the  hometown  of  Lokrian Aias  (Diod. 14.82.8;Strabo 9.4.4;  cf.,  however,  Eur.

Kardia  is  called  a  polis  in  both  the political  and  the  urban  senses  at  Dem. 8.64  and 9.35.  For  the political  sense,  see  also  Dem. 23.181\u00ad82.  For  the  urban  sense, see  also  Hdt. 6.33.3,  36.2,  41.1,  7.58.2,  9.115.1.  In  Ps.-Skylax  67, where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense, is  the  first of eleven  toponyms  listed  after  the  heading  ... . The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on C 4s  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  Hegesippos'  speech  about the  Chersonesos  (Dem. 7.41\u00ad44).  The  individual  and  exter- nal  use  is  found  in  an  Epidaurian  proxeny  decree  (IG iv\u00b2 49.4  (C 4l))  and  in  an  Attic  funerary  inscription  (IG ii\u00b2  8961 (C 4)). Kardia  was  situated  at  the  southern  end  of  the  Gulf  of Melas  (Ps.-Skylax  67;Strabo 7  fr. 51;  cf.  Plin.  HN 4.48),on  the western  coast  of  the  isthmus  of  the  Chersonesos,  at  the  west- ern  end  of  the  Long  Wall,  at  a  distance  of 40  stadia  from Paktye  (no. 671)  at  the  other  end  (Strabo  7  fr. 53).  Kardia  is considered  to  be  the  first polis  of  the  Thracian  Chersonesos (Ps.-Skymnos  698\u00ad99;Strabo 7  fr. 51;  cf.  Dem. 5.25)  at  a  dis- tance  of 420  stadia  from  the  southernmost  tip  at  Elaious (no. 663)  (Hdt. 6.36.2)  or  400  stadia  according  to Ps.-Skylax 67.  It  is  tentatively  located  at  Cape  Bakla  Burnu,  west  of Baklar  Liman  (cf.  Kahrstedt  ( 1954)  13\u00ad14;  Isaac  ( 1986)  188 with  n. 162). Kardia  was  founded  by  Milesians  (no. 854)  and Klazomenians  (no. 847),  and  refounded  in  C 6m  by Athenians  under  Miltiades  the  Elder  (Ps.-Skymnos  700\u00ad3; cf.  Strabo  7  fr. 51).  The  name  of  its  ktistes  was  either Hermochares  (Steph.  Byz. 358.3\u00ad4)  or  Hermokrates  of Miletos  (schol.  Dem. 5.25  no. 38,  Dilts).  An  anecdote  told  by Charon  of  Lampsakos  (FGrHist 262)  fr. 1  indicates  that  the Kardians  were  defeated  by  the  Bisaltians  in  a  battle  fought in,  probably,  C 6.  Kobrys  and  probably  also  Kypasis,  emporia on  the  adjacent  coast  south  of  the  estuary  of  the  river  Melas, are  said  to  have  belonged  to  the  Kardianoi  (Ps.-Skylax  67). Holding  a  key  location  for  the  Chersonesos  (Dem. 23.182), Kardia  was  used  by  Miltiades  II  as  a  port  of  his  capital  in Chersonesos/Agora  (Hdt. 6.41.1),and  is  said  to  have  escaped occupation  by  the  Phoenician  fleet in the I onian  Revolt (Hdt. 6.33.1).  Kardia's absence  from  the  Athenian  tribute lists  is  usually  explained  by  assuming  that,  together  with other  unnamed  neighbouring  cities,  it  is  included  among the ,  later  the     '    (Kahrstedt  ( 1954)  18;  Isaac  ( 1986)  188).  In  the  troubled  period  following  the  defeat  of  Athens,  Kardia  fell  under Thracian  rule  and  became  an  operational  base ( \u00b5) for Charidemos under Kotys and his succes- sors.  Charidemos  and  the  Kardians  murdered  the  pretender Miltokythes,  who  was  allied  with  Athens  (Dem. 23.169,  175), and  the  city  was  explicitly  excluded  from  all  treaties  between the  Athenians  and  the  Thracian  kings  (Dem. 23.181\u00ad82;  cf. Diod. 16.34.4  for  the  treaty  of 353/2). After  the  eclipse  of  the  Thracian  kingdom,  Kardia  refused to  admit  Athenian  klerouchs  (Dem. 8  hypoth. 2;Diod.16.34.4) and  became  allied  with  Philip  II  (Dem. 12.11),  probably  as early  as  352  (Hammond  and  Griffith ( 1979)  380\u00ad81).  He pro- tected  the  city  against  attacks  from  the  Athenian  klerouchs  and  offered,  in  vain,  the  Athenians  to  settle  the  dis- pute  by  arbitration  (Dem. 7.41\u00ad44).  The  Athenians  refused, whereupon  Philip  sent  a  force  to Kardia  (Dem. 8.58,  64, hypoth. 2,  12.11).  The  Kardianoi  are  believed  to  have  participated  in  338/7  in  the  League  of  Corinth  (city-ethnic tentatively  restored  in  IG ii\u00b2  236b7  by  Kahrstedt  ( 1954)  37\u00ad38). During  the  reign  of  Alexander,  Kardia  was  ruled  by  a  tyrant, Hekataios  (Plut.  Eum. 3.6),  and  in  C 4l ` ` ,  presumably  the  son  of  the  tyrant, was  proclaimed  proxenos  and  theorodokos  of  Asklepios  and was  granted  ateleia  and  asylia  in  Epidauros  (IG iv\u00b2.149). Kardia  is  said  to  have  a  gymnasion  in  C 4  (Plut.  Eum. 1). Kardia  struck  bronze  coins,  probably  from  350  to 309, when  the  city  seems  to  have  been  incorporated  into Lysimacheia:  obv.  head  of  Demeter  wearing  corn  wreath,  or lion,  or  lion's  head;  rev.  lion,  or  corn-grain  in  linear  square.

In Strabo 7  fr. 51,  it  is  located  west  of  Kardia  (no. 665)  and  Drabos  and east  of  Alopekonnesos.  Isaac  ( 1986)  189  states:\"in  the  tribute lists  it  appears  between  Elaious  and  Alopekonnesos\".  But  the only  attestation  of  this  sequence  is  in  IG i\u00b3  272.ii.30\u00ad34, where  all  ethnics  are  completely  restored.  Nevertheless,  fol- lowing  Isaac,  Barr.  locates  Limnai  south  of  Alopekonnesos. Limnai  was  colonised  by  Milesians  (Anaximenes (FGrHist 72)  fr. 26;  Ps.-Skymnos  705).It  was  a  member  of  the Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district  and is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.i.97)  to (IG i\u00b3  282.i.13)  a  total  of  thirteen  times,  five times c omplete- ly  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 2,000  dr.  in  447/6  (IG i\u00b3 265.i.97),reduced  to  500  dr.  in  or  before  442/1  (IG i\u00b3  270.ii.11) and  raised  to  1,000  dr.  in  the  years  433/2\u00ad429/8  (IG i\u00b3 279.ii.25).  In  430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.iii.67,  restored)  and  429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282B.i.13)  the  Limnaioi  are  recorded  (together  with  the    '   ) as having paid their tribute to the  archontes;  presumably  they  had  to contribute  to the maintenance  of  magistrates  established  in  these  two  cities, following  the  special  measures  instituted  by  the  Athenians in  the  Hellespontine  district;  cf.  Thuc. 2.24.1.  Limnai,  not mentioned  by  Ps.-Skylax,  is  believed  to  have  vanished  by  C 4. 669.Madytos  (Madytios) Map  51.  Lat. 40.10,long.  26.20. Size of  territory: 3.  Type:  A: .

The  political  sense  is  attested  in  the  Athenian  tribute lists,  where  Madytos  appears  under  the  heading  h  ( ) (IG  i\u00b3  281.iii.51).  The  C 4s  mint  is  further  evidence for  polis  status  in  the  political  sense  (infra).  The  collective form  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on  coins  (infra) and  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  271.ii.34). The  individual  and  external  use  is  attested  only  in  one  late inscription  (IGRR  I 822). Madytos  is  listed  between  Elaious  (no. 663)  and  Sestos (no. 672)  (Ps.-Skylax  67;  cf.  Ps.-Skymnos  709\u00ad10),  to  the  east of  Cape  Kynos  Sema  and  the  site  of  Hekuba's  tomb,  and  west of  Cape  Sestias  (Strabo  7  fr. 55);  together  with  Sestos  it  lay  at the  narrowest  part  of  the  Hellespont  (Ps.-Skymnos  709\u00ad10). The  Kynos  Sema  or  tomb  of  Hekuba  (Strabo  7  fr. 55)  pre- sumably  belonged  to  its  territory,  as  indicated  by  the  rep- resentation  of  a  seated  dog  on  the  reverse  of  Madytos'  coins 908 loukopoulou (infra).  The  toponym  survived  through  the  centuries  in  the modern  village  of  Ma\u00efto  (now  Eceabat),  where  several antiquities--including inscriptions--were  discovered,  con- firming the identification  (Hauvette-Besnault  ( 1880) 506\u00ad10;  Picard  and  Reinach  ( 1912)  306\u00ad12;  IGRR i822;  cf. Robert ( 1948)  38\u00ad39;  BE  ( 1972)  279;  Isaac  ( 1986)  194). Madytos  was  colonised  by  Lesbians  (Ps.-Skymnos 709\u00ad10),presumably  in  C 7  (Isaac  ( 1986)  161),and  in  any  case before  the  arrival  of  the  Athenian  colonists  under  Miltiades the  Elder  (supra 900).  Some  Madytians  are  listed  in  the Athenian  casualty  list  of  c. 465  (IG i\u00b3  1144.34\u00ad38),  indicating that  the  city  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  Madytos belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  in  the tribute  lists  from  445/4  (IG i\u00b3  267.v.3,  completely  restored) to 421/0  (IG i\u00b3  285.ii.79)  a  total  of  twelve  times,  six  times completely  restored,  paying  500  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  270.ii.12),  attested until 440/39  (IG i\u00b3  272.ii.32),  later  raised  to  2,000  dr.,  attest- ed  from  435/4  (IG i\u00b3  277.v.5).  In  430/29  Madytos  is  listed among  those  cities  in  the  Hellespontine  district  whose  trib- ute  (phoros)  of 1,920  dr.  took  the  form  of  pay  (misthos),  pre- sumably  a  contribution  to the  maintenance  of  the hellespontophylakes  (IG i\u00b3  281.iii.42\u00ad43  and 51;  cf.  Thuc. 2.24.1).  Xen.  Hell. 1.1.3  indicates  that  it  possessed  a  good  har- bour,  which  served  as  a  base  for  the  Athenian  fleet in  411  (cf. Casson  ( 1926)  212ff).  In  346/5  Madytos  joined  other  cities  of the  Chersonesos  in  awarding  Athens  a  golden  crown  (IG ii\u00b2 1443.98). Madytos  struck  bronze  coins  in  C 4s.

The only  source  in  which  Paktye  is  described  as  a  polis  is  the  late Hellenistic  Ps.-Skymnos  711,  but  in  Ps.-Skylax  67 is the  last  of  eleven  toponyms  listed  after  the  heading   ... ,  where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense.  According  to Ps.-Skymnos  711\u00ad12,  Paktye  was  founded  by  the  Athenians under  Miltiades,  i.e.  in  C 6.  Kahrstedt  ( 1954)  20  n. 47 and  Isaac  ( 1986)  196\u00ad97  suggest  that  Paktye  in  C 5\u00adC4  was  a second-order  settlement  and  a  dependency  of  the  polis  of Chersonesos/Agora  (no. 661),  a  view  which  seems  to  be  con- tradicted  by  the  only  source  we  have  (Ps.-Skylax).  It  should be  noted,  however,  that  Paktye  is  never  included  in  the Athenian  tribute  lists  and  is  not  known  to  have  minted  coins. Paktye  was  situated  on  the  Propontic  coast  of  the  isthmus of  the  Chersonesos  (Strabo  7  frr. 52  and 54),  near  the  site  of Helle's  tomb  (Hellan.  fr. 127),  at  the  eastern  end  of  the  forti- fication wall c onstructed  by  Miltiades  across  the  isthmus (Hdt. 6.36.8;Strabo 7  fr. 54;  Plin.  HN 4.48).  It  lay  east  of Krithote  (no. 667)  and  west  of  Leuke  Akte  and  the  Hieron Oros  (Ps.-Skylax  67;  Ps.-Skymnos  711\u00ad12;Strabo 7  fr. 56),at  a distance  of 40  stadia  from  Kardia  (no. 665),  which  occupied the  western  end  of  the  isthmus  (Ps.-Skylax  67).Alkibiades  is said  to  have  sought  refuge  in  Paktye  in  408  (Diod. 13.74.2; Nep.  Alc. 7.4).  Its  exact  location  remains  uncertain  (cf. Kahrstedt  ( 1954)  13\u00ad14;  Isaac  ( 1986)  197). 672. ", "Krithote": "Identifier: 668. , (Krithousios) Map  51.

The  city-ethnic  is  on C 4s  coins  (infra).  Isoc. 15.107\u00ad8  calls  Krithote  a  polis  in  both the  political  and  the  urban  senses.

The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  on C 4s  coins  (infra). Krithote  is  listed  among  the  cities  of  the  Hellespontine coast  south  of  Paktye (no. 671)  and  north  of  Kressa  (no. 666) (Ps.-Skylax  67)  or  north  of  Madytos  (Ps.-Skymnos  711)  or north  of  Kallipolis  (Strabo  7  fr. 55)  or  between  Tiristasis  and Cissa  (Plin.  HN 4.48).  According  to  Steph.  Byz. 384.18\u00ad19,it was  situated  at  a  distance  of 80  stadia  from  Kardia  (no. 665). Krithote  must  be  located  somewhere  near  modern  Gelibolu (Isaac  ( 1986)  191),  and  probably  to the  north  (Kahrstedt ( 1954)  10\u00ad11)  rather  than  to  the  south  (Barr.). Krithote  was  founded  by  the  Athenians  under  Miltiades (Ephor.  fr. 40;  Ps.-Skymnos  712;  see  Obst  ( 1932)).  Never  list- ed  independently  as  a  member  of  the  Delian  League, Krithote  was  presumably  included  among  the  Chersonesitae in  the  tribute  lists.  Occupied  by  Ariobarzanes  in  C 4e,  it  was recovered  by  the  Athenians  under  Timotheos  (Isoc. 15.108, 112).  Later  besieged  by  the  Thracians  under  Charidemos (Dem. 23.158),  it  remained,  with  Elaious  (no. 663),  an Athenian  possession.  The  mention  of  a  siege  shows  that Krithote  was  fortified. Krithote  struck  bronze  coins  from  c. 350  to 281.

The  individual  and  external form  is  found  in  a  C 4  honorary  decree  passed  by  the  kler- ouchs  in  Samos  (no. 865)  (SEG 1349  (C 4),  Samos;  IG xii.6 253.12  (c. 350)). A  city  of  the  Thracian  Chersonesos,  Elaious  is  listed between  Araplos  (no. 660)  and  Madytos  (no. 669)  by  Ps.- Skylax 67,  between  Alopekonnesos  (no. 659)  and  Sestos  (no. 672)  by  Ps.-Skymnos  707\u00ad8.  According  to  Strabo  ( 7  frr. 51 and 55),its  precise  location  was  on  a  bay  directly  east  of  Cape Mazousia  at  the  southernmost  tip  of  the  Chersonesos,  at  a distance  of 40  stadia  from  the  city  of  Sigeion  (no. 791). Strabo  gives  the  distance  from  Kardia  (no. 665)  as  just  over 400  stadia,  and  from  Sestos  as  170  stadia.  Thanks  to  archae- ological  and  epigraphic  finds,  Elaious  has  been  securely identified w ith  the  modern  village  of  Eski  Hissarlik  at  the eastern  end  of  Morto  Bay. The  archaeological  evidence  points  to  the  presence  of Greek  colonists  in  C 7l  (Isaac  ( 1986)  193).In  C 6m  Elaious  was colonised  by  Athenians  under  (Ps.-Skymnos 707\u00ad8),  in  ATL  i. 289  n. 75  emended  to  (Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  68).  According  to  Bengtson  ( 1939) 19\u00ad20,  it  is  a  legend  fabricated  to  serve  Athenian  propagan- da,  but  Elaious  was  undoubtedly  in  Athenian  hands  in  C 5e (Hdt. 6.140.1).  Elaious  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League. It belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  in the  tribute  lists  from  447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.i.100)  to  421/0  (IG i\u00b3 285.ii.81\u00ad82)  a  total  of  fourteen  times,  four  times  complete- ly  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 3,000  dr.  in  all  years  (IG i\u00b3 265.i.100).  In  430/29  and 429/8  the  Elaiousians  are  listed among  cities  of  the  Hellespontine  district  who  paid  part  of their  tribute  in  the  form  of  misthos  (IG i\u00b3  281.iii.47, 282B.i.9),  presumably  contributing  to the  maintenance  of the  hellespontophylakes  (ATL  i. 449\u00ad50;  cf.  Thuc. 2.24.1). Elaious  was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.78\u00ad79). It  is  the  only  city  of  the  Chersonesos  to have joined  the Second  Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B27).  It remained loyal  to Athens  even  under  pressure  from  Kotys  and  despite the  siege  by  Charidemos  in  360  (Dem. 23.158);  cf.  the  golden crown  awarded  in  347/6  to  the  Athenians  by  the  Elaiousian demos  (IG ii\u00b2  1443.93\u00ad95);  its  loyalty  was  recognised  and  rec- ompensed  by  the  Athenians:  in  341  the  privileges  of  the \"Chersonesitans\"  were  extended  to  the  Elaiousians,  who obtained  equal  property  rights  with  the  Athenian  klerouchs settled  in  the  Chersonesos,  probably  in  353  under  Chares and  in  343  under  Diopeithes.  On  this  occasion,  the  ambassa- dors  of  Elaious  are  presumed  to have been  awarded Athenian  citizenship,  since  they  were  invited  to  dine  (  not ) in the prytaneion  (IG ii\u00b2  228  Osborne ( 1981)  D 15).  In  C 4  a  citizen  of  Elaious  was  granted  proxenia by  Chios  (PEP  Chios 50.10). Elaious  is  known  to  have  possessed  a  safe  harbour  at  the southern  entrance  of  the  Hellespont  (Hdt. 6.140.1;  Thuc. 8.101)  and  at  the  eastern  end  of  Morto  Bay  (Picard  and Reinach  ( 1912)  314\u00ad15;  cf.  Isaac  ( 1986)  192\u00ad93).  The  sieges  of Elaious  in  411  (Thuc. 8.103.1)  and  in  360  (Dem. 23.158)  indi- cate  that  the  town  was  fortified in the Classical period.  The tomb  and  sanctuary  of  Protesilaos  were  situated  in  the immediate  vicinity  of  the  city  (Hdt. 7.33,  9.116;  Thuc. 8.102; Arr.  An. 1.11.5;  Plin.  HN 4.11.49;  cf.  Strabo  7  fr. 51  ( 52): ).  The  Protesilaeion  was  tentatively  ident- ified w ith  a  prehistoric  mound  on  the  western  shore  of  the bay  (Casson  ( 1926)  217\u00ad18).  Excavations  of  the  cemetery  of Elaious  have  confirmed both the first  foundation  of  the  city in  C 7l  as  an  Athenian  (or  Aiolian)  colony  and  the  unam- biguous  Athenian  predominance  after  550  (Pottier  ( 1915); CRAI  ( 1915)  268ff,  ( 1916)  40ff,  ( 1921)  130ff;  cf.

Robert ( 1948)  37  (C 1))  and  internally  in  funerary  inscriptions  of  Roman  date,  discovered  at  neighbouring sites  in  the  Chersonesos,  also  with  variant  forms  such  as (cf.  Robert  ( 1948)  37\u00ad39). Alopekonnesos  was  situated  between  Limnai  (no. 668) and  Elaious  (no. 663)  (Ps.-Skymnos  705\u00ad7),  at  the  southern end  of  the  Gulf  of  Melas,  directly  north  of  Cape  Mazousia and  Elaious  (Strabo  7  fr. 51).  In Ps.-Skylax  67  it  is  listed between  the  unlocated  settlements  of  Paion  (no. 670)  and Araplos  (no. 660).  It  lay  on  a  headland  running  out  towards Imbros,  a  place  swarming  with  robbers  and  pirates  in  C 4m (Dem. 23.166\u00ad68).The  presumed  location  of  Alopekonnesos on  the  promontory  of  K\u00fc\u00e7uk  Kemikli,  at  the  north  end  of Suvla  Bay,  following  Strabo's  description,  is  archaeologically and  epigraphically  confirmed (Hauvette-Besnault ( 1880) 518\u00ad20;  Picard  and  Reinach  ( 1912)  277;  Hutton  ( 1914\u00ad16);  cf. Robert ( 1948)  37\u00ad39;  Isaac  ( 1986)  189\u00ad91). Alopekonnesos  was  founded  by  Aiolians,  and  the Alopekonnesians  were  the  first  to  colonise  Ainos  (no. 641) (Ephor.  fr. 39;  cf.  Strabo 7  fr. 52).  The  foundation  of Alopekonnesos  is  presumed  to  antedate  the  C 6  Athenian colonisation  of  the  Chersonesos.  It  was  probably  integrated into  the  Chersonesitan  state  set  up  by  Miltiades,  but  after the  flight  of  Miltiades  and  the  Persian  occupation,  it regained  its  independence  and  became  a  member  of  the Athenian  League.  Thus,  it  is  the  first  city  of  the Chersonesos  to  appear  independently  as  a  member  of  the Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from 452/1  (IG i\u00b3 261.iii.29,  mostly  restored)  to 429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.i.21  and iii.55,  almost  entirely  restored)  a  total  of  fifteen  times,  three times  completely  restored,  paying 3,240  dr.  in 450/49  (IG i\u00b3 263.v.14),  1,000  dr.  from 442/1  onwards  (IG i\u00b3  270.ii.14,a reduction  usually  attributed  to  the  establishment  of Athenian  klerouchs;  cf.  Kahrstedt  ( 1954)  16;  Isaac  ( 1986) 179\u00ad80,  190),  and  later,  from 435/4,  2,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  277.v.8).

Thuc. 2.24.1).  During  the  lengthy  conflict between  Athens  and  the  Odrysians  for  control  of  the Chersonesos  in  the  second-quarter  of  C 4,  Alopekonnesos, which  had  become  a  pirates'  nest,  was  besieged  by  the Athenians  in 360/59  (Dem. 23.166\u00ad68),  and  seems  to  have become  part  of  the  Atheno-Thracian  condominium,  rati- fied  by  the  short-lived  treaty  of 357  (IG ii\u00b2  126;  cf.  Kahrstedt ( 1954)  27;  contested  by  Veligianni  ( 1995)  161\u00ad68).  Ten  years later  Alopekonnesos  joined  the  demos  of  Chersonesos  (no. 661)  and  of  Madytos  (no. 669)  in  awarding  Athens  a  golden crown  (IG ii\u00b2  1443.95\u00ad97  ( 347/6)). Alopekonnesos  struck  bronze  coins  from  c. 400  to c. 200: obv.  usually  Dionysos,  or  head  of  maenad,  rarely  Apollo  or Athena;  rev.  fox,  or  kantharos,  or  bunch  of  grapes;  on  later coins,  ear  of  wheat.

Type:  A: . 904 loukopoulou The  toponym  is  either  (Hecat.  fr. 163)  or, usually, (Hdt. 7.58.2;  Ps.-Skylax 67;Dem.  7.39  with schol.  (no. 43,  Dilts);  Steph.  Byz. 20.9).  The  city-ethnic  is (Hecat.  fr. 163)  or  (IG i\u00b3 259.ii.28,  268.ii.7).  In  literary  sources,  it  is  in  most  cases impossible  to  distinguish  whether  is  a  city- ethnic  designating  the  polis  of  Agora  (no  unquestionable example)  or  a  regional  ethnic  designating  all  the  inhabitants of  the  peninsula  (cf.  e.g.  Hdt. 6.39:    ...    ).  Agora  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban sense  by  Ps.-Skylax  67  and  in  the  territorial  sense  by  Hdt. 7.58.2  (see  Hansen  ( 1996)  37).  The  political  sense  is  implicit- ly  attested  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists,  where  the Chersonesitai  ap'  Agoras  are  once  recorded  under  the  head- ing  h(IGi\u00b3282.Bi.11\u00ad14).That it was a polisin the political  sense  as  well  is  indicated  by  its  membership  of  the Delian  League  (infra).  The  collective  and  external  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (supra). The  individual  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic is  attested  in  Attic  funerary  inscriptions  (IG i\u00b3  1301  (C 5m);  IG ii\u00b2  10505  (C 4m)),  but  in  both  cases  it  is impossible  to  decide  whether  the  reference  is  to  the  Taurian or  the  Thracian  Chersonesos. Chersonesos/Agora  was  situated  between  Paktye  (no. 671)  and  Kardia  (no. 665)  (Ps.-Skylax  67)  in  the  middle  of  the isthmus  of  the  Chersonesos  peninsula,  presumably  on  the line  of  the  fortification wall c onstructed  for  defensive  rea- sons  by  Miltiades  (Hdt. 6.36.2).  It  is  usually  identified w ith Hellenistic  Lysimacheia  (Strabo  7  frr. 51  and 53),  and  is  ten- tatively  located  at  Bulair  (ATL  i. 564\u00ad65). Chersonesos/Agora  was  presumably  settled  with Athenian  colonists  by  Miltiades  the  Elder,  honoured  by  law (  \u00b5) as oikistes  with  sacrifices and athletic games (Hdt. 6.38.1;  see  Isaac  ( 1986)  166\u00ad67).  It  is  believed  to  have been  his  capital  (ATL  i. 563),  with  the  appellation  Agora reflecting the function of  the  settlement  as  a  market-place-- indeed,  the  major  trading  centre  with  the  Thracian  tribes  of the  adjacent  hinterland--situated on the limes  of  the Chersonesitan  state,  i.e.  along  the  Long  Wall  constructed across  the  neck  of  the  peninsula  of  the  Chersonesos (Kahrstedt  ( 1954)  7;  in  n. 10  he  interprets  in  Steph.  Byz. 20.10  as  signifying  \"Agora  by the  Wall of Miltiades\").  Undoubtedly  Chersonesos/Agora  received fresh  colonists  both  in  C 5m,  under  Perikles,  and  in  C 4f, under  Derkylidas  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.5  ( 398)),  Chares  (Diod. 16.34.3\u00ad4  ( 353/2))  and  Diopeithes  (Dem. 8  hypoth.( 343/2)). In 347/6  a  golden  crown  was  awarded  to  Athens  by  the  demos in  Chersonesos  (IG ii\u00b2  1493.97,  partly  restored). If  Chersonesos/Agora  was  indeed  the  centre of  Miltiades' Chersonesitan  state,  we  should  assume  that  it  housed  the prytaneion  mentioned  by  Hdt. 6.38.2.  It  is  generally  believed that  the  entry  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists refers  to the  polis  Chersonesos/Agora,  presumably  rep- resenting  the  remains  of  the  old  Chersonesitan  state.  The Chersonesitai  belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district  and  are recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.ii.28)  to 418/17  (IG i\u00b3  287.ii.27)  a  total  of  seventeen  times,  twice  com- pletely  restored.  They  are  first r ecorded  as   (IG i\u00b3  268.ii.7)  but  from,  probably, 441/0  (IG i\u00b3  271.i.34\u00ad35) mostly  as     '   (IG i\u00b3  277.v.9\u00ad10). Chersonesos  was  regularly  assessed  at  18  tal.  from  454/3  to 452/1  (IG i\u00b3  261.ii.31),  but  13  tal, 4,840  dr.  in  450/49  (IG i\u00b3 263.v.12).  Their  contribution  appears  drastically  reduced  to 1  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  270.ii.13),  perhaps  after  447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.i.91, amount  not  preserved)  following  the  establishment  of 1,000 Athenian  colonists  under  Perikles  (ATL  i. 563\u00ad64;  Kahrstedt ( 1954)  15).  Chersonesos  was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.73\u00ad74). Apart  from  the  coins  struck  in  C 6\u00adC5  when Chersonesos/Agora  was  the  capital  of  Miltiades'  state  (supra 901),the  Chersonesitai  struck  coins  (silver  and  bronze)  from c. 350  onwards  (Kraay ( 1976)  158;  SNG  Cop.  Suppl. 99).  ( 1) Half-sigloi  in  silver:  obv.  bounding  lion  with  head  reverted; rev.  a  variety  of  types  in  quadripartite  incuse  square  (olive leaf,  dolphin,  lizard,  etc.).  ( 2)  Small  denominations  in bronze:  obv.  lion's  head,  or  head  of  Athena;  rev.  barley-corn; legend: or (Head,  HN \u00b2257;  SNG.  Cop. Thrace 824\u00ad49,  Suppl. 99).  These  coins  are  often  taken  to  be federal  (Head,  HN \u00b2258;  Kahrstedt  ( 1954)  40;see supra 902), but  they  are  apparently  contemporary  with  the  silver  half- sigloi  and  with  the  C 4s  coins  of  Elaious  (no. 663),  Krithote (no. 667)  and  Madytos  (no. 669),  and  are  better  interpreted as  a  polis coinage  struck  by Agora/Chersonesos  (M.

Furthermore,  after  the  heading   ,the Sestians are recorded  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  as  members  of  the Delian  League  (IG i\u00b3  282B.i.20),  and  Sestos  is  recorded  in Ps.-Skylax's  list  of  cities  on  the  Chersonesos  ( 67).  The  col- lective  form  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on Hellenistic  coins  ( ,  SNG  Cop.

Sestos  lay  at  the  narrowest  part  of  the  Hellespont,  oppo- site  Abydos  (no. 765),  east  of  Cape  Sestias  where  the  bridge constructed  by  Xerxes  touched  the  coast  of  Europe  (Hdt. 7.33\u00ad34;  Thuc. 8.62.3;Xen.

It  is  probably  to  be  located  near  Yalova,  in  the  little bay  of  Ak-Bachi,  on  the  dominating  hill  of  the  Teke  of Ak-Bachi  (Isaac  ( 1986)  195,  mentioning  only  a  mediaeval castle  and  monastery). Sestos  was  colonised  by  Lesbians  (Ps.-Skymnos 709\u00ad10; Eustath.  in  Dionys.  Per. 513  GGM ii.314.43,  quoting  the lost  part  of  Strabo 7),  presumably  in  C 7  (Isaac  ( 1986)  161), thracian  chersonesos  909 and  in  any  case  before  the  arrival  of  Athenian  colonists  in C 6  (supra 900).  Sestos  was  conquered  by  the  Persians  along- side  all  the  other  cities  that  were  part  of  Miltiades' Chersonesitan  state  (Hdt. 6.33,  39),  and  governed  by Artayktes  (Hdt. 7.33,  78,  9.116\u00ad22).  The  city  was  besieged and  captured  by  the  Athenians  in 479/8  (Hdt. 9.114\u00ad19; Thuc. 1.89.2;Diod.  11.37.4\u00ad5).  Sestos  was  a  member  of  the Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district  and is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from 446/5  (IG i\u00b3  266.v.24)to 421/0  (IG i\u00b3  285.ii.74)  a  total  of  thirteen  times,  five  times completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 500  dr.  (IG i\u00b3 270.ii.10)  until 435/4,  when  it  was  raised  to 1,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3 277.v.7).  In 429/8  Sestos  is  listed  (with  Alopekonnesos  (no. 659))  among  poleis  which ~  \u00b5  (present a  voucher  for  tribute),  presumably  contributing  to  the maintenance  of  the  hellespontophylakes  and  serving  as  bases for  the  fleet  patrolling  the  Hellespontine  waters  (IG i\u00b3 282B.i.20;  cf.  Thuc. 2.24.1;  Bradeen  and  McGregor  ( 1973) 3\u00ad23).  Thanks  to  its  strategic  location  for  seafaring  and  the excellence  of  its  harbour,  Sestos  served  as  a  main  base  and strong  point  (phrourion)  for  the  Athenian  fleet  in 411  (Thuc. 8.62.2, ;  cf. 102.1,  104.1,  107.1;Xen.  Hell. 2.1.25,  4.8.5; Pol. 16.29;Strabo  13.1.22;Procop.  Aed. 4.10,  5.1.8).  After  the battle  at  Aigos  potamoi  in 405,  it  was  occupied  by  Lysandros (Diod. 13.106.8),  who  expelled  the  Sestians  and  gave  the  city and  its  territory  to  his  officers;  the  Lakedaimonians,  how- ever,  soon  decreed  that  the  Sestians  should  be  restored  to their  country  (Plut.  Lys. 14.3).  Liberated  from  the  Lake- daimonians  by  Konon  in 393  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.3,  5,  6),  the  city fell  under  the  rule  of  Ariobarzanes  who,  assisted  by Agesilaos  and  Timotheos,  averted  its  occupation  by  Kotys  in 365  (Xen.  Ages. 2.26;Isoc.  15.108,  112)  and  presumably  gave  it to  Timotheos  together  with  Krithote  (no. 667)(Nep.  Tim. 11.3).  Sestos  was  eventually  occupied  by  Kotys  with  support from  Abydos  ( 360).  In 353  the  city  was  seized  and  exposed  to andrapodismos  by  the  Athenian  general  Chares:  the  adult population  was  killed,  the  rest  enslaved  (Diod. 16.34.3),  and new  colonists  (klerouchs)  were  settled  by  Chares  in 353/2 (Diod. 16.34.4;  IG ii\u00b2  1613.297).  An  Athenian(?)  archon  in Sestos  is  mentioned  in  an  Athenian  decree  of  the  same  peri- od  (IG ii\u00b2  274;  cf.  the  archontes  in  Chersonesos  in  IG ii\u00b2  275 (before 336/5)).  In 355/4,  the  year  before  the  andrapodismos, a  citizen  of  Sestos  was  granted  proxenia  by  Athens  (IG ii\u00b2 133). Information  about  political  institutions  and  public  archi- tecture  is  amply  attested  in  inscriptions  of  Hellenistic  and Roman  date,  especially  in  the  famous  honorary  decree  for the  gymnasiarchos  Menas  (I.Sestos 1  (C 2)). Hdt. 9.115  describes  Sestos  as  the  strongest  fortress  (tei- chos)  of  the  region,  and  according  to  Theopomp.  fr. 390  it was  small  but  strongly  fortified and was c onnected  with  its harbour  by long  walls, 2  plethra  ( 61  m)  apart  (cf.  Xen.  Hell. 4,8.5;  Ages. 2.26).  The  C 4m  Athenian  rhetor  Peitholaos called  Sestos  \"the  Baker's  board  of  the  Peiraeus\"  (Arist.  Rh. 1411a14\u00ad15),  undoubtedly  referring  to  its  importance  for  the Athenian  import  of  grain  from  the  Pontic  region. Sestos  did  not  begin  to  strike  coins  until  c. 300  (Head,  HN \u00b2 260\u00ad61;  cf.

Rheneia  is  listed  among  the  Kyklades  in  Ps.-Skylax  58,but Strabo  does  not  mention  it  in  his  list  ( 10.5.3).In  C 6s  Rheneia was  conquered  by  Polykrates  of  Samos,  who  dedicated  the island  to  Apollo  (Thuc. 1.13.6,  3.104.2).  Rheneia  was  a  mem- ber  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the  Island  district and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  451/0  (IG i\u00b3  262.i.22) to 416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.14)  a  total  of  eleven  times,  three  times completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1,000  dr.  in  451/0, reduced to 300  dr.  in  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.29),  but  raised  to 500  dr.  in  or  before  416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.14).  It  was  assessed  for tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.82)  for  1,000  dr. The  preserved  fragments  of  Hypereides'  speech  entitled Deliakos  logos  (fr.  xii,  Sauppe)  testify  to  a  lawsuit  c. 344/3 (Dem. 18.134)  between  the  Rheneians  and  the  Delians  (no. 478)  over  responsibility  for  the  death  of  Aiolian  visitors  to Delos  whose  bodies  were  found  on  Rheneia.  It  appears  from the  fragments  that  Rheneia  did  not  even  possess  a  harbour (limen)  and  that  the  distance  from  the  landing-place  facing Delos  to  the  urban  centre  was  30  stadia  (fr. 74).  Much of  the southern  half  of  the  island  was  under  Delian  control, whether  as  cemeteries  for  Delos  or  as  estates  belonging  to Apollo  (see  supra 740).When  Delos  was  purified in  426/5,all remains  from  the  tombs  were removed,  presumably  to Rheneia  (Thuc. 3.104.2).  Excavations  at  the  urban  centre of Rheneia,  located  on  the  west  coast  of  the  northern  half  of  the island,  revealed  the  remains  of  an  undated  temple  of Herakles  (Charre  and  Couilloud-Le  Dinahet  ( 1999)  135  n. 3). 515.

Decrees  (psephismata)  moved  by  named  individuals  (IG xii.5  1001\u00ad4  (C 4\u00adC3e))  were  put  to  the  vote  by  prytaneis  (IG xii  suppl. 168)  or  four  proedroi  (IG xii.5  1002,  1004)  and passed  by  the  boule  and  demos  (IG xii.52,  1002,  1004)  or sometimes  just  the  demos  (IG xii.5  1001,suppl.168)  presided over  by  an  epistates  (IG xii.52,  1001).  Attested  officials are a board  of  strategoi  and  some  trierarchs  (IG xii.5  1004),  a board  of  praktores  (IG xii.5  1001),  a  board  of  eklogeis  (IG xii.5  1001\u00ad2,  1004)  and  a  board  of  hieropoioi  (IG xii.5 2  LSCG 199\u00ad200  no. 105).A  decree  of  C 4l  ( 308\u00ad306)  speaks of  the  restoration  of  the  ancestral  laws  (  \u00b5  ) (IG  xii  suppl. 168.3)).  From  C 5l  and  C 4  are  pre- served  two  laws  about  grazing  sheep  (IG xii.51,  2A  LSCG nos. 104\u00ad5).  There  is  no  real  evidence  for  civic  subdivisions (Jones,  POAG 214). Ios  bestowed  proxenia  on  citizens  of  Karystos  (no. 373) (IG xii.52A  (C 4)),Athens  (no. 361)  (IG xii.5  1000  (C 4))  and Astypalaia  (no. 476)  (IG xii.5  1003  (c. 300)).  Citizens  of  Ios were  appointed  proxenoi  by  Delos  (no. 478)  (I.D\u00e9los 76 (C 4s))  and  Pholegandros  (no. 513)  (IG xii.59  (C 4)). The  protective  deities  were  Athena  Polias  and  Zeus Polieus  (IG xii.58  (C 3s)).  The  Ietan  calendar  included  a month  named  after  Homer,  though  from  when  is  not  clear (Masouris  ( 1992));  the  poet's  mother  is  said  to  have  been from  Ios  ([Plut.]  Vit.  Hom. 4).  An  extra-mural  sanctuary  of Poseidon  Phytalmios(?)  has  been  reported  (Graindor  ( 1904) 310).  There  was  a  sanctuary  of  Apollo  Pythios,  where  public enactments  were  published  (IG xii.53  (C 5),  1000.16\u00ad17 (C 4)),  and  a  communal  cult  of  Homer,  which  probably  had a  sanctuary  or  heroon  of  some  sort  (Paus. 10.24.2;Strabo 10.5.1;  IG xii.5  * 11\u00ad*16). The  urban  centre lies  under  modern  Chora,  but  remains of  the  temple  of  Apollo  Pythios  have  been  identified ( IG xii.5  100  with  Graindor  ( 1904)  308\u00ad9,311\u00ad12).An  inscription mentions  a  place  called  Philotos  (IG xii.5  1005.4),  but  it  has  not  been  further  identified.  Remains  of  an  undated defence  circuit  are  still  visible;  it  enclosed  an  area  of  less  than 10  ha,  perhaps, 5\u00ad9  ha  (Brun  ( 1996)  149\u00ad50  and  personal information).

Arkesine  is  referred  to  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense by  the  term  at  Ps.-Skylax  58  (cf.  IG xii  suppl. 330 (C 2))  and  is  called  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  IG xii.75.4, 6,  7\u00ad8,  10,  12,  22.  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  appears internally  in  C 4  decrees  (IG xii.75.2).  Arkesine  was  situated toward  the  western  end  of  Amorgos,  and  its  territory bor- dered  on  that  of  Minoa  (no. 473).  The  size  of  the  territory was  between  25  and 100  km \u00b2. The  eponymous  official was an archon serving as c hief  of a  board  of  archons  (IG xii  suppl. 331  (C 4);  IG xii.755  Syll. \u00b3 1200  (C 4/C3);  Sherk  ( 1990)  262).  Of  other  officials the most important  is  a  strategos  (IG xii.769.47  (C 4l/C3e)).  Laws  and decrees  (IG xii.769.47  (C 4l/C3e))  were  proposed  in  accor- dance  with  a  probouleumatic  procedure  (IG xii.746  add (C 4))  and  passed  by  a  boule  and  a  demos  (IG xii.71.1  (C 5),2.1 (C 4))  presided  over  by  a  board  of  prytaneis  (IG xii.73.37, 4.6  (C 4)).  A  number  of  honorific decrees of  C 4  or  C 4l\u00ad C 3e  grant  proxenia  to  citizens  of  Athens  (no. 361),  Thera  (no. 527),  Rhithymnos  (no. 987)  and  Rhodos  (no. 1000)  (IG xii.75\u00ad11).  Public  enactments  were  stored  in  an  archive ( \u00b5)  and  in  the  sanctuary  of  Hera  (IG xii.767.83 734 reger (C 4l/C3e)).  Trials  were  brought  before  an  official called (IG xii.73.39,  42  (C 4f))  and  heard  by  a  dikasterion  situated  in  the  urban  centre  (     ) (IG  xii.73.32,  49\u00ad50).  The  protective  deity  is not  known.  The  cults  of  Athena  Itonia  were  very  important in  the  Hellenistic  period  (IG xii.722\u00ad23,  33\u00ad35),  but  in  the Classical  period  the  cult  may  have  been  that  of  Hera  (IG xii.71,  2),  in  whose  sanctuary  public  enactments  were  kept (IG xii.730.5\u00ad8  (C 3l/C2e),  67.83  (C 4l/C3e),  69.52 (C 4l/C3e));  a  public  law  forbidding  access  to foreigners  is  preserved  (IG xii.72  (C 4);  cf.  Butz  ( 1996)  86\u00ad88). The  acropolis  of  Arkesine  was  called  Aspis  (IG xii.7 57.5  (C 3)).  Four  months  of  the  calendar,  in  order,  are  known  from  C 4:  Eiraphion,  Anthesterion,  Taureion  and Thargelion  (IG xii.762.28,  9,  10,  4,  49;  Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 73\u00ad77).  The  fortification walls are probably H ellenistic (Rougemont  et al.( 1993)  104\u00ad12)  but  may  go  back  to C 4s (Brun  ( 1996)  151). 473.

The  ear- liest  explicit  attestation  of  Anaphe  as  a  polis  is  in  a  decree  of C 2  (IG xii.3248),  but  the  island's  status  as  a  polis  is  strongly indicated  by  membership  of  the  Delian  League  combined with  the  C 4  network  of  proxenoi  in  other  poleis  (infra).  The collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  C 4 lists  of  proxenoi  (IG xii.3250.15,251  passim)  and  externally  in the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (supra).  The  individual  and  exter- nal  use  is  attested  in  a  C 3m  citizenship  decree  from  Kalymna (Tit.  Cal. 41.2). Strabo  classes  Anaphe  among  the  islands  in  the  Cretan Sea  ( 10.5.1),  but  Ap.  Rhod.  Argon. 4.1711  and 1717  and  Steph. Byz. 93.10  among  the  Sporades.  The  territory  of  Anaphe  was coterminous  with  the  island.  Anaphe  was  a  member  of  the Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the  Island  district  (IG i\u00b3 287.i.9)  and  is  recorded  three  times  in  the  tribute  lists,  in 428/7  (IG i\u00b3  283.ii.31),  in  418/17  (IG i\u00b3  287.i.9)  and  in  416/15 (IG i\u00b3  289.i.9),  paying  a  phoros  of 1,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  283.ii.31).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.85)  ( 1,000  dr.).  It has  been  suggested  that  the  island  was  brought  into  the League  only  in  428/7  by  Lysikles  (Thuc. 3.19.2;  Mattingly ( 1996)  77  with  n. 27),  and  also  to  restore  Anaphe  as  a  mem- ber  of  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League  (Accame  ( 1941)  79 and 82  at  IG ii\u00b2  43.86,  but  see  Cargill  ( 1981)  35). Three  fragmentary  inscriptions  contain  lists  of  proxenoi of  Anaphe.  The  two  first are of  C 4  and  record  proxenoi  in Olynthos  (no. 588),Thessalian  Pharsalos  (no. 413),Mykonos (no. 506),  Knidos  (no. 903),  Paros  (no. 509),  Chios  (no. 840) and  Telemessos  (no. 936)  (IG xii.3250\u00ad51). The  protective  deity  was  Apollo  Asgelatas--by lapsus Agelatos  on  the  map--(IG xii.3248.8  (C 2)),  or  Aigletes (Callim.  fr. 7.19,  etc.),  whose  sanctuary  was  located  a  few kilometres  east  of  the  polis  centre and  was  connected  to the polis  centre  by  a  sacred  way  (Hiller  von  Gaertringen ( 1899\u00ad1909)  i. 352\u00ad53).  The  sanctuary  and  the  cult  are  attest- ed  in  dedications  of  the  Classical  period  (IG xii.3256  (C 4  or C 3),  257  (C 4),  258  (C 4/C3).  The  polis  centre  had  temples  of Apollo  Pythios  and  Artemis  Soteira  (IG xii.3.268\u00ad71 (Hell.));  there  was  also  a  sanctuary  for  Asklepios  (IG xii.3 248.29).  Remains  of  fortification walls and harbour are probably  Hellenistic  (Hiller  von  Gaertringen  ( 1899\u00ad1909)  i. 351\u00ad58).  For  an  updated  description  of  the  archaeological remains  and  especially  the  fortification walls,  see  Matthaiou and  Pikoulas  ( 1990\u00ad91).

The  city-ethnic  is  (Pl.  Ion 541D;  IG ii\u00b2 123.9).  Hdt. 5.31.2  classes  Andros  among  the  Kyklades;  cf. Strabo  10.5.3.Andros  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense (Xen.  Hell. 1.4.22;  Ps.-Skylax 58)  and  in  the  political  sense (Hdt. 4.33.2;  Arist.  Pol. 1270b12\u00ad13;  SEG 12  390.6,  31,  44 (c. 320);  for  the  date  see  SEG 30  1070).  The  territory,  which was  coterminous  with  the  island  itself,  is  called   by Xenophon  (Hell. 1.4.22).  The  collective use  of  the city-ethnic  appears  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists (infra)  and  on  Delos  in  377/6  (I.D\u00e9los 98.B.9\u00ad10).  Internally its  first appearance is in a decree of  C 4f(IG  xii  suppl. 245.3). The  individual  and  external  use  is  attested  in  Athens  in  C 5s (IG i\u00b3  1342\u00ad43;  Pl.  Ion 541D),  in  Epidauros  (IG iv\u00b2.1323)  and in  Delphi  in  C 5  (CID i7  Aa 6)  and  in  C 4  (CID ii  22\u00ad23). Andros  was  said  to  be  under  Naxian  control  in  494  (Hdt. 5.31.2).  Herodotos  reports  Andrians  participating  in  Xerxes' invasion  of  Greece  (Hdt. 8.66.2;  Aesch.  Pers. 887).  The  island was  besieged  by  Themistokles  after  an  unsuccessful  attempt at  extortion  (Hdt. 8.111\u00ad12).  Andros  was  a  member  of  the Delian  League,  and  may  have  been  among  the  original  mem- bers  (ATL  iii. 198\u00ad99).  It  belonged  to  the  Island  district  (IG i\u00b3 270.v.20)  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  451/0  (IG i\u00b3 262.i.19)  to  416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.21),  a  total  of  fourteen  times, twice  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of  first  12  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  262.i.19),  reduced  to  6  tal.  in  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.22),  but raised  to  7  tal.  in  416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.21).  It  was  assessed  for tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.64)  ( 15  tal.).  Plutarch (Per. 11.5) mentions  the  dispatch  of 250  Athenian  klerouchoi,  plausibly dated  to  c. 453\u00ad448  (Figueira  ( 1991)  220  with  note  W).  Naval forces,  probably  with  marines,  participated  in  actions  during the  Peloponnesian  War  (Thuc. 4.42.1,  7.57.4,  8.69.3).  In  the last  phase  of  the  war  they  fought  on  the  Spartan  side  (Diod. 13.69.4\u00ad5;Xen.  Hell. 2.1.31).  In C 4  Andros  joined  the  Second Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.16).  In  356  the  Athenians had  a  garrison  and  a  general  on  Andros  whose  position  was called  an  arche  (Aeschin. 1.107;IG  ii\u00b2  123  Tod 156);see  Reger ( 1994a)  314\u00ad15).In  the  370s  and  later  the  Andrians  participat- ed  closely  enough  with  the  Athenians  in  the  administration of  the  amphiktyony  on  Delos  to  be  punished  by  the  Delians in 314  (Tr\u00e9heux  ( 1987)  386). In 411  a  contingent  of  Andrian  soldiers  supported  the Four  Hundred  in  Athens  (Thuc. 8.69.3),  and  from  this Gehrke,  Stasis 22  infers  that  Andros  must  have  been  one  of the  poleis  in  which  the  constitution  was  changed  from  a democracy  to  an  oligarchy  after  the  oligarchic  revolution  in Athens  (cf.  Thuc. 8.64.1).  The  Athenian  decree  on  Andros  of 357/6  (IG ii\u00b2  123.9)  indicates  that  the  constitution  had changed  back  to a  democracy,  probably  in  C 4e.  The  only known  public  enactments  of  the  Classical  period  are  a  treaty with  Delphi  (no. 177)  about  theoroi  (CID i7  (C 5s))  and  a  cit- izenship  decree  of  C 4  (IG xii  suppl. 245).  We  hear  about  a boule  with  a  grammateus  and  a  board  of  tamiai  attached (CID 17;  IG xii  suppl. 245).  The  eponymous  official was an archon,  indisputably  attested  from  C 3  onwards  (IG xii.5 715),  but  probably  referred  to  already  in  the  Classical  period (CID i7A.9,  cf.  p. 22;  Sherk  ( 1990)  263).  The  Andrians  dedi- cated  at  Delphi  a  statue  of  their  oecist  Andreus  (Paus. 10.13.4; for  the  date, 412/11  or 308,  see  Jacquemin  ( 1999)  313  no .  63). Andros  bestowed  proxenia  on  a  citizen  from  an  unknown polis  (IG xii  suppl. 245  (C 4)),  and  a  citizen  of  Andros  was appointed  proxenos  by  Karthaia  (no. 492)  (IG xii.5542.b.3\u00ad7 (C 4m)).  C. 330  a  theorodokos  was  appointed  to  host  theoroi from  Argos  (no. 347)  (SEG 23  189.ii.13). The  protective  deity  was  probably  Apollo  Pythios  (IG xii suppl. 245.14),  though  explicit  testimony  from  the  Archaic and  Classical  periods  is  absent.  A  stele  recording  a  C 4  proxe- ny  decree  was  erected  in  his  sanctuary  (IG xii  suppl. 245.14). An  inscription  of  perhaps  C 4  mentions  a  cult  of  Zeus Meilichios  (IG xii.5727).  The  Andrians  dedicated  an   on  Delos  (I.D\u00e9los 104\u00ad24.36;  cf.  Tr\u00e9heux  ( 1987)  381\u00ad83).  Two Andrians  are  attested  as  victors  in  the  Olympic  Games (Olympionikai 339,  588;  Hdt. 9.33.2;  Paus. 3.11.6,  6.14.13).  An Andrian  boy  is  attested  as  victor  at  Oropos  in,  probably, 329/8  (Petrakos  ( 1997)  409\u00ad15  no. 520.19  IG vii  414; Knoepfler ( 1993)  for  the  date). The  polis  centre  was  located  on  the  south-western  coast  of the  island  at  the  unoccupied  site  called  Palaiopolis.  It  still has  magnificent walls,  which  undoubtedly  belong  to  C 4  (so Sauciuc  ( 1914)  10\u00ad16)  rather  than  to  the  Hellenistic  period (so  Tzedakis  ( 1975)  323).The  walls  are  implied  in  connection with  the  siege  in  480  (Hdt. 8.112)  and  Alkibiades'  attack  in 408  (Diod. 13.69.4).  Remains  of  the  western  wall  stretch from  the  coast  to  the  acropolis,  c. 1600  m  from  the  coast. Nothing  is  left  of  the  other  walls  but,  to  judge  from  burials, the  circuit  must  have  enclosed  an  area  of  over  100  ha (Sauciac  ( 1914)  10\u00ad16).  For  the  urban  centre,  see Palaiokrassa-Kopitsa  ( 1996).The  Pythion,  attested  in  C 4  (IG xii  suppl. 245),  is  probably  the  same  as  the  sanctuary  of Apollo  (        ) mentioned repeatedly in  Hellenistic  inscriptions  (e.g.  IG xii.5  715  8  (C 3)).A  stoa  of Classical  date  has  been  reported  (ArchEph  ( 1964)  2\u00ad4).  A rock-cut  inscription  of  perhaps  C 4e  bearing  the  words  \u00b5 736 reger    (Palaiokrassa  ( 1993)  125\u00ad26)  may  indicate  a sanctuary  dedicated  to  a  female  deity  (S\u00e8ve,  BE  ( 1995)  451). At  least  two  important  settlements  are  known  outside  the polis  centre  at  Andros,  one  to  the  east  at  Zagora (Cambitoglou  et al.( 1971),(1988)),the  other  west  at  Hypsele (Televantou  ( 1996),  ( 1999)),  both  of  which  began  in  the Geometric  period  but  continued  to  be  occupied  later. Hypsele  had  a  temple  (cf.  Reger  ( 1997)  469).  A  phrourion  at Gaurion  on  the  north-east  coast  was  fortified b y  Alkibiades in 408  (Diod. 13.69.4). In  the  Archaic  period  Andros  struck  silver  coins  on  the Aiginetan  standard.  Denominations:  stater  (didrachm), drachm  and  fractions.  Types:  obv.  amphora;  rev.  incuse square  (Paschalis  ( 1898)).  The  coinage  stopped  c. 478 (Figueira  ( 1998)  577).  Later  coins  have  been  attributed  to  C 4f (Paschalis  ( 1898)  348;  Sauciuc  ( 1914)  77;  Erxleben  ( 1970)  70), but  are  perhaps  better  seen  as  Hellenistic  (Head,  HN \u00b2482). The  Andrians  founded  colonies  at  Argilos  (no. 554), Stagiros  (no. 613),  Akanthos  (no. 559)  and  Sane  (no. 600) (Thuc. 4.84.1,  88.2,  103.3,  109.3,  5.6.1).  A  disagreement  with Chalkis  (no. 365)  over  the  distribution  of  territory in  the colony  at  Sane  led  to  arbitration  by  Erythraians  (no. 845), Samians  (no. 864)  and  Parians  (no. 509)  (Plut.  Mor. 298A\u00adB; Piccirilli  ( 1973)  7\u00ad11  no. 2). 476. ", "Mykonos": "Identifier: 508. , (Mykonios) Map 61.  Lat. 37.25;long. 25.20.  Size  of  territory: 2  ( 86  km \u00b2).  Type:  A.

Mykonos  is  attested  as  a polis  in  the  urban  sense  in  an  inscription  of  C 4\u00adC3  (Syll. \u00b3 1215.19)  and  appears  under  the  heading  polis  used  in  the political  sense  in  the  so-called  Charter  of  the  Second Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.32,  70,  78,B19)  and  in  the accounts  of  the  Delian  amphiktyones  (I.D\u00e9los 98.A11, B 3  IG ii\u00b2  1635  ( 377\u00ad373)).  Ps.-Skylax  ( 58)  calls  Mykonos dipolis.  We  do  not  know  anything  more  about  these  two poleis  except  that  they  merged  completely  in  C 3s;  it  is  likely that  they  were  always  involved  in  a  federation  or  that  one was  dependent  on  the  other  (Syll. \u00b31024.3  (c. 200):  ;  cf.  Reger  ( 2001)).  The  collective use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  abbreviated form  on  coins  of  C 4  (infra)  and  externally  in  the  Athenian tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  264.iv.8)  and  in  Archilochos  fr. 124a.  For the  individual  and  external  use,  see  the  C 4  dedication  by  a Mykonian  woman  at  Delos  (I.D\u00e9los 52). Strabo,  citing  Artemidoros,  classes  Mykonos  with  the Kyklades  ( 10.5.3).  There  seem  to  be  the  remains  of  a  sanctu- ary  at  Leno,  located  south-east  of  the  modern  town.  The locations  of  the  two  polis  centres  remain  uncertain, although  one  is  likely  to  have  been  at  Palaiokastro  and  the other  at  the  site  of  the  modern  town  (see  Reger  ( 2001) 163\u00ad67). Mykonos  was  subdued  by  Persia  during  the  reign  of Dareios  (Aesch.  Pers. 885;  Hdt. 6.118.1).  After  Xerxes'  inva- sion  of  Greece,  Mykonos  became  a  member  of  the  Delian League.  It  belonged  to  the  Island  district  and  is  recorded  in the  tribute  lists  from  452/1  (IG i\u00b3  261.ii.7)  to  416/15  (IG i\u00b3 289.i.28)  a  total  of  thirteen  times,  three  times  completely restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1\u0153  tal.  in  452/1,  reduced  to  1  tal. (IG i\u00b3  271.i.90)  in  443/2  (IG i\u00b3  269.v.23).  It  was  assessed  for tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.75)  ( 2  tal.,  restored).  Mykonos  also belonged  in  the  370s  to  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.19).In  C 4  a  citizen  of  Mykonos  received  proxenia from  Anaphe  (no. 474)  (IG xii.3251.8\u00ad11). Bronze  coins  with  the  legend  or and  obvers- es  often  bearing  the  head  of  Dionysos  are  dated  starting  C 4 by Head,  HN \u00b2  487;  see  also  Svoronos  ( 1893)),but  this  may  be too  early  (Reger  ( 2001)  178\u00ad79). 507.Naxos  (Naxios) Map  61.

Pers. 885;  Hdt. 5.28;  Ant. 1.16;  SEG 19  204.A3  (c. 375)), denoting  both  the  island  (Hdt. 5.31.2)  and  the  town  (Thuc. 1.137.2).  The  city-ethnic  is  (I.D\u00e9los 1.3  (c. 600);  IG vii 3225.1  (c. 500);  IG i\u00b3  1357.3  CEG i.58  ( 510\u00ad500);  Hdt. 8.46.3). Naxos  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Hdt. 6.96; Arist.  fr. 566,  Gigon  (rC 6))  and  in  the  political  sense  (Hdt. 5.30.1;  Thuc. 1.98.4;  SEG 12.390.6\u00ad7,  32,  44  (c. 320);  cf.  SEG 30 1070).  The  territorial  sense  is  attested  at  Hdt. 5.30.3\u00ad4.  In  the Delphic  naopoioi  accounts  the  Naxians  appear  as  contribu- tors  in  a  list  headed  by  the  formula:       (CID ii  4.i.14\u00ad16).  The  collective use  of the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on  coins  of  C 4  (infra) and  externally  in  inscriptions  (ML  27.8  ( 479);  I.D\u00e9los 98B.9 ( 377/6);  CID ii  4.i.16,  20,  21  (C 4f))  and  in  literary  sources (Archil.  fr. 89.6,  West;  Hdt. 8.4.3;  Thuc. 1.98.4;  Arist.  Pol. 1305b1).  The  individual  use  is  attested  internally  on  a  tomb- stone  of  C 4\u00adC3  (IG xii.567,but  perhaps  a  pierre  errante)  and externally  in  inscriptions  from  Delos  of  C 7  (I.D\u00e9los 2), Athens  of  C 6l  (IG i\u00b3  1357  CEG i.58),  Delphi  of  C 4f(CID  ii 4.i.20,  21,  24,  26),  and  Olympia  of  C 4s  (IvO 651)  and  in  liter- ary  sources  (Hdt. 1.61.4;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 15.2;  Oec. 1346b7: \u00b5 ).  Patris  is  found  in  Arist.  fr. 558,  Rose. Naxos  is  the  largest  Kykladic  island  (Strabo  10.5.3).  In  the Archaic  period  some  of  the  wealthy  Naxians  lived  in  the  asty 760 reger and  some  in  komai,  of  which  one  was  called   (Arist.  fr. 566).  Steph.  Byz.  claims  that  on  Naxos  there  was  a polis  named ( 479.9)  and  another  named   ( 630.8),  where  a  certain  Tragios  Apollo  was  worshipped;  he cites  Eupolis  for  the  plural  form  (PCG  fr. 487),  but it  is  not  wholly  clear  whether  the  plural  form  denotes  the polis  on  Naxos  (in  which  case  we  have  testimony  for  it  from C 5s)  or  the  homonymous  island  (less  likely).  Herbst  ( 1935) 2083  associates  this  sanctuary  with  a  horos  inscribed         (IG xii.543  (C 4\u00adC3?));  cf.  also the  remarks  of  F.  Hiller  von  Gaertringen  apud  IG xii.550). An  inscription  of  C 4  gives  the  toponyms   '  and \u00b5  ,persuasively identified with modern Melanes,so rich  in  sanctuaries  (IG xii  suppl. 194.16  with  Hiller  von Gaertringen's comm.  there, 14\u00ad15). was  a  district on  the  east  coast  (IG xii.5  test. 1415).  The  famous  Naxian marble  quarries  had  been  opened  by  C 7  and  continued  to operate  throughout  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods (Kokkorou-Aleura  ( 1992);  Brun  ( 1997)  407\u00ad8). Naxos  was  said  to  have  been  occupied  first b y  Thracians and  then  by  Karians  from  Mt.  Latmos  under  the  leadership of  Naxos,  son  of  Polemon  (Diod. 5.50.2\u00ad7,  51.1\u00ad2  and 3\u00ad4; schol.  Dionys.  Per. 525,  GGM ii  451;  Steph.  Byz. 468.7\u00ad8). Later,  Ionians  from  Athens  colonised  the  island  (Hdt. 8.46.3; Ael.  VH 8.5;  Paus. 7.3.3;  Costa  ( 1997)  51). The  Naxians  played  a  predominant  role  in  the  central Aegean  during  the  Archaic  period;  their  activities  left remains  both  in  the  decoration  of  Delos  and  in  a  continuing hostility  to  Paros  (no. 509).  The  Naxians  and  the  Parians fought  on  and  off  in  C 7f  (cf.  Kontoleon  ( 1952)  E 2  col. i  ll. 4\u00ad32  (SEG 15  517);  Lanzillotta  ( 1987)  71\u00ad88;  Berranger  ( 1992) 205\u00ad7;  Costa  ( 1997)  115\u00ad28);  at  least  once,  the  Parians imposed  a  severe  defeat  on  the  Naxians  (IG xii.5445.54:  the Parians).  In  C 6s  an  oligarchy  was  followed  by  the  tyranny  of Lygdamis  (Arist.  Pol. 1305a39\u00adb1)  after  a  major  stasis  (Arist. fr. 566).Helped  by  \"the  Naxian  man  Lygdamis\"  (Hdt. 1.61.4), Peisistratos  in  turn  installed  Lygdamis  as  tyrant  on  Naxos ( 540\u00ad524)  (Hdt. 1.61.3\u00ad4,  64.1\u00ad2;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 15.2\u00ad3;  Arist. Oec. 1346b6\u00ad12;  see  also  Ath. 348A\u00adC;  Costa  ( 1996),  ( 1997) 147\u00ad68).  Lygdamis'  tyranny  was  replaced  by  an  oligarchy  of    (Hdt. 5.30.1)--established perhaps w ith  assist- ance  of  the  Spartans  who  overthrew  him  (Plut.  Mor. 859D)--until it in turn was o verthrown  c. 500  by the  demos (E.  W.  Robinson  ( 1997)  117\u00ad18)  after  a  new  stasis  (Gehrke, Stasis 123\u00ad24);  the  oligarchs  fled t o  Miletos  (no. 854)  and contributed  to  the  outbreak  of  the  Ionian  Revolt  against  the Persians  in  494  (Hdt. 5.30).  The  so-called  list  of  thalassocra- cies  in  Eusebios  (Chronikon,p. 226,  Schoene;  M.  Miller ( 1971)  5\u00ad6,  40\u00ad41)  credits  the  Naxians  with  one  in  515\u00ad505. Naxos  was  subdued  by  Persia  during  the  reign  of  Dareios (Aesch.  Pers. 885).  In  499  the  Naxians  are  said  to  have  con- trolled  Paros  (no. 509),  Andros  (no. 475)  and  the  other Kyklades  around  it  (Hdt. 5.31.2;Paros  doubted  by  Lanzillotta ( 1987)  105\u00ad6).  Led  by  Aristagoras  and  Megabates,  the Persians  attacked  Naxos,  but  the  Naxians  learned  about their  plans  beforehand  and  prepared  for  a  siege  by  complet- ing  their  walls  and  storing  food  and  water,  and  the  operation failed  (Hdt. 5.34).  Nine  years  later  in  490  another  Persian force  successfully  took  the  island  when  the  Naxians  aban- doned  their  city  and  fled into the mountains;  the  Persians burned  the  city  and  temples  and  exposed  the  inhabitants they  captured  to  an  andrapodismos  (Hdt. 6.96;  see  Costa ( 1997)  171\u00ad80).  The  Naxian  ships  (four,  five or six) under Persian  authority  at  Salamis  defected  to  the  Greek  side  (Hdt. 8.46.3;  cf.  Aesch.  Pers. 879\u00ad887;  for  the  numbers,  Hdt. 8.46.3, four;  Hellanikos  (FGrHist iii  B 323a)  fr. 28,  six;  Ephor.  fr. 187, five,  both  cited  at  Plut.  Mor. 869A). The  Naxians  joined  the  Delian  League  in  the  summer  of 477  as  a   \u00b5\u00b5,  contributing  ships  (Thuc. 1.98.4, 99).  Naxos  belonged  to the  Island  district  and  is  recorded  in the  tribute  lists  from  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.35,  restored)  to 416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.27)  a  total  of  eleven  times,  three  times  com- pletely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 6  tal., 4,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3 264.iii.25),  raised  to  9  tal.  in  or  before  417/16  (IG i\u00b3  288.i.4).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.63)  ( 15  tal.). C. 475\u00ad470  (Rhodes  ( 1985)  12\u00ad13)  Naxos  defected  from  the League  but  was  reduced  after  a  siege  (Thuc. 1.98.4,  137.2; Polyaen.  Strat. 1.30.8).  In  453\u00ad448,  500  Athenian  klerouchs were  settled  on  Naxos  (Plut.  Per. 11.5\u00ad6;Diod.  11.88.3;  Paus. 1.27.5;  Pl.  Euthphr. 4C;  Aeschin. 2.175;  cf.  Figueira  ( 1991)  220). In C 4e  Naxos  was  allied  with  Sparta  (no. 345),  and  in  376  an Athenian  squadron  under  Chabrias  laid  siege  to  the  city  and defeated  the  Lakedaimonian  auxiliary  squadron  in  a  major sea  battle  fought  between  Naxos  and  Paros  (Diod. 15.34.3\u00ad5; SEG 19  204).  Thereafter  the  Naxians  may  have  joined  the Second  Athenian  Naval  League  in  the  370s  (I.D\u00e9los 98.B9  IG ii\u00b2  1635.119;  cf.  Dreher  ( 1995)  219 with 137\u00ad38),  but they  are  not  recorded  among  the  members  listed  in  IG ii\u00b2  43. They  struck  a  treaty  with  Athens  some  time  before  353/2  (IG ii\u00b2  179  with  Gauthier  ( 1972)  168,  331).  In  345/4  the  Naxians awarded  the  Athenian  demos  a  crown  (IG ii\u00b2  1443.114). Naxian  military  prowess  is  relatively  well  attested.  The war  with  the  Milesians  (C 6?),  recorded  in  two  different  traditions,  by Plutarch (Mor. 254B\u00adF,  probably  based  on  the  Aristotelian  Constitution  of  Naxos  (fr. 567.1))  and Parthenios,  probably  following  Andriskos  (FGrHist 500  fr. the  aegean  761 1.9),  involved  a  siege  in  which  the  Naxians  were  locked  up within  the  city  walls  and  an  expedition  against  the  besiegers by  Naxian  forces.  Polykrates  the  Samian  tyrant  borrowed troops  from  Lygdamis  to  secure  his  tyranny  (Polyaen.  Strat. 1.23.2).  The  Constitution  of  Naxos  mentioned  a  strategia  of Lygdamis  (fr. 566),  and  the  Naxians  are  said  to  have  been able  to muster  8,000  hoplites  and  \"many  big  ships\"  in  499 (Hdt. 5.30.4);  a  few  years  later  they  manned  several  triremes for  the  invasion  of  Greece  (Hdt. 8.46.3;  on  the  number,  cf. supra). The  Aristotelian  collection  of  constitutions  included  a    (fr. 566).  In  C 4l  decrees  were  passed  by the  boule  and/or  the  demos  (SEG 33  676.5\u00ad6,  10  (c. 300)). They  were  published  by  the  grammateus  of  the  boule,  and  set up  in  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo  at  the  expense  of  a  board  of tamiai  (Matthaiou  ( 1990\u00ad91)  114).  In  C 2  the  eponymous official was the priest of  Dionysos  (IG xii.5128.23  in  add. p. 308),  but  an  inscription  from  Arkesine  on  Amorgos  of 325\u00ad275  is  dated  by  a  board  of  aisymnontes  (IG xii.7 67B.36  Migeotte  ( 1984)  168\u00ad77  no. 49)).  A  court  in  Naxos ([ ]) is mentioned in the C4f  treaty  between Athens  (no. 361)  and  Naxos  (IG ii\u00b2  179.9).  Naxos  granted proxenia  to  a  citizen  of  Megaran  (no. 225)  (SEG 33  676 (c. 300)),  and  five N axians  received  proxenia  and  citizenship from  Chios  (no. 840)  (SEG 12  390.2,27,49\u00ad54  (c. 320);  cf.  SEG 30  1070). The  protective  deity  was  Dionysos  (so  the  coins,  see  infra; Diod. 3.66.1,  4.61.5,  5.52;Plut.  Thes. 20.1;Plut.  Mor. 741A), who  appears  both  without  an  epithet  (IG xii.545  (C 5\u00adC4)) and  as  Dionysos  Meilichios  and  Dionysos  Bakcheus  (Ath. 78C,  quoting  the  local  historians  Aglaosthenes  (FGrHist 499)  fr  4.and  Andriskos  (FGrHist 500)  fr. 3  (both  C 4s\u00adC3f)). Ananios,  however,  speaks  of  Apollo  who  \"has\"  ( ) Naxos  (Ananios  fr. 1.2,West;  cf.  Hymn.  Hom.  Ap. 44;  IG xii.5 42  (C 6\u00adC5),  43  (C 4\u00adC3);  and  see  the  Delion  of  C 6,  supra). We  hear  in  C 4  also  of  Athena  Poliouchos  (IG xii.541), Athena  without  an  epithet  (IG xii.540  (C 6\u00adC5))  and  a  sanc- tuary  of  the  Kabeiroi  (SEG 25  939).  Other  communal  cults include  Zeus  Melosios  (IG xii.548  (C 4);  cf.  Herbst  ( 1935) 2082\u00ad83),  Zeus  Euboulos  (IG xii  suppl. 196  (C 4),  with Matthaiou  ( 1992\u00ad98a),Zeus  Olympios  (IG xii.549  (date  not clear)),  and  Zeus  Stratios  (IG xii.550  (date  not  clear)); Demeter  and  Kore  (IG xii  suppl. 196  (C 4),  with  Matthaiou ( 1992\u00ad98a);  Demeter  Hadreus  (Lambrinoudakis  ( 1979) 252\u00ad54);  Poseidon  Helikonios  (SEG 36  761  (C 5\u00adC4);  cf.  SEG 45  1138);  the  Nymphai  Mychieis  (IG xii.553  (C 4));  and Hestia  (Plut.  Mor. 254B  (C 6)).  Only  three  Naxian  months are  attested:  Ekatombaion,  Kronion  and  Artemision  (IG xii.767B.36  Migeotte  ( 1984)  no. 49  ( 325\u00ad275);  IG xii.545 (C 4?);  IG xii.538.2  (C 1);  see  Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 72\u00ad73  and Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  119). The  town  of  Naxos  was  walled  by  C 6  (Andriskos  (FGrHist 500)  fr. 1.1;  Hdt. 5.34),in  the  470s  (Thuc. 1.98.4,137.2;Ar.Vesp. 355)  and  in  376  (Diod. 15.34.4).  (At  Aen.  Tact. 22.20 is  an  unconvincing  conjecture.)  Remains  of  an  undated  city wall  were  seen  by  Dugit  ( 1867)  35\u00ad37,  but  are  no  longer  visi- ble.  To judge  from  preserved  tombs  and  other  remains,  the walled  town  seems  to  have  covered  an  area  of 20  ha.  Traces of  occupation  from  the  Geometric  period  have  been  discov- ered  toward  the  northern  end  of  the  present  town (ArchDelt 39  Chron. 292\u00ad95  and 29  Chron. 867\u00ad70).  There  was  a  Delion just  outside  the  city  walls  in  C 6  (Andriskos  (FGrHist 500)  fr. 1.1);  for  confirmation of  the  date,  see  BCH 96  ( 1972)  772,  re Geometric  sherds  from  the  site),  which  was  probably  at  the site  of  the  temple  of  Apollo  Delios  begun  by  Lygdamis  c. 530 that  still  dominates  the  harbour  (Welter  ( 1924);  Gruben  and Koenigs  ( 1968),  ( 1970);  briefly G ruben  ( 1986)  344\u00ad47; Koenigs  ( 1972)).  A  prytaneion  and  a  theatre  (restored)  are attested  in  C 3  (IG xii.535  with  S.  G.  Miller  ( 1978)  200\u00ad1  nos . 368\u00ad69),  but  a  seat  from  the  koilon  of,  probably,  the  theatre has  been  recovered,  and  Gruben  ( 1982a)  165\u00ad66  reports  the discovery  under  the  heading  \"Archaische  Bauten\".  Pindar mentions  a  public  cult  of  Hieros  and  Ephialtas  (Pyth. 4.88;  cf. IG xii.556);  a  horos  of  Zeus  Melosios  of  C 4  (IG xii.548)  and two  of  Apollo  from  C 6e\u00adC5s  (Psarras  ( 1999))  and  C 4\u00adC3 (IG xii.542)  indicate  the  existence  of  sanctuaries.  Excavation has  recovered  a  sanctuary  dating  from  c. 570  at  Yria (Lambrinoudakis  and  Gruben  ( 1987\u00ad88);  Lambrinoudakis ( 1992);  Gruben  ( 1993)  99\u00ad105);  this  has  recently  been assigned  to  Dionysos  and  identified as the c hief  sanctuary  of the  island  (Gruben  ( 1997)  300);  the  unfinished statue at Apollona,  now  seen  as  Dionysos,  may  have  been  intended  to stand  by  this  temple  like  the  colossus  of  Apollo  on  Delos  ded- icated  by  the  Naxians  (ibid. 293\u00ad300).  There  is  an  Archaic sanctuary  for  Demeter  at  Sangri  (Kontoleon  ( 1954);  Lambri- noudakis  et al.( 1977)  382\u00ad86;  Gruben  ( 1993)  106\u00ad9),  and another  nearby  at  Gyroulos  (Ergon  ( 1977)  156\u00ad61,(1979) 24\u00ad25;  Prakt  ( 1977)  382\u00ad86),  which  may  be  dedicated  to Apollo  (SEG 31  744).A  sanctuary  of  Athena  was  located  in  the vicinity  of  modern  Sangri  (IG xii.540  (C 6\u00adC5)  with  test. 1421);  Athena  Poliouchos'  sanctuary  was  situated  north- east  of  the  town  at  Engares  (IG xii.541  with  test. 1421).  The sanctuary  of  Zeus  Melosios  was  on  the  east  side  of  Mt.  Drios (the  modern  Ozia)  (cf.  Diod. 5.51.4),  near  Philoti  (IG xii.548 with  the  map  at  IG xii.5  fasc. 2  p.  xxiii).  The  grotto  of  the Nymphai  Mychieis  lay  north-east  of  the  town  (IG xii.553). 762 reger Finally,  the  sanctuary  of  Otos  and  Ephialtas  was  at  Melanes (IG xii.556). Many  communal  dedications  of  the  Naxians  are  attested from  several  sanctuaries.  The  Naxian  Leonidas,  honoured  in Olympia  by  the  Arkadian  polis  of  Psophis  (no. 294)  (Paus. 6.16.5;  IvO 294),  dedicated  out  of  his  own  funds  a Leonideion  in  330\u00ad320  (Paus. 5.15.2;  IvO 651;  Mallwitz  ( 1972) 246\u00ad54).  On  Delos,  the  Naxians  dedicated  a  palm  (Ath. 502B with  Bruneau  ( 1990)  568\u00ad71)  and  the  famous  colossus  of Apollo  dating  to 590\u00ad580  (I.D\u00e9los 4  and 49;  Bruneau  and Ducat  ( 1983)  125\u00ad28;  Bruneau  ( 1988)  577\u00ad82;  Gruben  ( 1997) 267\u00ad87).  Excavation  and  identification of  the  oikos  of  the Naxians  known  from  C 4  texts  (I.D\u00e9los 104\u00ad25.5,  etc.)  have shown  that  the  building  began  in  C 7s  (Courbin  ( 1980); Bruneau  and  Ducat  ( 1983)  119\u00ad23;  Gruben  ( 1997)  301\u00ad50). The  Propylaia  I  and  II  of  C 5  have  recently  been  claimed  as Naxian  work  (Gruben  ( 1997)  350\u00ad72).  The  Naxians  dedicat- ed  a  stoa  in  C 6l  (Hellmann  and  Fraisse  ( 1979)  85\u00ad124; Bruneau  and  Ducat  ( 1983)  146\u00ad47).The  famous  lions,  one  of the  original  sixteen  now  gracing  St.  Mark's  Square  in  Venice, were  given  in  C 7l  (Gallet  de  Santerre  ( 1959)  21\u00ad36;  Bruneau and  Ducat  ( 1983)  171\u00ad74).A  less  spectacular  dedication  is  the gold    ,  attested  by  an  inscription  of 365/3 and,  as  has  recently  been  shown,  by  Athenaios  (I.D\u00e9los 104.34\u00ad35  with  Bruneau  ( 1990)  568\u00ad71;  for  the  gold,  see  IG xi.2  161.B.31).  At  Delphi,  the  Naxians  dedicated  the  famous Sphinx,  for  which  they  had  received  promanteia  (Syll. \u00b3292 with 17a  (from  332);  Amandry  ( 1953);  a  base  reinscribed  in C 4  suggests  another  dedication,  but  may  be  related  to  the Sphinx;  see  Jacquemin  ( 1999)  69,  and  contributed  funds  to rebuilding  the  sanctuary  after  the  earthquake  of 373  (CID ii 4.i.16\u00ad17  for  the  polis  as  a  whole, 20\u00ad27  for  individual Naxians).  The  Naxians  also  participated  in  the  communal dedications  at  Delphi  and  Olympia  after  Plataia  (ML  27.8; Paus. 5.23.2;  cf.  Hdt. 9.81). The  Naxians  may  well  have  controlled  some  of  the  small- er  islands  to  the  south-east,  although  there  is  no  direct  evi- dence.  These  would  include  the  archipelago  of  the Phakous(s)ai  (Steph.  Byz. 655.3\u00ad4;  late  inscriptions:  IG xii.7 507\u00ad8),  Herakleia  (IG xii.7509  with  L.  Robert  ( 1949))  and Nikasia  (Suda  N 377;  Plin.  HN 4.68). The  Naxians  minted  coins  from  c. 600,  first silver staters and  trihemiobols  on  the  Aiginetan  standard.  Types:  obv. kantharos  with  or  without  a  crown;  rev.  incuse  square.  The coins  with  kantharos  and  crown  were  apparently  replaced c. 500  by  coins  with  the  plain  kantharos,  which  had  begun production  a  few  years  earlier.  The  Naxians  continued  to strike  these  types  until  their  defection  from  the  Delian League  in  c. 475\u00ad470  (Nicolet-Pierre  ( 1997)).  In  C 4  they struck  silver  drachms  and  obols  on  the  Rhodian  standard  as well  as  bronze  coins.  Types:  obv.  Dionysos;  rev.  kantharos; legend: or (Head,  HN \u00b2  488;  SNG  Cop. Aegean  Islands 702\u00ad9).A  Naxian  tetradrachm  appears  in  the Delian  accounts  starting  in  364/3  (I.D\u00e9los 104.66\u00ad67).  For possible  attribution  of some  half-staters  on  the Milesian/Phoenician  standard  to  Naxos  instead  of  Anaphe (no. 474),  see  Erxleben  ( 1970)  69\u00ad70,  73. Naxian  participation  in  the  colonisation  of  Naxos  (no. 41) on  Sicily  is  suggested  by  Hellan.  fr. 82;  it  has  sometimes  been doubted,  but  now  seems  confirmed b y  an  inscription (Guarducci  ( 1985);  for  a  good  summary,  see  Costa  ( 1997) 87\u00ad102).  Naxian  claims  of  colonisation  on  Amorgos  (Steph. Byz. 86.14;  schol.  Dionys.  Per. 525)  may  be  Hellenistic  inven- tions  designed  to  justify  the  occupation  of  Aigiale  (no. 471) and  Minoa  (no. 473)  (Nigdelis  ( 1990)  23). 508.

The  toponym  is ,  (IG xi.4  539.7  (C 4l/C3e);  but  note  that  this  is  an  hon- orific decree for an individual described as  '    ;  cf.  also  L.

The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  262.ii.9;  I.D\u00e9los 98.A.13;  coins,  see  infra),  in  late  sources  sometimes (Ath. 30D,  perhaps  quoting  Eparchides  (FGrHist 437)  fr. 1).  In  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  the  community  is referred to as     '(IGi\u00b3262.ii.9,262. ii.9\u00ad10, 263.ii.2\u00ad3)  or   '  (IG i\u00b3  263.ii.2).  Oine  is  referred  to as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  the  term  at Ps.-Skylax 740 reger 58.  It  is  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  a  C 4  proxeny decree  (IG xii.6  1224.5;  see  also  I.D\u00e9los 98.A.13  and  B. 5 ( 377\u00ad373),  where  the      '  are  listed  under  the heading:     (A. 11,B.1).  The  collective use  of the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on  coins:  (Head,  HN \u00b2602,from c. 300)  and  externally  in  the  Athenian tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  262.ii.9).  The  earliest  attestation  of  the individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  from  C 2e  (IG xi.4 811.3\u00ad4). Oine  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Ionian  district  (IG i\u00b3  269.i.9)  and  is  recorded  in  the  trib- ute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.7)  to  429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.iv.57) a  total  of  fifteen times,  once  completely  restored,  paying  a phoros  of  first  1  tal., 2,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.7\u00ad8),  reduced  to  1 tal.  in  447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.i.30)  and  further  reduced  to  4,000  dr. in  the  following  year  (IG i\u00b3  266.i.9),  but  raised  again  to  1  tal. in 433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.i.52\u00ad53).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.175\u00ad76).  Apart  from  membership  of  the Delian  League  and  contributions  to  the  Delian Amphiktyony,  the  only  two  pieces  of  information  we have about  Oine  as  a  political  community  are  the  Oinaians'  grant of  proxenia  to  a  citizen  of  Byzantion  (no. 674)  (IG xii.6  1224 (C 4))  and  a  grant  of  proxenia  by  the  Delians  (no. 478)  to  a citizen  of  Oine  (IG xi.4  539  (C 4l/C3e)). The  ancient  settlement  was  once  thought  to  occupy  a  hill (an  acropolis)  near  modern  Kambos,  but  in  1939  Politis showed  that  there  was  no  ancient  settlement  on  the  hill;  he favoured  a  location  by  the  sea  on  the  left  bank  of  the  river  that flows b y  Kambos  into  the  sea  (Politis  ( 1939\u00ad40)  139\u00ad43).  The polis  centre  is  located  on  the  north  coast.  It  seems  likely  that Oine's territory included  the  western  part  of  the  island,  and thus  the  temple  of  Artemis  Tauropolos.  Graves  and  villages  of Classical  date  have  been  reported  (N.  Zapheiropoulos ( 1963a),  ( 1963b)). The  Tauropolion,  the  sanctuary  of  Artemis  (Strabo 14.1.19),  was  located  on  the  north  coast,  c. 9  km  west  of  Oine, in  whose  territory  it  surely  was  (though  it  seems  to  have operated  in  some  sense  as  an  island-wide  sanctuary,  perhaps rather  like  Klopedi  on  Lesbos).  Ceramics  start  in  C 7,  and building  by  C 6,  and  continuously  thereafter  (Papalas  ( 1983); Politis  ( 1939\u00ad40);  Ph.  Zapheiropoulou  ( 1989)).  Recent  finds of  rock-cut  inscriptions  mention  the  Theoi  Samothrakoi (Hatzianastasiou  ( 1981)  378). 481.  *Therma  (Thermaios) Map. 61.  Lat. 37.40,long. 26.10.  Size  of  territory: 3  ( 125  km \u00b2).  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is unattested.  In  the  Hellenistic  period  the  urban  centre  was called (Strabo  14.1.19)  after  the  nearby promon- tory.  The  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.9\u00ad10, 261.v.6\u00ad7).  In  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  the  community  is referred to as \u00b5    '  ( 262.ii.2\u00ad3)  or   '  (IG i\u00b3  263.ii.36\u00ad37).  The  Thermaioi  are  referred  to as  having  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  the  term  at Ps.-Skylax 58.For polis  in  the  political  sense,  see  I.D\u00e9los 98.A.14  and  B. 4\u00ad5  ( 377\u00ad373),where  the  \u00b5    ' are  listed  under  the  heading      (A. 11,B.1). The  collective  use  of  the  ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  the Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.9\u00ad10).  The  earliest  attes- tation  of  the  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  from  C 2e  (IG xi.4  811.3\u00ad4).  Asklepios  has  been  suggested  as  the  chief  deity on  the  basis  of  the  Hellenistic  renaming  of  the  city  as Asklepieis  (L.  Robert  ( 1969\u00ad90)  i. 549\u00ad68). Therma  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Ionian  district  (IG i\u00b3  269.i.4)  and  is  recorded  in  the tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.9\u00ad10)  to  429/8  (IG i\u00b3 282.iv.35),  a  total  of  fifteen times,  once  completely  restored, paying  a  phoros  of 3,000  dr.  in  all  years  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.9\u00ad10). The  urban  centre  was  located  on  the  south-east  coast  of the  island.  A  nearby  cemetery  shows  use  from  the  Archaic period  (Leekley  and  Noyes  ( 1975)  20).  Ancient  remains  are few  (a  bath  complex  has  been  reported  (Lauffer  ( 1989)  278; Pleket  ( 1960))  because  most  of  the  site  slid  into  the  sea,  per- haps  as  a  result  of  an  earthquake  in  198  (Papalas  ( 1992)  122). 482.Ikos  (Ikios) Map  55.  Lat. 39.10,long.  23.55.  Size  of  ter- ritory: 2  ( 65  km \u00b2).  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is  ,  (Ps.- Skymnos  582)  or  '  (Strabo  9.5.16),  denoting  both  the island  and  the  town  (Ps.-Skylax  58).  The  city-ethnic  is   (IG i\u00b3  262.iv.2).  The  island  is  sometimes  regarded  as  one  of the  Kyklades  (Steph.  Byz. 330.8),  but  Strabo  groups  it  with the  islands  that  lie  off  Magnesia  (Strabo  9.5.16).  Ps.-Skylax  58 calls  the  island  ,  principally  in  the  urban  sense,  but no  trace  of  two  poleis  recurs  in  the  sources  (which  are  mea- gre)  or  the  archaeology  (likewise).  The  political  sense  is attested  in  IG ii\u00b2  43.78  and 84,where  the  Ikioi  under  the  head- ing are  listed  as  members  of  the  Second  Athenian Naval  League.  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  appears internally  on  amphora  stamps  (infra)  and  externally  in  the Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  262.iv.2).  The  individual  and external  use  is  attested  in  an  Attic  sepulchral  inscription  (IG ii\u00b2  8936  (C 4f)).  The  amphora  stamps  inscribed  (IG xii.8665)  or  (nominative  neuter  singular)  are  from C 3  or  earlier  (Doulgeri-Intzessiloglou  and  Garlan  ( 1990)  388 with  n. 78,  373  fig. 7;  cf.  Garlan  ( 1999)  19). Ikos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Thracian  district  (IG i\u00b3  271.ii.51)  and  is  recorded  in  the the  aegean  741 tribute  lists  from  451/0  (IG i\u00b3  262.iv.2)  to  429/8  (IG i\u00b3 282.ii.18),  a  total  of  seventeen  times,  twice  completely restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1,500  dr.  in  all  years  (IG i\u00b3 262.iv.2).Ikos  also  joined  the  Second  Athenian  Confederacy in  the  370s  (IG ii\u00b2  43.84).  Remains  of  the  ancient  urban  cen- tre  on  the  south-eastern  coast  of  the  island  include  fortifica- tion  walls  of  C 4  (Philippson  ( 1959)  48).  An  atelier  for  the production  of  amphoras  has  been  found  at  Tsoukalia,  dat- ing  from  the  Classical  period  and  later;  finds include stamps marked  or (supra).  Farmsteads  of  C 4  have also  been  located  (BCH 124  ( 2000)  960\u00ad61). 483.Imbros  (Imbrios) Map  51.Lat.40.10,long.25.45.Size of  territory: 4  ( 275  km \u00b2).Type:A.The  toponym  is  \u00b5, (Hom.  Il. 13.33;  Hymn.  Hom.  Ap. 36;  Thuc. 8.102.2;  F.Delphes iii.1497.14  (C 4l/C3e)),  denoting  both  the  island  and  the town  (Ps.-Skylax  67).  The  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5  (Archil. 114.3,  West;  IG i\u00b3  265.ii.112).  Imbros  is  called  a  polis  in  the urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skylax  67  and  in  the  political  sense  in  the King's  Peace  (Xen.  Hell. 5.1.31).  In the  Athenian  tribute  lists the  Imbrians  are  twice  recorded  under  the  heading  h  (IG i\u00b3  282.Bi.15\u00ad16,  19,  285.i.107\u00ad8,  110).  The  collective use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on  coins  (infra) and  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (infra).  For  the external  and  individual  use,  see  Archil. 114.3.A C 5s  Athenian sepulchral  inscription  has,  instead,  \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  1350). Like  Lemnos,  Imbros  was  seized  by  the  Athenians  c. 500 (Hdt. 6.41.2\u00ad4,  104.1;  see  Salomon  ( 1997)  45)  and  resettled with  expatriate  Athenians.  The  Imbrians  were  members  of the  Delian  League.  Imbros  belonged  to  the  Island  district  (IG i\u00b3  269.v.34),  which  indicates  that,  like  the  Lemnians,  the Imbrians  were  allies  (Thuc. 3.5.1,  7.57.2,  8.102\u00ad3)  and  not Athenian  klerouchs  like  the  Skyrians  (Graham  ( 1983)  175\u00ad84; Salomon  ( 1997)  31\u00ad66;  cf.  Cargill  ( 1995)  5\u00ad6).  Imbros  is recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.ii.112)  to 421/20  (IG i\u00b3  285.i.110)  a  total  of  twelve  times,  five times c om- pletely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 3,300  dr.  in  447/6  (IG i\u00b3 265.ii.112),raised  to  1  tal.  in,  perhaps, 442/1  (IG i\u00b3  270.v.36).In 429/8  Imbros  is  listed  among  poleis  which  ~ \u00b5 (present  a  voucher  for  tribute),  presumably  con- tributing  to  the  maintenance  of  the  Hellespontophylakes  and serving  as  bases  for  the  fleet patrolling the H ellespontine waters  (IG i\u00b3  282.Bi.15\u00ad16,  19;  cf.  IG i\u00b3  285.i.107\u00ad8,  10;  Thuc. 2.24.1).Imbros  was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.98) ( 1  tal.,  but  both  ethnic  and  amount  restored).  In  the  Peace  of 404  Athens  had  to surrender  Imbros  (Andoc. 3.12;  Aeschin. 2.76\u00ad77),  but  by 392,  after  a  short  period  of  independence (Andoc. 3.12,  14)  the  Athenians  had  regained  control  of  the island  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.15),  and  Athenian  possession  was  con- firmed b y  the  King's  Peace  of 386  (Xen.  Hell. 5.1.31).  Like Lemnos  (Agora xix  L 3.13,  20,  22,  33,  42,  47),  Imbros  was  now inhabited  by  Athenian  klerouchs.  For  the  view  that  only some  of  the  inhabitants  were  klerouchs,  whereas  the  rest were  naturalised  Imbrians,  see  Salomon  ( 1997)  75\u00ad76. Imbros  was  still  Athenian  in  the  320s  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 62.2;  IG ii\u00b2  3206;  cf.  SEG 39  211),  and  remained  Athenian  by  the  Peace of 322  (Diod. 18.18.4;  see  Cargill  ( 1995)  42\u00ad58).  In  C 4  the Imbrians  were  in  full  possession  of  Athenian  citizenship (Dem. 4.34,  7.4;  Aeschin. 2.72). As  an  Athenian  dependency  the  Imbrian  state  is  called \u00b5   \u00b5  (IG xii.846;  IG ii\u00b2  3206,cf. SEG 39.211  (c. 325))  or  \u00b5   \u00b5  (IG ii\u00b2  3203 (C 4m)),  but  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  it  is  given  as \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  265.ii.112,etc.).All  attestations  of  civic  subdi- visions  copy  Athens:  citizens  were  organised  into  the Kleisthenic  phylai  and  demoi  (IG xii.863  ( 352/1)),  and retained  this  system  even  after  Imbros  had  broken  away from  Athens  (IG xii.847  (c. 318\u00ad307));  see  Jones,  POAG 187\u00ad88.  Both  when  the  Imbrians  were part  of  the  Athenian state  (IG xii.846  (c. 350\u00ad325))  and  when  they  were  inde- pendent  (IG xii.847\u00ad48  (c. 318\u00ad307)),decrees  were  proposed in  accordance  with  a  probouleumatic  procedure  ( 46.4\u00ad7) and  passed  by  the  boule  and  the  demos  ( 46.1,  47.13,  48.6\u00ad7)  in an ( 47.3,  48.4)  presided  over  by an  epistates  and two  symproedroi  ( 47.3\u00ad4,  48.4\u00ad5).  The  eponymous  official was  the  Athenian  archon  when  Imbros  was  part  of  the Athenian  state  (IG xii.863.1)  and  the  island's  own  archon when  Imbros  was  independent  (IG xii.847.9),  but  see Cargill  ( 1995)  146;  Sherk  ( 1990)  270\u00ad72.  An  Athenian  law  of 374/3  regulates  the  8  per  cent  tax  on  grain  imports  from Imbros  (Stroud  ( 1998)  4\u00ad5;  cf.  IG ii\u00b2  1672.297).  One  month- name  is  known:  Hekatombaion,  an  Athenian  reflection ( IG xii.847;  see  Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 117). The  patron  deity  was  Athena  Polias  (IG xii.858.10).There was  a  cult  of  the  Twelve  Gods  (IG xii.863  ( 352/1)),  and  the famous  Kabeirion  for  the     attested  in inscriptions  (IG xii.851,  71\u00ad74  (all  Hell.);  cf.  Fredrich  ( 1908) 97\u00ad99)  and  by  Strabo  ( 10.3.21)  (see  Hemberg  ( 1950)  37\u00ad43). Steph.  Byz. 331.14\u00ad15  reports  a  sanctuary  of  Hermes,  whose worship  is  attested  in  C 4  (IG xii.868\u00ad69;  Fredrich  ( 1908) 100).  The  chief  Imbrian  river  was  called  the  Ilisus  (Plin.  HN 4.72),no  doubt  an  echo  of  Attika  to  be  attributed  to  the  kler- ouchs  (see  Fredrich  ( 1908)  82).  The  urban  centre  has remains,  including  a  city  wall,  that  have  been  dated  to  C 4 (Fredrich  ( 1908)  85\u00ad88).  The  island  is  still  little  explored archaeologically. 742 reger The  Imbrians  struck  bronze  coins  in  C 4s.

The  city-ethnic  is '  (IG xii.5 1002.3  (C 4);  I.D\u00e9los 98A.13  ( 377/6)).  Ios  is  called  a  polis  both in  the  urban  sense  (Ps.-Skylax 58)  and  in  the  political  sense (IG xii.5  1002.3  (C 4)).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic is  attested  internally  on  coins  (infra)  and  in  inscriptions (IG xii.5  1002\u00ad4  (C 4l);  IG xii  suppl. 168  (C 4  in  LGPN,but for  the  Antigonos  as  Gonatas,  not  Monophthalmos,  see Habicht  ( 1996))  and  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists (infra)  and  on  Delos  (I.D\u00e9los 98A.13  ( 377/6)).  The  individ- ual  and  external  use  appears  also  on  inscriptions  of  Delos (I.D\u00e9los 76.3  (C 4s);  I.D\u00e9los 10426.C.2  Choix  no. 12  (C 4), 104\u00ad26B(C4m),  which  record  the  acquittal  of  an  Ietan tried  in  Athens;  cf.  Stumpf  ( 1987)  211\u00ad13).  Patris  is  found  in Arist.  fr. 76,  Rose. Ios  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the Island  district  (IG i\u00b3  269.v.27)  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute lists  from  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  259.vi.14)  to  416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.20),  a total  of  sixteen  times,  twice  completely  restored,  paying  a phoros  of 1  tal.  in  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.vi.14)  to  452/1  ( 261.i.13), lowered  to  840  dr.  in  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.23),  but  raised  to 3,000  dr.  in  433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.i.87)  or  some  years  before.

Seleinous  is implicitly  referred  to as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  the  term at  Ps.-Skylax  58.  The  only  explicit  testimony  for Seleinous  as  a  polis  is  an  inscription  of  Roman  imperial  date, at  which  time  the  island  was  under  Athenian  control  (IG xii.8  661.3).  It  has  been  identified as a polis  from  C 4  mainly because  Ps.-Skylax  says  that  Peparethos  was  tripolate,  and  it is  the  only  other  known  candidate.  But  city  walls  are  pre- served  at  Seleinous  that  have  been  dated  to  C 4,  and  a  temple has  been  reported  (Fredrich  ( 1906b)  122\u00ad23;  but  see Scranton  ( 1941)  168  on  the  walls).

The  city-ethnic  is  (I.D\u00e9los 98A.16 ( 377/6)).Delos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  through- out  C 4  (I.D\u00e9los 36.2  CEG ii  836;  I.D\u00e9los 74.15\u00ad16:    ).  In Ps.-Skylax  58 is  one  of  the toponyms  listed  after  the  heading      .The collective use of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  inter- nally  in  inscriptions  (IG i\u00b3  1460.14  ( 410/9);  I.D\u00e9los 71.2 (C 5/C4),  74.7  (C 4s))  and  on  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in inscriptions  (IG i\u00b3  130.19  (c. 432))  and  in  literary  sources (Hdt. 6.97.1;  Thuc. 5.1;Hyp.  fr. 74,  Sauppe).  The  individual use  is  attested  both  internally  (I.D\u00e9los 98A.16  ( 377/6))  and externally  at  Athens  and  Karthaia  on  Keos  (IG i\u00b3  1349  (c. 530); IG xii.5542.49  (C 4)). Strabo  ( 10.5.1)  carefully  excludes  Delos  from  the Kyklades,  which  are,  rather,  the  islands  around  it.  The  territ- ory  of  Delos  was  of  course  fundamentally  the  island  itself, but  ever  since  Polykrates  of  Samos  attached  Rheneia  (no. 514)  to  Delos  by  a  chain  (Thuc. 3.104.2,  cf. 1.13.6;  Shipley ( 1987)  94\u00ad97),  the  Delians  controlled  the  southern  half  of Rheneia  below  the  isthmus  which  divides  the  island  into  two unequal  halves,  as  well  as  the  eastern  part  of  the  half  above the  isthmus  (see  the  sketch  map  in  Kent  ( 1948)  248  fig. 3). 738 reger This  land  supported  several  sanctuaries  (see  infra)  and  the necessary  Delian  cemeteries,  given  the  prohibition  against burial  on  the  sacred  island  (see  Couilloud  ( 1974)).  By  C 4  the rest  of  Delian  territory  on  Rheneia  was  divided  into  eleven sacred  estates  (temene),  which  were  rented  out  on  contract; these  no  doubt  were  established  soon  after  the  Rheneian  ter- ritory  came  into  Delian  possession  (I.D\u00e9los 89,  104\u00ad11A; Kent  ( 1948)  245\u00ad52;  Charre  and  Couilloud-Le  Dinahet ( 1999)).  The  Delians  also  owned  property  on  Syros  (I.D\u00e9los 104\u00ad11A21)  and  Tenos  (I.D\u00e9los 104\u00ad8B46  (C 4s);  cf.  I.D\u00e9los 104\u00ad32.4,  apparently  under  an  entry  referring  to houses rented  out:        [  ---),  perhaps  having  come into  Delian  possession  as  a  result  of  foreclosure  for  unpaid loans  (\u00c9tienne  ( 1990)  183;  contra  Reger  ( 1994b)  227\u00ad28,  and infra). In  the  Archaic  period  Delos  was  under  the  sway  of  the Naxians  (no. 507)  (generally,  see  Gallet  de  Santerre  ( 1958)), though  there  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  the  Delians  thereby ceased  to  enjoy  the  status  of  a  polis.  Under  Peisistratos  the Athenians  claimed  Delos  and  carried  out  a  purification (cf. Lanzillotta  ( 1996)  275\u00ad79).  When  Datis  passed  by  Delos  in 490,  the  islanders  fled t o  Tenos,  but  he  respected  the  sancti- ty  of  the  island  and  called  them  back  (Hdt. 6.97.1).  After  the end  of  the  Persian  War  the  Athenians  chose  Delos  as  head- quarters  of  the  Delian  League;  meetings  were  held  in  the sanctuary  (Thuc. 1.96.2).  The  sanctuary  was  controlled  by an  amphiktyony  under  the  Athenians  ( 478?\u00ad404).  In  426/5 the  Athenians  carried  out  renewed  purifications ( Thuc. 1.8.1,  3.104),  and  in  422  they  expelled  the  Delians,  who  were permitted  by  the  Persians  to  live  at  Adramyttion  (no. 800) (Thuc. 5.1,  8.108.4:  calling  the  action  a  metoikismos;  Paus. 4.27.9);  but  at  least  some  of  them  were brought  back  to Delos  in  421  (Thuc. 5.32.1).  After  the  end  of  the Peloponnesian  War  the  Delians  enjoyed  political  autonomy from  404  to 394,  though  subject  to  a  subordinate  treaty  with the  Spartans  (no. 345)  (I.D\u00e9los 87  Choix  no. 8  ( 402\u00ad399); see  Prost  ( 2001)).In  394  the  Athenians  again  secured  control over  the  sanctuary  (though  not  the  Delian  polis),  which  they held  and  administered  through  another  amphiktyony  until 314,  sometimes  with  the  co-operation  of  the  Andrians  (no. 475)  (see  e.g.  I.D\u00e9los 97.5;  97bis  12; 98.A63, 64, 96; 100.7, 10, Andrian  amphiktyoneis). Aristotle  wrote  a  Constitution  of  the  Delians  (no. 38  and frr. 495\u00ad97,  Gigon).  Several  Delian  laws  have  been  preserved epigraphically,  including  an  exclusion  of  xenoi  from  a  sanc- tuary,  perhaps  the  temenos  of  the  Archegetes  (I.D\u00e9los 68 (C 4),  with  Butz  ( 1996)  78\u00ad82;  Le  Guen-Pollet  ( 1991)  77\u00ad79 no. 22,  and  Vallois  ( 1929)  209  n. 2),  and  a  regulation  to  keep  a spring  clean  (I.D\u00e9los 69  (C 4f);  Le  Guen-Pollet  ( 1991)  61\u00ad62 no. 14  (C 5)).  A  grant  of  ateleia  is  known  (I.D\u00e9los 71  Choix no. 6  (C 4?)).  In  376/5  a  fine and permanent e xile  was imposed  on  Delians  who  had  seized  amphiktyoneis  in  the sanctuary  of  Apollo,  dragged  them  out,  and  beaten  them (I.D\u00e9los 98B24\u00ad52).  A  stasis  between  a  pro-Athenian  and  an anti-Athenian  faction  in  the  330s  can  be  inferred  from  an Athenian  citizenship  decree  to  an  exiled  citizen  of  Delos  and his  family  (IG ii\u00b2  222;  cf.  Gehrke,  Stasis 49).  A  fragment  of Hyperides'  Delian  Speech  (fr. 74)  recounts  a  lawsuit  between the  Delians  and  the  Rheneians  over  responsibility  for  the deaths  of  Aiolian  visitors  on  Rheneia. The  Delians  bestowed  proxenia  on  citizens  of  Athens  (no. 361)  (I.D\u00e9los 74  (C 4l)),  Ios  (no. 484)  (I.D\u00e9los 76),  and  Kition (IG xi.4512  (C 4l)),  and  proxenia  combined  with  citizenship on  a  citizen  of  Byzantion  (no. 674)  (IG xi.4510  (C 4l)). Delian  citizens  were  appointed  proxenoi  by Athens  (I.D\u00e9los 88  ( 368)),  Karthaia  (IG xii.5542.49  (C 4m));  see  Marek ( 1984)  71\u00ad73,  247\u00ad80. The  eponymous  official of  Delos  was  an  archon  (IG i\u00b3 1460.9\u00ad10  ( 410/9);  I.D\u00e9los 87  (c. 403);  Sherk  ( 1990)  269\u00ad70). We  hear  of  prytaneis  (I.D\u00e9los 88  Choix 10  ( 369/8)),  a  boule (I.D\u00e9los 71  (C 5/C4),72)  and  an  assembly  (I.D\u00e9los 88  ( 369/8)). Decrees  were  passed  typically  by  the  boule  and  the  demos (I.D\u00e9los 71\u00ad73  (C 5/C4\u00ad390s)),the  latter  sometimes  simply  as (I.D\u00e9los 71);  occasionally  a  named  person  moved  the  decree  (I.D\u00e9los 73  ( 390s),  74  (C 4e)).  Other  known  offi- cials  include  an  arxas  stephanephoros  (I.D\u00e9los 37  (C 4)), hieropoioi  (I.D\u00e9los 73  ( 390s)),  grammateus  of  the  boule (I.D\u00e9los 88),  an  epistates  (I.D\u00e9los 88),  and  strategoi  (I.D\u00e9los 88).  Neokoroi  appear  as  helpers  of  the  amphiktyoneis  until 409  or 408;  thereafter  they  are  called  episkopoi  or  epitropoi (I.D\u00e9los 93.10\u00ad15  and 94.4).  The  civic  subdivisions  (clearly modelled  on  Athens)  (Jones,  POAG 211\u00ad12)  comprised  four phylai  (only is  known  by  name:  IG xi.4  1155.3 (C 3f)),  several  trittyes  (e.g. (IG xi.2199A.12  ( 275);  cf.  Bruneau  and  Ducat  ( 1983)  123).  The protective  deity  was  of  course  Apollo  Delios  (Ananios  1.1,  West \u00b2;  Hymn.  Hom.  Ap.  passim;  Pind.  Pae. 5,Race; on  Pindar's  conections  with  Delos,  see  Simon  ( 1997);  on  the  tradition  of  Apollo's  birth,  see  Le  Roy  ( 1973)).  The  cult  statue  of  Apollo  made  by  Tektaios  and  Angelion  (Paus. 2.32.5,  9.35.3)  replaced  a  xoanon  taken  to Epidelion  (Paus. 3.23.3).  There  was  also  a  xoanon  of  Aphrodite  (Paus. 9.40.3\u00ad4).  The  dedication  to  Athena  Polias  (I.D\u00e9los 15  LSAG 306  no. 42  (C 6l)),  which  is  carved  on  a  column  of the  bouleuterion,  should  probably  be  attributed  to the Athenians. the  aegean  739 Apollo's  sanctuary,  which  can  be  traced  back  to  Bronze Age  roots,  was  the  chief of  Delos  (Courby  ( 1931)  1\u00ad106; Bruneau  and  Ducat  ( 1983)  130\u00ad33),  but  of  course  the  tiny island  was  saturated  with  sanctuaries.  These  include  an Artemision  on  Delos  which  dates  in  its  original  form  to C 7 (I.D\u00e9los 73  ( 390s);  Bruneau  and  Ducat  ( 1983)  154\u00ad59)  and  an \u00b5      recently  shown  to  have  been  located on  Rheneia  (Tr\u00e9heux  ( 1995));  a  Heraion  dating  from  C 7 (Plassart  ( 1928);  Bruneau  and  Ducat  ( 1983)  230\u00ad31);  a Letoon  built  c. 540  (Gallet  de  Santerre  ( 1959)  37\u00ad72;  Bruneau and  Ducat  ( 1983)  168\u00ad71);  a  Dodekatheon  to  the  Twelve Gods,  but  which  had  only  altars  in  C 5\u00adC4  (Will  ( 1955); Bruneau  and  Ducat  ( 1983)  165\u00ad66);  an  Archegesion  for Anios,  the  founder  of  Delos,  of  C 6e  (F.  Robert  ( 1953); Bruneau  and  Ducat  ( 1983)  200\u00ad1;  Bruneau  ( 1970)  413\u00ad30  on the  cult);  an  Aphrodision  which  was  consecrated  C 4l (Roussel  ( 1987)  240\u00ad42;  Bruneau  ( 1970)  331\u00ad44;  Bruneau and  Ducat  ( 1983)  213\u00ad14).  Delos  is  also  rich  in  public  build- ings:  the  ekklesiasterion  dates  from  C 5e  (Hansen  and Fischer-Hansen  ( 1994)  61\u00ad62;  Vallois  ( 1929)  278\u00ad302; Bruneau  and  Ducat  ( 1983)  159);  the  bouleuterion  from  C 6f (Gneisz  ( 1990)  45\u00ad46,  315  no. 17;  cf.  I.D\u00e9los 84  (c. 300));  the prytaneion  was  begun  before  C 4m  (\u00c9tienne  ( 1997);  Bruneau and  Ducat  ( 1983)  135\u00ad37;  S.  G.  Miller  ( 1978)  67\u00ad78,  as  C 5; cf.  also  IG xi  2.144.A.98,  101);  the  hieropoion  is  C 4l (Tr\u00e9heux  ( 1987)).  The  impressive  theatre  (TGR  ii. 192\u00ad94) goes  back  to  C 4  but  was  not  finished till C 3m  (IG xi.2  287.A 92\u00ad93,  work  still  going  on  in  250;  Vallois  ( 1944)  220\u00ad38). As  a  sacred  site  Delos  was  always  unwalled  (see  Rigsby ( 1996)  51\u00ad53);  for  Datis,  see  supra;  on  the  \"battle  of  Delos\" inferred  from  Hippoc.  Epid. 5.61  and 7.33,see F.Robert ( 1973)).  The  city  seems  originally  to  have  occupied  land north  of  the  sanctuary;  the  habitation  quarter  known  as  the Quartier  du  Th\u00e9\u00e2tre  was  a  C 3  development  (Chamonard ( 1922)),  and  of  course  the  great  period  of  expansion  on Delos  fell  in  the  decades  after  the  Romans  gave  Delos  back  to the  Athenians  in  167  (Roussel  ( 1987)  passim;  Habicht  ( 1997) 246\u00ad63).  On  the  harbour  facilities  of  Delos,  see  Duch\u00eane and  Fraisse  ( 2001). Delos  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Euboic  standard  from  C 6l to C 5e,stopping  after  478.The  Archaic  and  Classical  coinage of  Delos  still  lacks  a  thorough  scholarly  study  (Hackens ( 1973);  Bruneau  and  Ducat  ( 1983)  107\u00ad11;  V.  Chankowski  is planning  such  a  study).

According  to  Ps.-Skylax  58,  Ikaros  was  ,  and indeed  two  poleis,  Oinoe  and  Thermai,  are  known.  Unlike other  islands  with  multiple  poleis,  the  inhabitants  do  not always  appear  simply  as  Ikarians.  Both  poleis  were  members of  the  Delian  League  but  always  paid  separately;  in  the  trib- ute  lists  they  are  recorded  as      '  (IG i\u00b3 263.ii.2\u00ad3)  or   '  (IG i\u00b3  262.ii.9\u00ad10)  and  as \u00b5    '  (IG i\u00b3  261.vV.6\u00ad7)  or   '  (IG i\u00b3  262.ii.2\u00ad3).  Both  poleis  are  attested  fifteen times in  the  tribute  lists  (infra),  but  only  twice  are  they  recorded  next  to  each  other  ( 264.i.27\u00ad8,  265.i.29\u00ad30).  According  to Anaximenes  of  Lampsakos,  Ikaros  was  \"settled\"  by Milesians  (no. 854)  (FGrHist 72)  fr. 26);  the  date  must  be  C 4 or  earlier,  perhaps  in  the  Archaic  period  (Manganaro ( 1963\u00ad64)  297);  if  Archaic,  perhaps  starting  with  the Milesian  expedition  against  Naxos,  the  island  had  expelled the  Milesians  by  c. 478  (see  Ehrhardt  ( 1983)  18\u00ad19).  There  are no  known  coins  struck  as  island  issues  (see  L.  Robert ( 1969\u00ad90)  i. 333\u00ad34  n. 2,  554\u00ad55  n. 4). 480. ", "Eteokarpathioi": "Identifier: 489. , Map 60  (inset).  Lat. 35.35,long. 27.10.  Type:  [A].  Since  the  Eteokarpathians  were  organised as  a  koinon  (IG i\u00b3  1454.7,  12,  restored),  there  is  no  toponym. The  ethnic,  attested  only  in  the  plural,  is  ' (IG i\u00b3  1454.6,  11,  21,  28  ( 445\u00ad430)).  In the  Athenian  tribute lists  the  Eteokarpathians  are  listed  under  the  heading    \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.76\u00ad77, 81\u00ad82).  C. 445\u00ad430  the  Athenians  declared  a  Karpathian,  his children  and   '   as  euergetai  of the  Athenians,  and  the  koinon  was  declared  autonomous  (IG i\u00b3  1454.12:[ ]  \u00b5).  This  inscription  is  said  to  have been  found  at  Pini  (see  IG i\u00b3  p. 899),  which  is  located  in  the south-central  part  of  the  island.  If  the  inscription  was  found in  situ,  or  at  least  near  its  original  position,  this  site  should then  be  that  of  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo  where  the  cypress was  cut  for  Athena  in  Athens  (for  a  copy of  the  inscription was  to  be  erected   [    ]   ~ [   ]  \u00b5  [] (IG  i\u00b3  1454 35\u00ad37)  (for  the  view  that  the  tree  was  used  on  Karpathos,  not in  Athens,  see  Alfieri T onini  ( 1999)).No  material  earlier  than the  Hellenistic  period  seems,  however,  to  have  been  report- ed  (Leekley  and  Noyes  ( 1975)  27).  Sites  in  the  general  region with  Archaic  and/or  Classical  period  remains  have  been suggested  as  villages  of  the  Eteokarpathians  (Hope  Simpson and  Lazenby  ( 1962)  163\u00ad65).  After  the  Eteokarpathians  had been  declared  autonomous,  they  appear  in  the  Athenian tribute  lists  among  the  poleis  that  voluntarily  paid  phoros (    \u00b5),  viz.  in  the  years  434/3 (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.14),  433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.81\u00ad82)  and  432/1  (IG i\u00b3 280.ii.75,  restored).  Thereafter  they  appear  twice  as  regular members  of  the  League,  in  428/7  (IG i\u00b3  283.iii.1)  and  in 415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.i.23).  The  Eteokarpathians  seem  to  have had  no  separate  city,  but  a  separate  organisation  (ATL  i. 497),probably  set  up  by  the  Athenians  as  a  short-lived  splin- ter  community  of  Karpathos.  There  is  no  trace  of  their  exis- tence  after  C 5.  Thus,  they  are  not  likely  to have been  one  of the  three  poleis  on  Karpathos  recorded  by  Ps.-Skylax  in  C 4s. 489.

The  toponym  is ,  (Hdt. 7.90,  8.67.1;Strabo 10.5.3),  denoting  both the  island  and  the  town  (Ps.-Skylax  58).  The  city-ethnic  is (Hdt. 8.46.4;Dem.  13.34;  Agora xvii  526  (C 4))  or, once, (SEG 9.2.25).  Artemidoros  and  Strabo  agree in  placing  Kythnos  among  the  Kyklades  (Strabo  10.5.3). Kythnos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  (Ps.-Skylax  58), and  in  Hdt. 8.46.1  it  is  subsumed  under  the  heading  polis where polis  occurs  in  the  political  sense  (Hdt. 8.42.1,  49.1). The  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  collectively  in  inscriptions  (IG i\u00b3  264.iv.37;  SEG 25  357,  Nemea  (C 4l)) and  in  literary  sources  (Hdt. 8.46;Dem.  13.34),  and  individ- ually  in  Athenian  sepulchral  inscriptions  (IG ii\u00b2  9115; Agora xvii  526  (both  C 4))  and  in  a  C 5l  list  of  sailors  (IG i\u00b3 1032.vi.88\u00ad89). The  Kythnians  contributed  two  ships  to  the  Greek  fleet at Salamis  (Hdt. 8.46.4)  and  participated  in  the  communal dedications  at  Delphi  and  Olympia  after  Plataia  (ML  27.10; Paus. 5.23.2).  Kythnos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League, and  may  have  been  among  the  original  members  (ATL  iii. 198\u00ad99).  It  belonged  to  the  Island  district  (IG i\u00b3  271.i.91)  and is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.27)  to 416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.19)  a  total  of  eleven  times,  three  times the  aegean  755 completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of  first  3  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 263.iv.27),  raised  to  6  tal.  in,  probably, 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  288.i.5).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.72)  ( 6  tal.)  and  in 410/9  (IG i\u00b3  100.i.2).  Hypereides  wrote  a  (fr. 138,  Sauppe)  and  Aristotle  a     (Harp. 90).  In C 4s  the  Kythnians  had  a  board  of  five strategoi,of whom  three  were  elected  from  among  those  who  had  served as  strategoi  before  (Vat.  Gr. 2306.B.i.134\u00ad40).  During  the  cri- sis  of 330\u00ad326  Kythnos  received  10,000  medimnoi  of  grain from  Kyrene  (no. 1028)  (SEG 9.2.25). The  urban  centre  was  situated  in  the  north-western  part of  the  island  and  was  walled,  probably  by  C 4s  (Mazarakis Ainian  ( 1993),  ( 1996)  251,  256\u00ad70,(1998)  368\u00ad70;  Gounaris ( 1998)).  A  temple  on  the  acropolis,  which  has  produced material  of  the  Archaic  through  the  Hellenistic  periods,  has been  attributed  to Demeter,  or,  less  probably,  Artemis  or Hera  (Mazarakis  Ainian  ( 1998)  370\u00ad71);  for  a  temenos  on Kythnos  controlled  by  the  Athenian  sanctuary  of  Demeter at  Eleusis,  see  IG i\u00b3  386.iii.147.  Other  temples  of  uncertain identity  have  been  discovered;  one  of  these  may  be  a  sanctu- ary  of  Aphrodite,  whose  cult,  long  known  from  the Hellenistic  period  (IG v123.100\u00ad20  with  Themelis  ( 1998)), can  now  be  attested  from  a  C 4  dedication  (SEG 47  1300; Mazarakis  Ainian  ( 1998)  372\u00ad73).  A  C 4  sanctuary  to  the Samothrakian  gods  is  attested  epigraphically  (IG xii.5  1057 (C 4l/C3e);see  Hemberg  ( 1950)  220;Mazarakis  Ainian  ( 1998) 372)  and  archaeologically  (Mazarakis  Ainian  ( 1996)  252). The  doubts  of  Cole  ( 1984)  68  can  now  be  dismissed.  There  is now  evidence  for  a  settlement  starting  in  the  Geometric period  at  the  island  of  Vryokastraki  (Mazarakis  Ainian ( 1998)  374). The  island  is  said  to  have  taken  its  name  from  one Kythnos  (Steph.  Byz. 392.2);  later  it  was  settled  by  Athenians under  Kestor  and  Kephalenos  (Dio  Chrys. 80.26.9) The  Kythnians  now  seem  to  have  coined  in  silver  in  C 6l  or C 5e.

The  ethnic  is  \u00b5 (Thuc. 3.5.1;  IG i\u00b3  261.i.3).  Lemnos  is  called  a  polis  in  the political  sense  in  the  King's  Peace  (Xen.  Hell. 5.1.31).  Lemnos is  described  as  in  Eth.  Magn. 279.6;  cf.  schol. Ap.  Rhod. 1.601.  The  collective  use  of  the  ethnic  is  attested internally  on  coins: (Head,  HN \u00b2262  (C 4m))  and externally  in  a  list  of  mercenaries  (IG ii\u00b2  1956.91  (c. 300)).For the  individual  and  external  use  of  the  ethnic,  see   \u00b5  (Hdt. 8.11.3);  Antilochos,  the  philosopher  oppo- nent  of  Sokrates  (Diog.  Laert. 2.46);  Apollodoros,  a  writer on  farming  (Arist.  Pol. 1259a1);  and  \u00b5  (Isae. 6.13)  and Theoris  (Dem. 25.79\u00ad80  (C 4);  see  Collins  ( 2001)). Ancient  sources  mention  many  non-Greek  peoples  as inhabiting  Lemnos  before  the  arrival  of  the  Greeks  (see  IG xii.8,pp.  2\u00ad3).  C. 511  the  Persians  conquered  Lemnos, exposed  the  island  to  an  andrapodismos,  and  appointed  a hyparchos  (Hdt. 5.27.1\u00ad2).The  Lemnians  are  said  to  have  had military  forces  and  penteconters  (Hdt. 6.138.1).  In  499 Lemnos  was  seized  by  the  Athenians  (Hdt. 6.137\u00ad40;  IG i\u00b3  552 bis  and 1466  with  Rausch  ( 1999);  the  restoration  of  IG i\u00b3  518 is  uncertain;  see  also  Salomon  ( 1997)  31\u00ad37),  and  thereafter the  Lemnians  were  organised  into  the  Kleisthenic  tribes  and demes  (IG i\u00b3  522  bis, 1164\u00ad65  (C 5s);  IG xii  suppl. 337  (C 5e);  cf. Jones,  POAG 187\u00ad88).  Colonists,  however,  though  losing  cit- izen  rights  in  their  metropolis,  often  copied  its  civic  subdivi- sion,  and  it  seems  likely  that  in  C 5  the  Lemnians,  though organised  like  the  Athenians,  were  not  Athenian  citizens (Salomon  ( 1997)  31\u00ad66),  but  in  C 5m  they  were probably supplemented  with  klerouchs  (Graham  ( 1983)  175\u00ad84, ( 2001)  32526).  For  a  brief  period  between  404  and 394/3, Lemnos  was  free  of  Athenian  control;  see  Aeschin. 2.76; Andoc. 3.12.  In  C 4,  on  the  other  hand,  the  Lemnians  were indisputably  Athenian  klerouchs  (Agora xix  L 3  passim; Cargill  ( 1995)  5960) and Athenian citizens (Dem.4.34).It is a  moot  point  whether  it  is  possible  to  distinguish  between Athenian  klerouchs  and  Athenians  permanently  settled  on the  island,  as  argued  by  Salomon  ( 1997)  91\u00ad155. In 480  a  Lemnian  ship  defected  from  the  Persian  fleet (Hdt. 8.11.3).The  Lemnians  are  recorded  once  in  the  ATL  (IG i\u00b3  261.i.3  ( 452/1)).  Thereafter  all  payments  of  phoros  were made  by  the  Hephaistieis  and  the  Myrinaioi  separately (infra).  By  the  Peace  of 404  Athens  had  to surrender  Lemnos (Andoc. 3.12;Aeschin.2.76\u00ad77),but  by 392,after  a  short  peri- od  of  independence  (Andoc. 3.12,  14,  which  Salomon  ( 1997) 63\u00ad66  sees,  however,  as  in  reality  a  Spartan  hegemony,  reject- ing  the  standard  interpretation  of  IG xii.82  of  Myrina),  the Athenians  had  regained  control  of  the  island  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.15),  and  Athenian  possession  was  confirmed b y  the King's  Peace  of 386  (Xen.  Hell. 5.1.31).  The  grain  law  of 374/3 shows  that  Lemnos  was  an  Athenian  possession  (Hesperia suppl. 29  5.6\u00ad8),  in  spite  of  the  decision  of 378/7  to  renounce the  klerouchies  (Diod. 15.29.8).Lemnos  was  still  Athenian  in the 320s  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 62.2;  IG ii\u00b2  3207.28;  cf.  Cargill  ( 1995) 63\u00ad64)  and  remained  Athenian  by  the  Peace  of 322  (Diod. 756 reger 18.18.4;  see  Cargill  ( 1995)  42\u00ad58).  In  C 4  the  Athenians  seem to  have  had  an  archon  on  Lemnos  (Agora xix  L 3.5  ( 387/6)), and  from  the  350s  onwards  they  appointed  a  salaried  hippar- chos  eis  Lemnon  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 61.6,  62.2;Dem.  4.26;Bugh ( 1988)  209\u00ad18). In C 4m  the  Lemnians  struck  bronze  coins.

The  city-ethnic  is  (IG xii.768.1 (C 4/C3)).Aigiale  is  referred  to  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by the  term  at  Ps.-Skylax  58,  and  is  called  polis  in  the political  sense  in  IG xii.768.1  (C 4/C3),  where  the  internal and  collective  sense  of  the  city-ethnic  is  used.  The  external use  seems  to  be  unattested  until  C 2l,  when  the  collective use is  found  in  an  inscription  of  Magnesia  (Syll. \u00b3562.83).Aigiale was  situated  at  the  eastern  end  of  Amorgos;  there  are  walls  of Archaic  or  Classical  date,  and  sherds  testify  to  occupation until  C 4l  (Leekley  and  Noyes  ( 1975)  40).  The  territory  of  Aigiale  bordered  on  that  of  Minoa  (no. 573).  In light  of the  limited  archaeological  work  in  the  Amorgian  country- side,  nothing  can  be  said  with  confidence about the e xtent  of  the  territory,  but  it  seems  to  have  been  larger  than  25  km \u00b2.  The  protective  divinity  of  Aigiale  was  Athena  Polias,  who  had  a  sanctuary  where  stelai  were  sometimes erected  (IG xii.7386.42  Syll. \u00b3521  (C 3));  she  is  once  attested  as  sharing  a  sanctuary  with  Zeus  Polieus  (IG xii.7 387.23  (C 3)). 472.

Pae. 4.13\u00ad14;  CID ii  12.ii.66  (C 4s)).  The city-ethnic  is  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.25);  the  dative  plural is  attested  at  SEG 92.51.  Karthaia  is  referred  to as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  the  term  at  Ps.- Skylax 58  (for  MS  ,read ).  It is  called  polis  in the  political  sense  in  several  C 4s  decrees  (IG xii.5528.2\u00ad3,  5; 537.6\u00ad7;  538.6,  dates:  Brun  ( 1989)  126\u00ad28).  The  collective use of  the  city-ethnic  can  be  found  internally  on  Karthaian coins  (infra)  and  decrees  (IG xii.5528.4)  and  externally  in C 4  Athenian  decrees  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.25,  111.54).  The  individual the  aegean  749 and  external  use  is  first attested in a C 3f  proxeny decree  from Delos  (IG xi.4  592.3\u00ad4,  12).  In  C 3,  and  presumably  in  C 4  as well,  the  citizens  were  organised  into  phylai  and  oikoi  (IG xii.5540.15;  see  Jones,  POAG 206). The  eponymous  official was the archon ( IG xii.5544.A1.8, 12  (C 4\u00adC3);  cf.  also  552).  Other  officials attested in Classical sources  are  a  board  of,  probably  three,  strategoi  (IG xii.5 544.A1.15\u00ad19,A2.11\u00ad15,  19\u00ad23)  and  envoys  (presbeis)  sent  to Karystos  (IG xii.5  537.2).  Decrees  were  passed  by  the  boule and  the  demos  on  the  motion  of  an  individual  (IG xii.5  537.1, 528,538  with  add.  (C 4/C3)).Public  enactments  preserved  on inscriptions  include  an  undated  and  rather  obscure  sacred law  (IG xii.5  530)  and  a  regulation  about  a  spring  in  the sanctuary  of  Demeter  of  C 4l  (IG xii.5569).  Public  enact- ments  were  set  up  in  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo  (IG xii.5528.16, 538.12).  Particularly  important  is  a  fragmentary  C 4m  list  of Karthaian  proxenoi  comprising  a  total  of 110  proxenoi  in, probably, 50  different  poleis  (IG xii.5542). The  protective  deity  was  probably  Apollo  (IG xii.5544, found  inter  rudera  templi  Apollinis),  whose  temple  as Pythios  dates  from  about  C 6l  (Mendoni  ( 1985\u00ad86)  163\u00ad65). Public  cults  of  him  (IG xii.5  545  (C 4))  and  Hestia,  or  possi- bly  private,  (IG xii.5  554  (C 5))  are  known before  Alexander. An  official has left a dedication t o  Aphrodite,  which  prob- ably  dates  from  C 4  (IG xii.5552  with  Mitsos  ( 1957)  164  no. 1 and  BE  ( 1962)  264)  and  an  hieron  of  Hermes  is  mentioned  in an  inscription  (IG xii.5  553).  The  temple  of  Athena,  which was  rebuilt  in  C 4  (Mendoni  ( 1990)),  dates  originally  from C 6l  (Mendoni  ( 1985\u00ad86)  161);  see  also  the  construction  his- tory  of  both  temples  in  Papanikolaou  ( 1998).We  hear  also  of a  sanctuary  of  Demeter  (IG xii.5569  (C 4l),  with  Graindor ( 1905)  333\u00ad37);  that  to  Hermes  is  mentioned  in  an  undated inscription  (IG xii.5  553). The  site  of  the  town  has  long  been  known,  on  the  east coast  at  one  of  the  island's  best  anchorages,  with  a  produc- tive  plain  that  stretches  out  at  the  mouth  of  the  river  that flows down off  the  Keian  plateau.  The  town walls  were prob- ably  demolished  by Chabrias  in  364,  but  with  the  Athenians' permission  the  Karthaians  were  thereafter  allowed  to  restore a  rather  slim  defence  circuit,  probably  as  protection  against pirates  (IG ii\u00b2  404  (C 4s),  with  Maier  ( 1959\u00ad61)  no. 37;  cf.  also Maier  ( 1958)).  A  prytaneion  was  present  by C 5  (IG xii.5 1060.2).For  the  temple  of  Apollo,  which  sits  on  a  little  acrop- olis  jutting  out  from  the  surrounding  rock,  see  supra. Karthaia  struck  coins  of  silver  and  bronze  from  C 6s onwards.  Four  series  of  coins  seem  to  belong  to  the  Archaic and  Classical  periods.  ( 1)\u00ad(2)  The  first series seems t o  start c. 510  (or 530  at  the  earliest),  the  second  by  c. 500,  though there  are  problems  with  both  the  attributions  of  the  coins and  the  dates.

The  toponym  appears  variously  as ,  (IG xii.5647.11  (C 3e))  and  (Ps.- Skylax 58;Strabo 10.5.6).  The  only  attestation  of  referring  to the  polis  on  Keos  is  in  a  spurious  letter  (Aeschin. Ep. 1.1).For  the  distinction  between  ()  on Keos and in  Asia  Minor,  see  L.  Robert  ( 1960a)  144\u00ad45. The  city-ethnic  is  (SEG 92.55  (c. 330)).  Koresia  is  referred  to as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  the  term at  Ps.-Skylax  58.  It  is  called  polis  in  the  political sense  in  an  inscription  recording  a  series  of  loans  extended  to the  polis  by\"the  god\",  probably  Apollo:  [ ] (IG xii  suppl. 236;  cf.  SEG 39  873  (C 4);  but  Migeotte ( 1984)  156  n. 32  assigns  this  inscription  possibly  to  Karthaia). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on coins  in  abbreviated  form  (infra)  and  in  inscriptions  (IG ii\u00b2 1128.12),  and  externally  in  inscriptions  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.26;  SEG 9 2.55).  The  earliest  individual  and  external  use  of  the  city- ethnic  is  in  a  C 3  decree  of  Karthaia  (IG xii.5  531). An  Archaic  inscription  in  the  Eretrian  alphabet  has  some- times  been  cited  as  evidence  of  Eretrian  domination  (IG xii.5649;see LSAG 297\u00ad98  with 648  by  lapsus).  Koresia  was a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  In  their  first appearance in the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  262.i.21),  the  Koresians  are recorded  separately  from  the  Keians  (IG i\u00b3  262.v.22);  later they  are  subsumed  under  a  synteleia  (supra 748).In  the  list  of members  of  the  Second  Athenian  League  they  appear  as Keians  along  with  the  Ioulietai  and  the  Karthaians  (IG ii\u00b2 43.B.23\u00ad26).  Koresia  was  undoubtedly  a  member  of  the Keian  Federation,  dissolved  by  the  Athenians  in  362  (IG ii\u00b2 1128  and 404;see supra).  Koresia  was  incorporated  into Ioulis  for  a  while  in  C 4s  (IG xii.5  609.175),  but  was  again  a separate  polis  in  C 3  until  finally c ompletely  absorbed  by Ioulis  (Strabo  10.5.6;Reger ( 1998)).  In  C 4s  Koresia  may  have been  both  a  dependent  polis  and  a  phyle  of  Ioulis.  For  the double  status  as  dependent  polis  and  civic  subdivision  of  a major  polis,  see  Hansen  ( 1997)  37.  But  its  status  as  an  inde- pendent  polis  in  C 3\u00adC2  follows  not  only  from  the  evidence of  its  inscriptions--which c ould  be  compatible  with  a  status 750 reger of  dependent  polis  (IG xii.5647.9;  SEG 14  541;  PEP  Chios 51)--but also from its status as the c hief  station  of  the Ptolemaic  fleet in C 3,  when  it  was  renamed  Arsinoe  and  is attested  operating  as  an  independent  polis  as  late  as  c. 207 (Davis  and  Cherry ( 1991);  L.  Robert  ( 1960a);  I.Magnesia 50). Decrees  were  passed  by  the  boule  and  the  demos  (IG ii\u00b2 1128.9,  where  the  restoration  of  \u00b5  in  l. 9  is  virtual- ly  certain).  Public  enactments  were  set  up  in  the  sanctuary  of Apollo  (ibid.  ll. 15\u00ad16),  which  is  probably  the  sanctuary  of Apollo  Smintheus  attested  by  Strabo  10.5.6.A board of astynomoi  (l. 17)  and  a  dikasterion  (l. 18)  are  known  from  the same  inscription  and  likewise  a  prytaneion  (l. 24). In C 4l  Koresia  seems  to  have  had  some  154  citizens  fit for military  service,  corresponding  to  c. 230  adult  male  citizens and  a  total  population  of  c. 1,200  persons  (IG xii.5  609.175ff) (see  Ruschenbusch  ( 1982);  Cherry,  Davis  and  Mantzourani ( 1991)  236\u00ad37;  Hansen  ( 1997)  28\u00ad29  with  n. 147). The  urban  centre,  located  on  the  hill  above  the  present harbour  town,  has  been  thoroughly  studied  (Cherry,  Davis and  Mantzourani  ( 1991)  265\u00ad81).  Koresia  was  permitted  to restore  its  walls  after  the  revolt  of  the  360s  and  350s  (IG ii\u00b2 404.16  Maier  ( 1959\u00ad61)  no. 37  and  Maier  ( 1958)).  The northern  part  is  preserved,  and  the  circuit  may  have enclosed  an  area  of  c. 18  ha  (Cherry,  Davis  and  Mantzourani ( 1991)  236).  The  countryside  was  full  of  structures  during the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods,  but  most  of  the  popula- tion  lived  in  the  urban  centre  (Cherry,  Davis  and Mantzourani  ( 1991)  327\u00ad47,  esp. 337). Koresia  struck  silver  coins  from  C 6e  to  c. 480.  Three  series of  coins  have  been  assigned  to  Koresia.

The  identifica- tion  and  dating  remain  somewhat  problematic.

The  city\u00adethnic  is (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.83;  IG xi.2199.B.14).

The  collective use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists (supra). Steph.  Byz. 364.3  catalogues  the  island  among  the Kyklades.  The  islands  around  Kasos,  the  (Strabo  10.5.18),  were  part  of  its  territory.  Kasos  was  a  mem- ber  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the  Ionian\u00adKarian district  (IG i\u00b3  283.iii.4)  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists from  434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.ci.11)  to  415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.i.6)  a  total  of six  times,  once  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1,000 dr.  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.83).  The  presence  of  Kasian  theoroi  on  Delos in 274  provides  a  terminus  post  quem  for  the  absorption  of Kasos  by  the  Rhodians  (IG xi.2199.B.14  with  Fraser  and Bean  ( 1954)  152;  Papachristodoulou  ( 1989)  48).  The  urban centre  and  its  harbour  were  connected  by  an  ancient  road (Susini  ( 1963\u00ad64)  206).  A  sanctuary  of  Apollo  Temenitas  is attested  from  the  Hellenistic  period  (I.Cret.  I  xxii 4.C.xii. I. 66\u00ad69;  cf.  Susini  ( 1963\u00ad64)  211).

The  toponym  is  (Bacchyl.  Epin. 6.5; Hdt. 8.76.1)  or  ,  (Ps.-Skylax  58;  IG ii\u00b2  404.6\u00ad7  (C 4s)). The  ethnic  is  (IG xii.5594.7)  or  (CID ii 6.B.10\u00ad26).  Strabo,  quoting  Artemidoros,  places  Keos among  the  Kyklades  (Strabo  10.5.3).  Keos  had  four  poleis (Ps.-Skylax  58: ).  Harpokration  s.v.  quotes  Lysias  (fr. 96,  Sauppe)  for  referring  to  Keos  as  being one  polis:\"   \u00b5  \".  Harpokration notes  the  anomaly  and  takes  polis  to  be  used  synonymously with  nesos:       \u00b5  .But Lysias'  use  of  the  ethnic  instead  of  the  toponym  indicates that  the  reference  is  to  Keos  as  a  kind  of  political  communi- ty (CPCActs 5:  126\u00ad27).  The  individual  use  of  the  ethnic  is attested  internally  in  C 4  decrees  (SEG 14  531.7)  and  external- ly  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (infra)  and  in  the  C 4  lists  of the  Delian  Amphiktyony  (I.D\u00e9los 98.A.12  IG ii\u00b2  1635.113 ( 377/6)).  The  individual  and  external  use  is  attested  in  an Athenian  list  of  crews  of  ships  of 405  (IG i\u00b3  1032.vi.72\u00ad82) and  in  Delphic  inscriptions  (CID ii  4.iii.40  and 6.B.10\u00ad26). In  the  accounts  of  the  Delphian  naopoioi  we find     '  (CID ii  12.i.33)  and        (CID ii 12.i.1)  alongside  the  simple  (CID ii  17),  also  attested  in  a  Delphic  proxeny  decree  of  C 4l  (SEG 31  536).  This  probably  reflects the federation (cf.  Reger  and  Risser  ( 1991) 316\u00ad17). It  is  not  always  easy  to  distinguish  between  the  use  of  the island  ethnic  (IG xii.5594.7  SEG 14  531)  or   (CID ii  6.10\u00ad26)  to  designate  merely  \"a  person  from  Keos\" (without  reference  to his  or  her  polis  of  origin)  and  its  use  to denote  \"a citizen  of  (one  of)  the  Keian  federation(s)\"  of three  of  the  four  poleis  in  C 5  and  C 4  (cf.  Reger  ( 1997)  474  and infra).  \"Keios\"  probably  means  \"from  the  island  of  Keos\",  in Bacchylides  (Epigr. 1.4: ;  17.130: ),  in  the  expres- sion    in  Timokreon  ( 10.1\u00ad2  West  (C 5f)),  and in  the  Parian  Chronicle  mentioning  Simonides  as  a  Keian (IG xii.5  444.70  (FGrHist 239)).  Cf.  also  the  Keians  in  Plato: Simonides,  Prodikos  and  Pythokleides  (Pl.  Hipparch. 228C; Ap. 19E;  Prt. 314C  (all  rC 5)),  as  again  in  the  Athenian  list  of crews  (IG i\u00b3  1032.vi.72\u00ad82)  or  in  the  victor  lists  for  the Olympic,  Nemean  and  Isthmian  Games  (Olympionikai 116 ( 540),  203  ( 480),  288  ( 452)).  But  when  Herodotos  speaks  of the  aegean  747 the  Hestiatorion  of  the  Keians  on  Delos  ( 4.35.4)  (the  build- ing  has  not  been  identified:  see  Bruneau  and  Ducat  ( 1983) 160),  a  building  publicly  dedicated  to  Apollo,  it  is  far  more likely  that  he  wants  his  reader  to  understand  that  a  political body,  \"the  Keians\",  dedicated  it.  Moreover,  Herodotos  has the  Keians  supply  two  ships  at  Artemision  (Hdt. 8.1.2)  and seven  at  Salamis  (Hdt. 8.46.2).  The  Keians  are  recorded  on the  Serpent  Column  commemorating  the  victory  at  Plataiai (ML 27.7),  and  at  Olympia  after  the  Persian  War  (Paus. 5.23.2). The  Keians  were  members  of  the  Delian  League,  and  may have  been  among  the  original  members  (ATL  iii. 198\u00ad99). They  belonged  to  the  Island  district  (IG i\u00b3  270.v.23)  and  are recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  451/50  (IG i\u00b3  262.v.22)  to 416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.13)  a  total  of  thirteen  times,  twice  com- pletely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of  at  first more than  1  tal. (IG i\u00b3  262.v.22),  raised  to  4  tal.  in  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.21), reduced to 3  tal.  in  433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.i.74),  but  raised  again  to  6 tal.  in  417/16  (IG i\u00b3  288.i.10).They  were  assessed  for  tribute  in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.69)  ( 10  tal.)  and  in  410/9  (IG i\u00b3  100.Ii.3). They  are  recorded  among  the  paying  members  in  413  (Thuc. 7.57.4).  Although  the  most  recent  study  of  Keian  coinage assigns  no  coins  with  the  legend  () to before  the end  of  C 4  (Papageorgiadou-Banis  ( 1997)  43;  but  cf.  Sheedy ( 1998b)),  this  need  mean  only  that  a  C 5  federation  did  not issue  coins.  Archaic  coins  minted  by  Ioulis,  Karthaia  and Koresia  have  a  dolphin  alongside  the  individual  type  of  each polis  (infra 749,  750  and 751).  On  balance  the  evidence strongly  suggests,  as  already  argued  by  Brun  ( 1989),  that  the Keian  poleis  created  in  C 5  a  federal  state  of  some  kind  with ties  between  the  participant  poleis  that  reached  beyond merely  joint  payment  of  a  phoros  to Athens. In C 4  under  the  heading  ,  the  Ioulitai,  Karthaieis and  Koresioi  are  listed  individually  as  members  of  the Second  Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43B.23\u00ad26);  the Poiessians  are  recorded  separately  (l. 82).  Two  isopoliteiai agreements  between  the  Keians  and  the  Euboian  cities  of Histiaia  (no. 372)  (SEG 14.531  improved  text  of  IG xii.5 594  Tod 141)  and  Eretria  (no. 370)  (SEG 14  530),  both  of perhaps  c. 364  (cf.  Brun  ( 1989)  124),  show  that  at  least  the three  usual  Keian  poleis  formed  a  federation  again  at  this time:  there  was  a  common  citizenship  for  all  Keians,  and  the citizens  were  subdivided  into  phylai,  trittyes  and  choroi ( ) (Jones,POAG  203\u00ad4).A  common  boule  and  boards of  thesmophylakes,  probouloi  and  astynomoi  are  also  attested. According  to Heracl.  Lemb. 28,  quoting  Aristotle,  the  Keians passed  a  law  (nomos)  forbidding  girls  and  boys  from  drink- ing  wine  (cf.  Villard  ( 1997));  but  he  also  says  ( 26)  that  Keos was  settled  by  one  Keos  from  Naupaktos  (no. 165),  a  story which  may  owe  its  origins  to  Keian  relations  with  that  town in  C 3  (see  IG xii.5527);  otherwise  the  best  ancient  testimony agrees  that  the  Keians  were  Ionians  from  Athens  (Hdt. 8.46; Thuc. 7.57.4;  schol.  Dionys.  Perig. 525,giving  Thersidamas  as the  leader).  Ioulis  seems  to  have  been  the  capital  of  the  fed- eration.  The  Keians  appear  as  debtors  on  Delos  in  377/6 (I.D\u00e9los 98.A.12).  An Aristotelian  Constitution  of  the  Keians is  attested  (Heracl.  Lemb. 26\u00ad29).Lys.fr.96  indicates  that  the federation  was  formed  before  c. 380,and  it  may  go  back  to  411 (D.M.Lewis ( 1962)  3\u00ad4).  The  Keians  defected  from  the Athenian  League  in  364  but  were subdued  by a  squadron under  Chabrias  and  forced  to dissolve the  federation  (IG ii\u00b2 111  Tod 142).  The  injunction  to  remain  as  separate  poleis  is repeated  in  a  decree  of 354\u00ad338  (IG ii\u00b2  404.13\u00ad14  with  Dreher ( 1985)  268;  for  the  date,  see  Hansen  ( 1984)  125  n. 6).Again,  in the  list  of  recipients  of  grain  from  Kyrene  c. 330  (SEG 92), Ioulis,  Koresia  and  Karthaia  are  listed  individually  alongside an  amount  to  the  Keians  as  such  ( 45,  51\u00ad55);  Ruschenbusch ( 1982)  183  argues  that  the  Poiessians  are  inadvertently  omit- ted  after  the  Keians;  contra  Brun ( 1989)  137.  It  has  been  sug- gested  that  IG xii.5  609  was  a  list  of  citizens  of  a  C 4l sympoliteia  between  Ioulis  and  Koresia  (Ruschenbusch ( 1982);  see  still  D.  M.  Lewis  ( 1962)).  Poiessa  seems  never  to have  participated  in  any  of  these  federal  states  (Phylarchos, FHG 1.346;  Brun  ( 1989)  131\u00ad32).  Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 55\u00ad60 argues  that  the  calendars  of  all  four  Keian  poleis  must  have been  identical,  but  the  evidence  to support  this  is  slim. 491.

Cam. 3  D  c  54,  4.b.8  and 11,  109.4\u00ad5;  IG xii.1844.33\u00ad34  (C 1)). Chalke  is  not  called  a  polis  in  any  source,  but  its  membership of  the  Delian  League  (infra)  and  a  C 4m  treaty  concluded with  Knidos  (infra)  strongly  suggest  that  Chalke  was  a  polis in  C 5\u00adC4.  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  280.i.54)  and  in the  inscription  from  Knidos  (I.Knidos 605).  The  individual use  is  attested  internally  (IG xii.1216  (Hell.))  and  externally at  Kameiros  (Tit.  Cam. 3 c 54  (C1l)). Chalke  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Karian  district  (IG i\u00b3  269.iv.6)  and  is  recorded  in  the tribute  lists  from  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.i.10)  to  427/6  or 426/5  (IG i\u00b3  284.19),  a  total  of  seventeen  times,  three  times  completely restored,  paying  a  phoros  of  first  3,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  263.i.10), reduced to 2,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  267.iii.22)  in  445/4  or  possibly already  in  446/5  (IG i\u00b3  266.iii.27,completely  restored).  It  was assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.104,  2,000  dr.). In C 4m  the  Chalkeatai  concluded  what  is  presumably  an isopoliteia  treaty  with  Knidos  (no. 903)  (I.Knidos 605;  cf. Gawantka  ( 1975)  209  no. 11  and 38  n. 79).  The  Knidians granted  the  Chalkeatai  the  right  to  purchase  landed  proper- ty  and  to  participate  in  Knidian  citizenship  (politeia).  The last  preserved  line  of  the  inscription  records  the  beginning of  the  decree  of  the  Chalkeatai  which  presumably  granted the  Knidians  the  same  privileges. By C 4l,  however,  Chalke  had  become  part  of  the  Rhodian state,  for  Theophrastos  calls  it      `  (Hist.  pl. 8.2.9).  More  specifically,  it  was  turned into  a  deme  of  Kameiros  (no. 996)  (Tit.  Cam. 109  (C 4l);  in C 3  lists  of  damiourgoi:  Tit.  Cam. 3 c 54  (C 1l),  4.b.8,  11  (first century  ad)),  although  perhaps  the  process  of  incorporat- ing  its  inhabitants  into  the  political  structure  of  Kameiros had  not  yet  been  completed  by  about  325,  since  the Chalkeatai  are  treated  as  exceptions  in  a  law  of  approximate- ly  that  date  (Tit.  Cam. 109.4\u00ad5). According  to  Strabo  ( 10.5.15),  the  island  had  a  harbour (limen);  its  location  has  been  a  matter  of  dispute  (see  Susini ( 1963\u00ad64)  249).  Strabo  also  mentions  a  sanctuary  of  Apollo, who  may  have  been  the  protective  deity.  A  dedication  to Asklepios  is  known  from  C 4  or  perhaps  C 3  (IG xii.1  956); mention  of  Zeus  and  Hekate  is  likely  to  have  been  late  (IG xii.1958).  The  polis  centre  lay  to  the  north  and  east  of  the modern  settlement,  which  occupies  the  acropolis  with  its  castle  of  the  Knights  of  St  John  (Hope  Simpson  and Lazenby  ( 1973)  156;  Susini  ( 1963\u00ad64)  247).  The  preserved wall  includes  sections  that  have  been  dated  to  C 6,but much of  it  is  undoubtedly  Hellenistic  (Susini  ( 1963\u00ad64)  248).  No coinage  is  known.

Polis  status in  the  Classical  period  is  indicated  by  Astypalaia's  member- ship  of  the  Delian  League  (infra),  and  by  the  C 4  grant  of ateleia  obtained  from  Epidauros  (infra).

According  to Ps.-Skymnos  551,Astypalaia  was  a  colony  of Megara (no. 225),but  a  C 4  inscription  claims  Epidauros  (no. 348)  as  the  metropolis  (IG iv\u00b2.147).Astypalaia  was  a  member of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the  Karian  district  (IG i\u00b3 269.iv.17)  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.14)  to  428/7  (IG i\u00b3  283.ii.29),  a  total  of  thirteen times,  three  times  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 2 tal.

It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.143).  In  C 4s  the Astypalaians  obtained  a  grant  of  ateleia  from  Epidauros  (IG iv\u00b21.47).  Astypalaia  received  grain  from  Kyrene  (no. 1028) c. 330\u00ad326  (Tod 196.47  SEG 9.2.47).

Pausanias  reports  a  sanctuary  of  Athena  in  the  story  he tells  of  the  Olympic  victor  Kleomedes  of  Astypalaia,  who  in 492  killed  his  opponent  wrestling  and  went  mad;  he  pulled down  the  roof  of  a  school  so  that  it  fell  upon  sixty  children, but  he  was  later  made  a  hero  on  the  basis  of  advice  from  the oracle  at  Delphi  (Paus. 6.9.6\u00ad8;  Anth.

Isokrates  describes  Melos  as  a  polichnion  ( 12.98),  per- haps  as  part  of  his  effort  to  minimise  the  atrocities  commit- ted  in  C 5  by  the  Athenians.  The  collective  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on  some  coins  of  C 5  (infra) and  on  an  inscription  of  C 2  (IG xii.3  1097)  and  externally  in inscriptions  (ML  27.7  ( 479);  IG xii.31259  (C 4s)  Tod 179.6; Ager ( 1996)  no. 3;  Magnetto ( 1997)  1\u00ad8  no. 1)  and  in  literary sources  (Thuc. 5.84.3;Dem.  58.56).

Strabo,  quoting  Artemidoros,  places  Melos  among  the Kyklades  ( 10.5.3).  The  Melians  were  allegedly  colonists  from Lakedaimon  (no. 345)  (Hdt. 8.48;  Thuc. 5.84.2;Xen.  Hell. 2.2.3;Diod.  12.65.2;  cf.  Malkin  ( 1994)  74\u00ad76;  Cartledge  ( 2002) 93\u00ad94),  and  the  Melians  believed  themselves  that  this  coloni- sation  took  place 700  years  before  the  Athenian  attack  in 416/15  (Thuc. 5.112.2;  see  Malkin  ( 1994)  74\u00ad77).  A  C 1  histor- ian  reports  that  the  Milesians  (no. 854)  attacked  Melos,  per- haps  in  C 8eorC7  (Konon  (FGrHist 26)fr.  1.44);  perhaps  this event,  if  historical,  should  be  associated  with  the  Parian  and Milesian  struggles  in  the  Archaic  period  (see 765  and 1084 infra).  The  Melians  refused  Persian  demands  to  submit  in 490,  and  supplied  troops  and  two  pentekonters  to  the  war effort  in 480  (Hdt. 8.46.4,  48);  they  are  recorded  on  the Serpent  Column  in  Delphi  (ML 27.7)  and  also  appear  in  the dedication  at  Olympia  (Paus. 5.23.2;  cf.  Hdt. 9.81.1).  The Melians,  however,  did  not  join  the  Delian  League  (Thuc. 2.9.4).  They  are  recorded  as  having  contributed  to  the Spartan  war  fund  (ML 67.1\u00ad7,  13\u00ad17,  with  Loomis  ( 1992), perhaps  in  the  earlier  phases  of  the  Peloponnesian  War,  per- haps  around 410\u00ad405  (so  Pi\u00e9rart  ( 1995)).  At  about  the  same time  the  Athenians  ravaged  the  island  (Thuc. 3.91.1\u00ad3 ( 426/5))  and  soon  thereafter  added  the  Melians  to  the  assess- ment  for 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.65)(15  tal.).  Thucydides'  descrip- tion  of  the  famous  Athenian  siege  of 416/15  shows  Melian troops  active,  often  quite  successfully,  on  the  island  in  oppo- sition  to  the  Athenian  invaders  ( 5.84,  114.1\u00ad2,  115.4,  116.2\u00ad4), but  the  town  was  betrayed,  and  at  defeat  the  Athenians  killed the  adult  male  citizens  and  subjected  the  rest  of  the  popula- tion  to  andropodismos  (Thuc. 5.116.4;  cf.  also  Isoc. 12.63; Andoc. 4.22).  Five  hundred  Athenian  colonists  were  installed in 415  (Thuc. 5.116.4;  see  Figueira  ( 1991)  220).  A  tombstone  of C 5l  probably  commemorates  one  of  the  Melian  traitors  who was  afterwards  rewarded  with  Athenian  citizenship  (IG xii.3 1187).  It  is  to  this  period  that  most  of  our  evidence  about civic  organisation  dates  (see  Jones,  POAG 214\u00ad15).  The Spartans  took  Melos  in 405  from  the  Athenians  and  allowed the  population  to  return  (Xen.  Hell. 2.2.9;Plut.  Lys. 14.4).  In C 4m  Melos  was  a  pirates'  nest,  and  Athens  had  the  Melians fined 10  tal.  for  harbouring  the  pirates  (Dem. 58.56).  Soon after 338  the  Melians  were  involved  in  a  dispute  with  the Kimolians  (no. 496)  over  the  possession  of  the  three  small islands  of  Polyaiga,  Eteireia  and  Libeia.  In  accordance  with  a decision  of  the  synedrion  of  the  League  of  Corinth,  the  dis- pute  was  submitted  to  arbitration  by  Argos  (no. 347),  and the  Argives  decided  in  favour  of  Kimolos  (IG xii.3 1259  Tod 179;Ager  ( 1996)no.  3;Magnetto  ( 1997)  1\u00ad8  no. 1). C. 330,  in  consequence  of  an  offence  committed  by,  among others,  a  Melian  Olympic  victor,  the  Melians,  alongside  a number  of  Peloponnesian  poleis,  paid  damages  to  envoys sent  from  Kyrene  (no. 1028)(SEG  20  716;  for  the  context,  see SEG 39  1717;  for  the  date,  see  SEG 46  2198  p. 636). The  Aristotelian  collection  of  politeiai  seems  to  have included  a  Constitution  of  the  Melians  (fr. 564);  but  we know next  to  nothing  about  the  Melian  political  institutions.  In 416/15  Thucydides  ( 5.84.4\u00ad86)  notes  the  absence  of  a  deci- sion-making  popular  assembly  (  ),combined with the  presence  of  Melian  magistrates  ( )  and  a  council ( ) described as \"the few\"(   ).The presump- tion  is  that  Melos  was  oligarchically  governed;  but  we  cannot tell  whether  that  was  the  normal  situation  or  the  result  of  the Athenian  attack.  The  betrayal  of  Melos  to  the  Athenians  in 416  testifies t o  a  stasis  between  a  pro-Athenian  and  an  anti- Athenian  faction  (Thuc. 5.116.3).  A  Melian  proxenos  has  been restored  in  a  C 4m  inscription  from  Karthaia  (IG xii.5542.30, but  dubiously). The  urban  centre  of  Melos  must  have  been  fortified in 424,  when  the  Athenians  under  Nikias  attacked  the  island (Thuc. 3.91.1\u00ad3,  94.1;Diod.  12.65.3),  but  the  walls  mentioned in  Thucydides'  account  were  built  by  the  Athenians  as  part of  their  operations;  the  isodomic  sections  may  represent repair  and  enhancement  of  a  pre-existing  (C 6l\u00adC5e?)  wall  in Lesbian/polygonal  masonry  (Thuc. 5.114.1,  115.4,  116.2; Cherry and  Sparkes  ( 1982),  with  further  refs.;  Wagstaff  and Cherry ( 1982b)  261).  The  agora  mentioned  by  Thucydides  in the  same  context  ( 5.115.4)  may  actually  refer  not  to  the Melians',  but  to a  military  agora  serving  the  Athenian besiegers.  However,  Melos  did  have  an  agora  in  the  Classical period,  which  has  been  identified archaeologically (Kenzler ( 1999)  112\u00ad13,  with  further  refs.).  A  C 6  inscription  may  attest to  a  cult  of  Athena  (IG xii.31075  with  Pontani  ( 1937);  Jeffery ( 1990)  320).  A  cult  of  Asklepios  has  been  inferred  for  C 4 (Semeria  ( 1986)  954). The  Melian  countryside  appears  to  have  supported  a  con- siderable  number  of  settlements,  some  of  which  may  have been  large  enough  to  be  regarded  as  villages  (Cherry  ( 1982) 18  fig. 2.1,  22  fig. 2.6;  Wagstaff  and  Cherry ( 1982a)  142\u00ad45). Growth  of  the  urban  centre  to  a  maximum  size  of  about  19  ha  during  the  Classical  period  has  been  interpreted  as the  aegean  759 nucleation,  perhaps  in  response  to  the  Athenian  conquest  of 416/15  (so  Snodgrass  ( 1987\u00ad89)  60). In C 6l  (c. 515:  Boutin  ( 1986)  3)  the  Melians  began  to  pro- duce  silver  coins  on  the  Milesian\u00adPhoenician  standard, although  a  stater  on  the  Aiginetan  standard  has  been  attrib- uted  to  the  island  (see  Erxleben  ( 1970)  72).

Aegean  Islands 679\u00ad89).A  hoard  of  about  100  staters  found  on  Melos  in  1907 (IGCH 27)  has  been  argued  to  reflect anxieties about possi- ble  Athenian  attacks  c. 420  (Kraay  ( 1964)). The  Melians  colonised  Kryassos  in  Karia,  an  event  that cannot  be  closely  dated  (Plut.  Mor. 246D\u00adE;  Polyaen. 8.64; cf.  Nigdelis  ( 1990)  199;  Malkin  ( 1994)  76). 506.

The  toponym  is ,  (Hdt. 4.33.2),  denoting  the  island  (Aesch.  Pers. 885),  the  town  (Ps.-Skylax  58)  and  the  political  community (Eupolis  fr. 245,  PCG).  According  to  Arist.  fr. 612,  alternative toponyms  were `  and '.  The  city- ethnic  is  (IG \u00b2ii1635A.20  ( 377/6\u00ad374/3);  Thuc. 8.69.3).  Steph.  Byz. 622.4\u00ad6  records as  a  variant form,  perhaps  attested  in  a  C 4s  inscription  from  Kyrene (SEG 9.2.15: []  Tod 196;cf.SEG  42  1663  and  infra). Tenos  is  implicitly  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ps.- Skylax 58  (Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  142),  and  the Tenians  appear  under  the  heading  polis  used  in  the  political sense  in  the  so-called  Charter  of  the  Second  Athenian  Naval League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.32,  70,  78,B17)  and  in  the  accounts  of  the Delian  amphiktyones  (I.D\u00e9los 98Aa12,Ba4  IG ii\u00b2  1635 ( 377/6\u00ad374/3));  cf.  also  Hdt. 4.33.2.  After  C 4m  the  preposi- tional  group  denotes  one  of  the  phylai  (\u00c9tienne ( 1990)  22),  but  the  noun  is  still  being  used  in  its  usual sense,  denoting  the  political  community  (IG xii.5798.6 (C 3)).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  inter- nally  in  abbreviated  form  on  coins  of  C 4l  (infra)  and  exter- nally  on  the  Serpent  Column  at  Delphi  (ML  27.7),  in  the Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b2  263.iv.19),  on  Delos  (I.D\u00e9los 98A12  ( 377/6))  and  in  Thucydides  ( 7.57.4).  Several  inscrip- tions  of  C 4  give  the  external  individual  ethnic  (IG ii\u00b2  10446; IG xii.5542.45;  I.D\u00e9los 98A20).  Patris  is  found  in  IG ii\u00b2 466b.38  ( 307/6). 776 reger Strabo,  citing  Artemidoros,  places  Tenos  among  the Kyklades  (Strabo  10.5.3).  Tenos  was  settled  by  Ionians  c. 1000 (Lauffer  ( 1989)  655).  The  island  seems  to  have  fallen  under the  control  of  Eretria  (no. 370)  in  C 8;  this  control  would have ended  by c. 650  (Strabo  10.1.10).  The  Persians  captured the  island  in  490  (as  implied  by  Hdt. 6.96\u00ad97;  cf.  Aesch.  Pers. 885).  Tenians  served  in  Xerxes'  fleet at Salamis (Hdt. 8.66.2), but  desertion  to  the  Greek  side  by  one  commander  earned the  Tenians  a  place  on  the  Serpent  Column  at  Delphi  (Hdt. 8.82.1;ML  27.7);  they  appear  also  in  the  dedication  at Olympia  (Paus. 5.23.2). Tenos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League,  and  may  have been  among  the  original  members  (ATL  iii. 198\u00ad99).  It belonged  to  the  Island  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute lists  from  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.19)  to  416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.29)  a total  of  twelve  times,  twice  completely  restored,  paying  a phoros  of  first  3  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.19),  reduced  to  2  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 271.i.89)  in  or  before  443/2  (IG i\u00b3  269.v.15).  It  was  assessed for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.73)  of 10  tal.  They  were still paying  members  in  413,  and  naval  forces,  probably  with marines,  participated  in  the  Sicilian  expedition  (Thuc. 7.57.4).  In  411  a  contingent  of  soldiers  from  Tenos  supported the  Four  Hundred  in  Athens  (Thuc. 8.69.3),  and  from  this Gehrke,  Stasis 159  infers  that  Tenos  must  have been  one  of the  poleis  in  which  the  constitution  was  changed  from  a democracy  to  an  oligarchy  after  the  oligarchic  revolution  in Athens  (cf.  Thuc. 8.64.1). The  Tenians  joined  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League  in the 370s  (IG ii\u00b2  43B.17);  one,  Bion,  served  as  Tenian  envoy  to Athens  (no. 361)  in  connection  with  League  business c. 370\u00ad340  (IG ii\u00b2  279  with  D.  M.  Lewis  ( 1954)  50).Other  Tenian envoys  to  Athens  are  mentioned  in  a  later  inscription  in  which Tenians  residing  in  Attika  were  awarded  isoteleia  in  C 4s  (IG ii\u00b2 660  with  Pecirka ( 1966)  93\u00ad95).  Tenos  was  subjected  in  362  to andrapodismos  by  Alexander  of  Pherai  (Dem. 50.4).  The  relo- cation  of  the  town  in  C 4m  (infra)  and  the  reorganisation  of the  civic  subdivisions  were  probably  caused  by  the andrapodismos  and  carried  out  in  connection  with  a  repopu- lation  of  the  island  (\u00c9tienne  ( 1984)  211).  If [...]  at  SEG 9 2.15  refers  to  Tenos,  the  Tenians  received  20,000  medimnoi  of grain  from  Kyrene  (no. 1028)  during  the  grain  crisis  of 330\u00ad326 (see  SEG 92  1663;  Gasperini  ( 1996)  103  improperly  corrects  the text  to  read  [];  Brun  ( 1993b)  187\u00ad88  rejects  both restorations  and  prefers  to leave the  text  unemended;  but, given  the  multiple  odd  ethnics  in  this  inscription,  it  would  not be  surprising  if  the  Kyrenaians  simply  got  it  wrong). Pace  Hiller  von  Gaertringen  (IG xii.5  xxiii, 1516)  and Gigon  (no. 138),there  is  no  evidence  to support  the  view  that the  Aristotelian  collection  of  politeiai  included  a  constitu- tion  of  the  Tenians.  The  eponymous  official was the archon (IG xii.5  872.1);  the  theory  that  the  office lasted only six months  rather  than  a  year  is  to  be  rejected  (Gauthier  ( 1992) against  \u00c9tienne  ( 1990)  42\u00ad45).  Prytaneis  are  restored  in  an Athenian  decree  of  C 4m  (IG ii\u00b2  279.2\u00ad3;  cf.  D.  M.  Lewis ( 1954)  50;Pecirka (1966)  53\u00ad54).  Astynomoi  appear  in  the register  of  sales  of  land  of  C 4e  (IG xii.5  872.1).  Citizens  from Tenos  were  appointed  proxenoi  by  Karthaia  (no. 492)  (IG xii.5542.45  (C 4m))  and  by  Chios  (no. 840)  (PEP  Chios 50 (C 4)). The  Tenian  citizens  were subdivided  into,  presumably, ten  territorial  phylai.  These  tribes  may  have  been  created  or reorganised  as  part  of  a  large-scale  civic  reform  of  C 4m  in which  the  moving  of  the  urban  centre  was  an  important  ele- ment  (\u00c9tienne  ( 1990)  45\u00ad47).The  names  of  Tenian  tribes  are attested  epigraphically,  typically  in  the  form  of  phyletics added  to  name  and  patronymic;  all  are  known  from  the large  register  of  sales  of  land  of  C 4l  (IG xii.5  872);  after  each one  listed  below,  only  additional  references  to  earlier  attes- tations  are  noted: () (873.9,12  (C 4s),  875.17  (C 4s)); () (873.9  (C 4s)); '() (875.31  (C 4s)); '() (873.3  (C 4s),  875.15  (C 4s)); ` ( 876.4  (C 4l?)); ( 875.9,  16  (C 4s)); ( 876.1 (C 4l?)); `  ( 875.30  (C 4s)); \u00b5  ( 872.109 (C 4l)); ( 872,  875.8  (C 4s)).  The  name  of  an \"eleventh\"  tribe, ,  seems  to be  a  false  reading  (\u00c9ti- enne  ( 1990)  46).  The  tribe  called  refers  to Tenians  registered  in  the  former  polis  site  at  Xombourgo (see  supra)  and  probably  embraced  the  majority  of  the inhabitants  of  the  new  asty  on  the  seashore  (so  \u00c9tienne ( 1990)  22). Inhabitants  were  registered  in  one  of  at  least  eleven  tonoi, neighbourhoods,  of  the  asty  (IG xii.5  872.6,  21,  25,  36,  44,  72, 123  with  \u00c9tienne  ( 1990)  22\u00ad23).  As  many  as  twenty-three toponyms  are  attested,  mostly  in  the  large  register  of  sales  of land  (IG xii.5  872);  their  locations  throughout  the  island have  been  debated  (\u00c9tienne  ( 1990)  24\u00ad30;  Psarras  ( 1994)). The  Thryesioi  were  probably  located  in  the  central  part  of the  island  at  modern  Komi,  persuasively  identified w ith  the \u00b5  recorded in IG xii.5  872.19  (\u00c9tienne  ( 1990)  29).  From the  toponym  it  can  be  inferred  that  ancient  Kome  was  a  vil- lage.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any  other  nucleated  settlement on  Tenos. A  different  gentilician  civic  subdivision  was  into  . By  contrast  with  the  phylai,  the  patrai  may  be  seen  as  an  aristocratic  holdover:  the  law  of  introduction, \u00b5 ,  which  very  likely  regulates  induction  into  the the  aegean  777 patrai,  insists  on  legitimacy  through  the  male  line  and  sets an  age  restriction  of  at  least  50  years  (IG xii  suppl. 303  with \u00c9tienne  ( 1990)  40\u00ad42  no. 2).  A  decree  of  the  patra  of  the Androkleidai  survives  (\u00c9tienne  ( 1990)  37\u00ad39  no. 1 (C 4e\u00adC3s)). The  huge  register  of  sales  of  land  (IG xii.5  872)  and  a  few small  related  inscriptions  ( 873\u00ad79)  provide  us  with  valuable information  about  ownership  of  landed  property,  inherit- ance  and  size  of  families  (often  more  than  two  adult  chil- dren  in  a  family);  see  the  analysis  in  \u00c9tienne  ( 1990)  51\u00ad84. The  protective  deities  were  Poseidon  and  Amphytrite, whose  sanctuary  lay  on  the  sea  2.5  km  west  of  the  post-C 4m urban  centre  (see  infra).  There  was  probably  a  cult  and  a sanctuary  of  Demeter  Thesmophoros  from  c. 700  (see  infra). An  inscription  of  C 4m  attests  to  a  cult  of  Ge,  possibly  private only  (Despinis  ( 1979)  228\u00ad29). The  Tenian  calendar  is  known  most  completely  through IG xii.5  872.  The  names  of  nine  months  are  given.  Some  are identical  with  the  Athenian  months,  but  apart  from  Tenos, ( 872.15)  is  attested  only  in  Dorian  and  north- western  poleis  (\u00c9tienne  ( 1990)  47\u00ad50;  Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 60\u00ad63). The  urban  centre  of  Tenos  in  the  Archaic  and  most  of the  Classical  periods  was  located  at  Xombourgo  above  the modern  town  (not  in  Barr.).  This  site  was  walled  by  C 7  or later,  and  had  a  sanctuary  in  use  from  C 8e  which  has  been plausibly  assigned  to  Demeter  Thesmophoros  (see Themelis  ( 1976)  4\u00ad23  for  good  overall  plans  and  a  summa- ry  of  the  excavations,  which  were  never  published  as  an ensemble;  his  interpretations,  however,  are  to  be  rejected (Boardman  ( 1978))).  Some  time  around  or  after  C 4m,  this centre  was  abandoned,  and  the  urban  centre  of  the  polis was  transferred  to  its  present  site  by  the  sea.  In  Tenian sources,  this  new  urban  centre  is  usually  referred  to  as  the asty  (IG xii.5  872.21  et  passim;  I.D\u00e9los 104\u00ad32.4  ( 320s?);  cf. \u00c9tienne  ( 1984),  ( 1990)  15\u00ad24).  The  new  asty  was  equipped with  massive  fortification  walls  dated  to  C 4s  (see  the detailed  description  of  Graindor  ( 1910)  236\u00ad42,  with  cor- rections  and  commentary  by  \u00c9tienne  ( 1990)  15\u00ad18);  the walls  are  mentioned  in  an  inscription  of  C 1  (IG xii  suppl. 315  with  \u00c9tienne  ( 1990)  139)  and  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 10  ha (\u00c9tienne  ( 1990)  17  with  plate  II).  The  main  sanctuary  of  the chief  deities  Poseidon  and  Amphytrite  was  located 2.5  km west  of  the  new  urban  centre  on  the  sea;  started  in  C 4mor after,  the  sanctuary  and  the  asty  form  part  of  a  coherent plan  to  reconfigure  Tenian  urban  and  sacred  space  (\u00c9ti- enne  and  Braun  ( 1986)).  Philoch.  fr. 175  claims  that Poseidon  was  honoured  there  as  a  doctor. The  Tenians  began  striking  anepigraphic  silver  coins  on the  Aiginetan  standard  from  c. 600  to c. 500.Denominations: staters  (rare),  hemidrachms  and  triobols.  Types:  obv.  bunch of  grapes;  rev.  incuse  square  (Head,  HN \u00b2492\u00ad93;  Artemis- Gyselen  ( 1977)).

The  city-ethnic  is (IGxii.82.8).Myr ina  is  called  a  polis  in  the  polit- ical  sense  by  Hypereides  at  2.18,  and  in  the  urban  and  politi- cal  senses  combined  by Dionysios  of  Chalkis  (FGH iv  393  fr. 2  (C 4?)).  The  collective  use  of  the  ethnic  is  attested  internal- ly  in  a  proxeny  decree  of  c. 400  (IG xii.82)  and  externally  in the  ATL  (IG i\u00b3  267.iv.30).  The  only  attestation  of  the  indi- vidual  use  is  in  a  sepulchral  inscription  of  C 2: (IG ii\u00b2  9975). As  an  Athenian  dependency  Myrina  is  called  [ \u00b5   ] []  [  ]     (IG xii.84.1\u00ad2  (C 4m); cf.  Cargill  ( 1995)  13).  In  IG xii.82 \u00b5  (ll. 2\u00ad3,  usually  dated  404\u00ad394/3;  see  also  IG xii.87.19  (C 4l)) granting  a  citizen  of  Akrothooi  (no. 560)  proxenia  with ateleia;  the  standard  view,  that  this  represents  a  briefly inde- pendent  Myrina,  has  been  rejected  by  Salomon  ( 1997) 63\u00ad66.  In  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  Myrina  is  listed  as (IG i\u00b3  267.iv.30,  etc.).  All  attestations  of  civic subdivisions  copy  Athens:  citizens  were  organised  into  the Kleisthenic  phylai  and  demoi  (IG xii.85  (C 4m);  IG i\u00b3  1164 (C 5m)).  Both  when  the  Myrinaians  were  part  of  the Athenian  state  (IG xii.83\u00ad5  (C 4m))  and  when  they  were independent  (IG xii.82  (c. 400)  and  7  (c. 318\u00ad307)),  decrees were  proposed  and  carried  by  the  boule  and  the  demos presided  over  by an  epistates  (IG xii.85.5). The  Athenian  siege  of  Myrina  c. 500  implies  city  walls (Hdt. 6.140.2).  We  hear  of  walls  again  in  307/6  (IG ii\u00b2  550;  cf. Maier  ( 1959\u00ad61)  no. 54).  The  urban  centre  which  covered  an area  of  c. 25  ha  lay  on  a  peninsula  outside  modern  Kastro. There  are  remains  of  an  older  acropolis  wall  in  polygonal masonry;  and  the  settlement  was  cut  off  from  the  island  by  a younger  wall  across  the  neck  of  the  peninsula  (Fredrich ( 1906a)  243\u00ad47;  Sealey  ( 1918\u00ad19)  159\u00ad60;  cf.  Lang  ( 1996) 249).  There  were  two  sanctuaries  of  Artemis:  one  on  the acropolis  attested  by  remains  (Fredrich  ( 1906a)  246;  see  also Sealy  ( 1918\u00ad19)  160\u00ad61)  and  boundary  horoi  (Segre ( 1932\u00ad33) 297\u00ad98  no. 5).An  extra-mural  sanctuary  to  Athena,  probably as  Selene,  is  attested  by  archaeological  evidence  from  the Archaic  period  (Fredrich  ( 1906a)  244, 246,  identifying  the archaeological  remains  as  a  temple  associated  with  the  Great Goddess;  Archontidou-Arghyri  ( 1994)  53;  BCH 122  ( 1998) 912\u00ad13)  and  by  horoi  (Segre ( 1932\u00ad33)  294\u00ad97  no. 4  with Jeffery  ( 1990)  299;  SEG 45  1192,  40  745);  archaeological  evi- dence  places  its  start  in  the  Archaic  period  (Archontidou- Arghyri  ( 1994);  BCH 122  ( 1998)  912\u00ad13).  Many  decrees  have been  discovered  at  this  sanctuary,  which  may  well  have  been the  Myrinaians'  state  archive  and  the  goddess  the  protective deity  (so  Parker  ( 1993);  on  Athena  Lemnia,  see  further Steinhart  ( 2000)).  Generally,  see  Archontidou-Arghyri ( 1994).  A  community  of  Chalkideans  living  in  Myrina passed  a  decree  honouring  the  Athenian  epimeletes  (IG xii.8 4  (after  348:see SEG 45  1182)).

The  toponym  is  (IG i\u00b3  1454.35\u00ad37:  [    ]   ~ [],  probably  referring  to a  site  on  Karpathos and  not  to  the  island  as  a  whole,  c. 445\u00ad430,  see  now  Alfieri Tonini  ( 1999).  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  1454.5), recorded  in,  e.g.,  the  Athenian  tribute  list  of 428/7  (IG i\u00b3 283.iii.5)  alongside  the  Eteokarpathians  ( iii.1)  and  Arkeseia on  Karpathos  ( iii.2\u00ad3),  which  \"implies  a  geographical  unit less  than  the  entire  island  for  alone\"  (ATL  i. 497).  It  follows  that  Karpathos  is  one  of  the  three  poleis referred to by tripolis  at  Ps.-Skylax  99  and  thus  attested  as  a polis  in  the  urban  sense  of  the  term.  The  external  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  collectively  in  the  Athenian  tribute lists  (IG i\u00b3  269.iv.19)  and  individually  in  an  Athenian  hon- orific decree ( IG i\u00b3  1454.5).  Karpathos  was  a  member  of  the Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the  Karian  district  (IG i\u00b3 269.IV.19)  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  445/4  (IG i\u00b3  267.iii.23)  to  415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.i.5)  a  total  of  nine  times, twice  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3 267.iii.23),  raised  to  1,500  dr.  in  or  before  415/14  (IG i\u00b3 290.i.5).  The  urban  centre  of  the  Karpathioi  remains unidentified (Hope S impson  and  Lazenby  ( 1962)  164\u00ad65 suggests  a  site  near  modern  Aperi,  but  see  Susini  ( 1963\u00ad64) 232\u00ad33).  A  stater  attributed  to  Karpathos  was  found  in  a hoard  dated  to  c. 375  (IGCH 1790). In,  probably,  the  territory of  Karpathos,  at  modern Pegadi,  are  the  remains  of  \"a  sizeable  classical  town  ...con- vincingly  identified w ith  Potidaion\"  (Hope  Simpson  and Lazenby  ( 1962)  159).  The  toponym  is  ,   (I.Lindos  p. 1009,l.  25  (Maier  ( 1959\u00ad61)  i. 188\u00ad91  no. 50) (C 2m);    in  Ptol.  Geog. 5.2.33).The  ethnic  is (I.  Lindos  p. 1009,ll.  31\u00ad32  (Maier  ( 1959\u00ad61)  i. 188\u00ad91  no. 50),  C 2m).  Our  written  sources  for  this  place  are all  post-Classical  and  refer  to  the  of  the  Potidaieis 746 reger when  it  was  part  of  the  Rhodian  state.  Because  Potidaion does  not  appear  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists,  it  has  been taken  to  be  the  polis  centre  of  the  Eteokarpathioi  (Head, HN \u00b2631;  but  see  infra).  Others  have  seen  it  as  the  port (epineion)  of  the  Karpathioi  (so  Hiller  von  Gaertringen  in IG xii.1  p. 158,  followed  by  Hope  Simpson  and  Lazenby ( 1962)  159).  But  given  the  lateness  of  our  sources,  it  is  diffi- cult  to  be  confident that this entity e xisted  before  the Hellenistic  period,  and  in  any  case  it  is  not  needed  to  make up  the  number  of  poleis  attested  by  Ps.-Skylax.  Perhaps  the best  solution  is  to  connect  it,  as  Hiller  von  Gaertringen  does, with  the  Karpathioi,  who  otherwise  have  no  obvious  civic centre,  and  who--if  they  reappear  as  the  Rhodian  deme  of the in  the  Hellenistic  period,  as  seems very  likely--are closely associated in our epigraphical e vid- ence  with  the  ktoina  of  the  Potidaieis  (see,  e.g.,  I.  Lindos  p. 1009;  Susini  ( 1963\u00ad64)  231).  The  acropolis  of  Potidaion  has walls  that  have  been  attributed  to  C 4,  and  it  has  yielded  pot- tery  of  Classical  date  (Melas  ( 1991)  M\u00ad 25). The  coins  long  attributed  to  this  city  (silver  staters  with obv.  three  dolphins;  rev.  incuse  square)  in  fact  belong  else- where  (Cahn  ( 1957),  and  already  Hiller  von  Gaertringen  in IG xii.1  p. 158).  The  Elmali  hoard,  which  was  buried  in  C 5m, is  said  to  contain  a  Karpathian  coin  (Figueira  ( 1998)  578). 490. ", "Paros": "Identifier: 338, (Parios) Map  61.

Paros  is  called  a  polis  both  in the  urban  sense  (Hdt. 6.134.2;Isoc.  19.19;Ephor.  fr. 63; Matthaiou  and  Kouragios  ( 1992\u00ad98)  438\u00ad40  (C 4s))  and  in the  political  sense  (IG xii.5  110.6,  111.6  (both  C 4e); Matthaiou  ( 1992\u00ad98b)  430\u00ad31  no. 3  (both  C 4m);  Archil.  fr. 13.2).  The  territorial  sense  is  possibly  attested  in  Archil.  fr. 204.  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internal- ly  in  inscriptions  (IG xii.5  110.6,  111.6  (both  C 4e))  and  in abbreviated  form  on  coins  (infra),  and  externally  in  inscrip- tions  (SEG 27  249  (C 6l/C5e);  IG i\u00b3  263.iv.24;  I.D\u00e9los 98B.5 ( 377/6))  and  in  literary  sources  (Hdt. 6.133.1\u00ad2;  Pl.

Strabo,  citing  Artemidoros,  places  Paros  among  the Kyklades  (Strabo  10.5.3).Apart  from  the  urban  centre,  Paros had  many  habitation  sites  in  the  Geometric  and  Archaic periods,  and  it  remains  unclear  what  relation  they  had  to  the main  town  centre  of  Archaic  and  later  periods  and  to  the formation  of  Paros  as  a  unified polity.  These  settlements include  ( 1)  a  fortified habitation site at N aoussa  in  the north-east  quadrant  of  the  island  (Rubensohn  ( 1901) 163\u00ad70,(1949)  1791;  cf.  also  BCH 114  ( 1990)  818,  not  in  Barr.); ( 2)  an  Archaic  fortified site w ith  a  building  identified b y  the excavator  as  a  \"temple\"  at  Oikonomos  (Schilardi  ( 1973), ( 1975b)  93);  ( 3)  the  Archaic  \"acropolis\"  at  Koukounaries (Berranger  ( 1992)  121;Reger ( 1997)  460),  which  has  recently been  claimed  as  a  full-blown  polis  with  Athena  as  its  tutelary deity  (Schilardi  ( 1996));  ( 4) `  (perhaps  to  be  located  at Marmara:  Berranger  ( 1992)  126;  Rubensohn  ( 1949)  1791, misprinted  as  Hydria  in  Barr.;  ( 5)  Myrsineai  (IG xii.5244) was  perhaps  a  civic  subdivision  of  the  Archaic  period  (infra) and  seems  well  fixed b y  modern  Piskopiana  (Rubensohn ( 1901)  175\u00ad76;  Berranger  ( 1992)  132);  ( 6)  at  Dryos,  recorded in  Barr.  conventionally  as  a  settlement,  perhaps  of  the Classical  period,  have  been  reported  a  tower  and  harbour fittings (Rubensohn ( 1901)  173\u00ad74,(1949)  1791).  ( 7)\u00ad(8)  We have  from  later  periods  names  for  a  number  of  settlements on  Paros;  most  of  these  are  located  only  with  some  uncer- tainty,  and  none  seems  associated  clearly  with  any  of  the  set- tlements  known  archaeologically.  They  include   (Steph.  Byz. 434.6;  Rubensohn  ( 1901)  158),  and  \u00b5 (IG xii.5  116  (C 4)),  both  unlocated. Paros  was  said  to  have  been  colonised  by  Arkadia,  with Paros  as  the  oecist  (Heracl.  Lemb.  fr. 25,  from  the Aristotelian  Constitution  of  the  Parians).  The  Athenians  call the  Parians  their  apoikoi  in 373/2  (SEG 31  67.6). From  a  study  of  the  fragments  of  the  poetry  of Archilochos,  Lanzillotta  has  concluded  that  Paros  was  ruled by  an  aristocracy  controlled  by  a  few  families  in  the  Archaic period  (Lanzillotta  ( 1987)  58\u00ad61;  see  also  Berranger  ( 1992) 328\u00ad31).  It  may  be  doubted  that  Paros  was  actually  under  the control  of  Naxos  (no. 507)  in  499  (as  at  Hdt. 5.31.2;  cf. Lanzillotta  ( 1987)  105\u00ad6).  During  the  Archaic  period  the 764 reger Parians  and  the  Naxians  fought  a  series  of  wars  which  imply naval  and  land  forces  (cf.  Berranger  ( 1992)  205\u00ad7).It  is  in  this context  that  a  Milesian  ambassador  is  said  to  have  been  res- cued  from  a  shipwreck  by  a  dolphin  (IG xii.5445.10\u00ad19). C. 655\u00ad650  the  Parians  participated  in  arbitrating  a  dispute between  Chalkis  (no. 365)  and  Andros  (no. 475)over Akanthos  (no. 559)  (Plut.  Mor. 298A\u00adB;  Piccirilli  ( 1973)  7\u00ad11 no. 2).  C. 525  the  Milesians  (no. 854)  requested  Parian  \"state- reformers\"  ( ) to  settle  an  internal  dispute (Hdt. 5.28\u00ad29).  Paros  was  subdued  by  Persia  during  the reign  of  Dareios  (Aesch.  Pers. 882).  The  Parians  sent  a trireme  to  Marathon  with  the  Persian  expedition  in  490 (Hdt. 6.133.1).  In  489  Miltiades  launched  an  expedition against  the  Parians,  which  failed  (Hdt. 6.132\u00ad36;  for  a  differ- ent  tradition,  see  Ephor.  fr. 63).  The  Parians  remained  loyal to  the  Persians  for  the  next  decade  (cf.  Hdt. 8.67.1  with Lanzillotta  ( 1987)  113  and  Berranger-Auserve  ( 2000)  88). After  the  battle  of  Salamis,  Themistokles  led  another Athenian  expedition  against  the  Parians,  who  deterred  him with  a  bribe  (Hdt. 8.112).  Soon  thereafter  they  joined  the Delian  League  (ATL  iii. 190,  198).  Paros  belonged  to  the Island  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  450/49 (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.24)  to  416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.24)  a  total  of  eleven times,  four  times  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 16 tal., 1,200  dr.  in  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.24),  raised  to  18  tal.  in 446/5  (IG i\u00b3  266.iv.25).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4 (IG i\u00b3  71.i.62)  ( 30  tal.).  The  nature  of  the  regime  for  most  of C 5  is  unknown (Berranger-Auserve  ( 2000)  93),  though there  was  an  oligarchy  in  the  polis  in 410/9  abolished  by Theramenes  when,  supporting  the  demos,  he  restored democracy  and  imposed  heavy  fines on the oligarchs (Diod. 13.47.8).  Probably  soon  after  407  the  Parians  helped  effect  a reconciliation  between  the  Thasians  (no. 526)  and  the Neapolitans  (no. 634)  (IG xii.5109  with  Pouilloux  ( 1954) 178\u00ad92;  Piccirilli  ( 1973)  144\u00ad49  no. 33;  Berranger-Auserve ( 2000)  94\u00ad95);  a  bas-relief  found  at  Delphi  depicts  the  rec- onciliation  (Moretti  ( 1953)).  In  C 4e  Paros  came  under  the control  of  one  Pasinos  (Isoc. 19.18),  and  for  a  few  years  Paros was  probably  a  tyranny  or  a  narrow  oligarchy  (Gehrke,  Stasis 125);  but  democracy  was  soon  reintroduced:  Plato  (Menex. 245B)  speaks  of  the  Athenians  fighting \" on  behalf  of  the Parians\"  after  the  reconstruction  of  the  long  walls,  probably c. 393;  and  shortly  afterwards  the  Parians  borrowed  money from  Apollo  of  Delos  under  the  amphiktyony  created  by  the Athenians  (e.g.  I.D\u00e9los 97.13  IG ii\u00b2  1634  ( 391/0)).  That  the Parians  thereafter  had  a  democratic  government  along Athenian  lines  is  suggested  most  recently  by  the  discovery  of part  of  a  kleroterion  of  Athenian  style  on  the  island,  though the  machine  cannot  be  dated  more  closely  than  C 4\u00adC2 (M\u00fcller  ( 1998)).  The  Parians  joined  the  Second  Athenian Naval  League  in  377/6  (IG ii\u00b2  43.A.89).  An  important inscription  of 373/2,  a  rare  example  of  a  decision  of  the synedrion  of  the  League,  has  recently  been  interpreted  as  an effort  by the  League,  through  the  appointment  of  diallagai, to  resolve  bitter  internal  political  factionalism  among  the Parians  (SEG 31  67  with  now  Dreher  ( 1995)  109\u00ad54;  cf.  also Matthaiou  ( 1992\u00ad98b)  435  n. 24).  A  Parian-Thasian  sympo- liteia  should  not  be  inferred,  as  some  have,  from  the  singular of  demos  in  the  phrase  [ ]  \u00b5[]  [ \u00b5][]    in  an  inscription  of  roughly  350\u00ad330  (IG xii.5 114.10\u00ad12  with  p. 308  and  IG xii  suppl.  p. 105;  L.

The  Parians  awarded  the Athenian  boule  a  crown  in  348/7  (IG ii\u00b2  1441.5\u00ad7).  The Parians  received  10,000  medimnoi  of  grain  from  Kyrene  (no. 1028)  c. 330  (SEG 92.29  Tod 196;  cf.  Marasco  ( 1992)). The  Aristotelian  collection  of  politeiai  included  a Constitution  of  the  Parians  (Heracl.  Lemb. 25).  In  C 4 decrees  were passed  by the  boule  and  the  demos.  They  were published  by  the  prytaneis  (IG xii.5  110.10)  or  the  gramma- teus  (IG xii.5  118.5)  at  the  expense  of  a  tamias  (Matthaiou ( 1992\u00ad98b)  430\u00ad31  no. 3.10,  24).  The  eponymous  official was the  archon  (IG xii.5  112.6\u00ad7  Migeotte  ( 1984)  213\u00ad15  no. 61 (C 4))  from  no  later  than  the  lifetime  of  Archilochos  (IG xii.5445.8\u00ad9).  Other  attested  officials are theoroi  and  a neokoros  (IG xii.5108  LSCG 205\u00ad6  no. 111  (C 5)),  theo- propoi  (Hdt. 6.135.2)  and  a  hypostrategos  (IG xii.51019A (C 4\u00adC3?)),although  we  must  wait  till  C 3  to  hear  of  the  strat- egoi  themselves,  here  of  course  a  political,  not  military,  office (IG xii.5  220).  Archilochos  does  mention,  however,  a  milit- ary  strategos  in  C 7  (Archil.  fr. 114.1;  cf. 95.1).  Parian  envoys  to Athens  (no. 361)  are  mentioned  in  the  Naval  Synedrion's decree  of 372  (SEG 31  67.13\u00ad14).  Paros  granted  proxenia  to citizens  of  Chios  (no. 840)  (IG xii.5  110\u00ad11  (C 4e))  and Athens  (IG xii.5114 p. 308;  SEG 48  1135  (all  C 4m)),  and Parians  received  proxenia  from  Anaphe  (no. 474)  (IG xii.3 251.15\u00ad17  (C 4?)). Several  Parian  public  enactments  are  preserved  on inscriptions.  They  include  a  law  of 475\u00ad450  forbidding throwing  rubbish  in  a  public  road  (IG xii.5107  LSCG 202\u00ad3  no. 108;Koerner ( 1993)  215\u00ad17  no. 57  and  SEG 45  1142 for  the  date),  a  law  of  C 5  forbidding  cutting  something, perhaps  sacred  trees  (IG xii.5108  LSCG 205\u00ad6  no. 111; the  aegean  765 Koerner  ( 1993)  217\u00ad19  no. 58),  a  C 5  horos  of  (Zeus?)  Hypatos forbidding  access(?)  to  the  uninitiated  and  to  women  (IG xii.5183  LSCG 203  no. 109  (C 5),  with,  however,  the  reser- vations  of  Berranger  ( 1992)  327),  and  what  may  be  a  law  of c. 450  forbidding  foreigners  from  participating  in  a  cult  (IG xii.5225  LSCG 204\u00ad5  no. 110,with  the  differing  interpreta- tions  of  Berranger  ( 1992)  93\u00ad95  and  Butz  ( 1996)  82\u00ad86).  The Parian  state  owned  public  land  (IG xii.5  115  (C 5)). The  civic  organisation  of  Paros  into  demes  has  been inferred  from  the  appearance  of    on a  vase  in  the  Bosco  Reale  treasure  (Rubensohn  ( 1949)  1807). In  an  inscription  of  the  Roman  period  is  attest- ed  as  the  name  of  a  village  on  Paros  (IG xii.5244;  cf.  SEG 28 709),  and  combining  the  two  sources,  it  has  been  inferred that  Myrrhineai  must  be  the  name  of  a  Parian  civic  subdivi- sion,  possibly  a  deme  (Berranger  ( 1989\u00ad90)).  Patrai  are attested  in  a  C 4  dedication  by  the  Dordopes  to  their Archegetes (SEG 33  687;  pace  Lanzillotta  ( 1987)  191\u00ad94). Only  one  month  of  the  Parian  calendar,  Anthesterion,  is attested  before  300  (IG xii.5  112.7  Migeotte  ( 1984)  no. 61 (C 4));  for  the  four  months  attested  later  and  a  possible reconstruction,  see  Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 65\u00ad72. The  protective  deity  was  Athena  Poliouchos  (IG xii.5 134.17  (C 4\u00adC3);  the  restoration  of  her  epithet  at  1029.5  is  very likely  because  of  the  stoichedon  arrangement,  but  cf. Berranger  ( 1992)  72\u00ad73,187),who  helped  the  Parians  in  C 7  in battle  (Archil.  fr. 94).  Temple  A  (c. 530\u00ad520)  on  the  Parian acropolis,  where  cult  is  attested  from  C 7,may be hers (Gruben  ( 1982b)  221,229  with  Rubensohn  ( 1949)  1842;  reser- vations:  Berranger  ( 1992)  71\u00ad73).  Athena  is  also  Kynthie  (IG xii.5210;  cf.  Berranger  ( 1992)  266\u00ad67  no. 4,  with  a  date  of 525\u00ad500)  and  Pontie  (SEG 28  707  (C 4)).  Demeter  was  wor- shipped  from  C 7  on  Paros  (Hymn.  Hom.  Dem. 491;  see  also Archil.  frr. 169  and 322)  and  her  Thesmophorion,  still  unlo- cated  (Berranger  ( 1992)  85\u00ad90),  played  an  important  role  in a  story  in  Herodotos  ( 6.134.2);  her  priests  seem  to  have  been called (Hsch. 8,  but  see  Hemberg  ( 1950) 171\u00ad72).  Zeus  is  attested  under  multiple  epithets:  Aigiochos (IG xii.5215.6  (C 5e);  Berranger  ( 1992)  267\u00ad69  no. 6), Elasteros  (IG xii.51027  (c. 500),  as  restored  by Berranger ( 1992)  278\u00ad80  no. 13;  IG xii  suppl. 208;  BE  ( 1963)  199; Matthaiou  ( 1992\u00ad98b)  424\u00ad26  no. 1  (an  altar  with  inscrip- tion  dated  to  C 6l)  and  426\u00ad30  nos. 2\u00ad3  (which  may  be  horoi of  his  sanctuary,  see  also  Matthaiou  ( 1999)),  Eleutherios (SEG 26  978  (C 5)),  once  probably  also  as  Patroios  (IG xii suppl. 208  (C 4),  following  Berranger  ( 1992)  186).  There  is also  a  horos  of  Hypatos  of  C 5  which  may  be  an  epithet  of Zeus  (IG xii.5183  LSCG 203  no. 109,with  Berranger  ( 1992) 185).  This  inscription  comes  from  Mt.  Kounados,  where Zeus  had  a  sanctuary  that  may  be  quite  ancient.  Apollo's  cult was  widespread  with  multiple  epithets:  Hekebolos  (IG xii.5 148  (C 5?);  the  deity  is  restored  on  the  basis  of  the  epithet); Delios  (Hymn.  Hom.  Ap. 44;  IG xii.5214  (C 4),  a  horos;five further  examples  in  BE  ( 1964)  341),  and  with  Artemis  and Leto  as  the  Delian  triad  in  C 5l  (Matthaiou  and  Kouragios ( 1992\u00ad98)  438  no. 2),  Pythios  (IG xii.5134.8 add.  p. 309), whose  Pythion  was  the  archive  for  public  documents  (IG xii.5  110.9\u00ad11  (C 4));  it  is  uncertain  whether  the  Pythion  is  to be  identified w ith  the  temple,  surely  Apollo's,  located  out- side  the  city  walls  on  a  terrace  above  the  Asklepieion  and  in use  from  C 7  but  reconstructed  in  C 4f  (Schuller  ( 1982b) 245\u00ad46,  262\u00ad64;  Berranger  ( 1992)  97\u00ad103  for  the  doubts). Artemis  appears  without  epithet  and  as  Delios  (IG xii.5216 (C 5),  211  (C 4)),  and  there  is  evidence  for  the  cult  of  Hermes ( \u00b5,  Ergon  ( 1960)  184).  Aphrodite  (Matthaiou  and Kouragios  ( 1992\u00ad98)  437\u00ad38  no. 1  (C 4f)),  and  Ge,  although her  cult  may  have  been  private  rather  than  official (Despinis ( 1979)  22829) (C4m)).  Worship  of  the  Charites,  attested  in C 2  (IG xii  suppl. 206),  would  seem  to  go  back  much  earlier (Apollod.  Bibl. 3.15.7.7).  Herakles,  who  had  important mythological  connections  with  Paros  (Apollod.  Bibl. 2.5.9.3\u00ad6),  is  mentioned  as  Kallinikos  by  Archilochos  (fr. 324.1).  Dionysos  appears  in  a  catalogue  (IG xii.5134.9). Asklepios  (IG xii.5  119  (C 4),  name  not  wholly  clear)  had  a  sanctuary  outside  the  city,  probably  begun  around  C 4s  (Berranger  ( 1992)  104\u00ad5;  Semeria  ( 1986)  953).  Hestia's cult,  attested  by  an  inscription  of  c. 525\u00ad500  (IG xii.5238 with  Gruben  ( 1982a)  673),  was  practised  in  a  building  that  has  been  identified as a prytaneion  (Gruben  ( 1982a) 673). The  Parians  consulted  oracles  as  a  community  with  some frequency  throughout  their  history;  instances  relating  to Apollo  at  Delphi  before  323  are  recounted  in  a  Hellenistic account  of  the  founding  of  Thasos  (SEG 15  517.ii.43\u00ad47, 50\u00ad52  with  Anth.  Pal. 14.113  and  Berranger  ( 1992)  178\u00ad80),  in Herodotos  ( 6.135.2\u00ad3)  and  in  Diodorus  ( 15.13.4,before founding  the  colony  at  Pharos,  after  385;  cf.  Fontenrose ( 1978)  248\u00ad49  H 14). The  polis  centre  was  walled  from  perhaps  as  early  as  C 7, but  certainly  in  C 6;  the  wall  encompassed  the  hill  that  served as  the  Parian  acropolis,  and  much  of  its  course  has  now  been traced.  It  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 50  ha  (Berranger  ( 1992) 62\u00ad65;  Schilardi  ( 1975a)  197\u00ad203  with 198  fig. 1).  More  sec- tions  continue  to  be  discovered  (see  Zapheiropoulou  ( 1987) 490\u00ad91,(1990)  403,(1992)  541).Some  additional  archaeolog- ical  finds in the polis  centre  are  discussed  in  Kouragios 766 reger ( 1996).  The  wall  is  mentioned  in  literary  sources  (Hdt. 6.133.2  (rC 6l);  Ephor.  fr. 63  (r 489)).  A  C 4s  horos  inscribed    was  presumably  set  up  to  mark  the  line between  the  town  (polis)  and  its  hinterland  (Hansen  ( 1996) 37  with  nn. 148  and 149)  and/or  between  the  town  and  its harbour  (Gauthier  in  BE  ( 1999)  420);  for  a  different  inter- pretation,  see  Matthaiou  ( 1992\u00ad98b)  441\u00ad47).  Paros  had  two harbours,  one  of  which  is  described  as  closed  ( , Ps.-Skylax 58).  For  remains  of  the  harbour,  see  Berranger ( 1992)  57\u00ad58. A  prytaneion,  mentioned  in  207/6  (I.Magnesia 50.67\u00ad68), may  have  existed  as  early  as  C 5  and  was  rebuilt  in  C 4s (Gruben  ( 1982a)  676\u00ad83;see IG xii.5.281.3  (undated)). Probable  remains  of  a  bouleuterion  of  C 4  have been  identi- fied (Berranger-Auserve ( 2000)  101).  Sanctuaries  and  cult sites  include  perhaps  one  of  Poseidon  up  by Kargadousa (Rubensohn  ( 1949)  1854;  Schilardi  ( 1975b)  95  (C 5  or  C 4); Berranger  ( 1992)  123),  sites  of  Eileithyaia,  Zeus  Hypatos,  and perhaps  Aphrodite  (C 6\u00adC4)  (Berranger  ( 1992)  82\u00ad85), which  may  be  identical  with  the  sanctuary  reported  on Kounados  hill  (Rubensohn  ( 1901)  181,  215)  of  C 6m  or  earlier date  (Ohnesorg  ( 1994);  H\u00fcbner  ( 1994));  Kore  had  a  sanctu- ary  in  C 5  (IG xii.5225  LSCG 205  no. 110,  with  Berranger ( 1992)  93\u00ad95),  but  whether  this  should  be  identified w ith Temple  B  on  the  Parian  acropolis  (as  Gruben  ( 1982a) 174\u00ad79)  is  uncertain  (Berranger  ( 1992)  241);  Apollo  Delios was  worshipped  at  the  famous  Delion  a  few  kilometres north  of  town  on  a  hill  called  Kynthos  (Rubensohn  ( 1962); cf.  Schuller  ( 1982a);  Berranger  ( 1992)  81\u00ad82;for a horos,see IG xii.5214  (C 4)),  which  included  a  temple  of  Artemis (Schuller  ( 1991));  a  sanctuary  of  Apollo  (possibly  the Pythion,  but  see  Berranger  ( 1992)  97\u00ad103)  and  an Asklepieion  were  located  on  a  hill  east  of  town  that  may  also house  the  Thesmophorion  (Berranger  ( 1992)  90\u00ad105), which  was  in  any  case  outside  the  city  walls  (Hdt. 6.134.2), and  another  sanctuary  for  Demeter  Karpophoros  based  on a  dedication  (Schilardi  ( 1977)  376\u00ad77).  Finally,  there  was  the famous  sanctuary  of  Archilochos,  the  Archilocheion,  built about 350,  where  his  poetry  and  a  biography  were  inscribed and  whose  location  is  still  a  matter  for  uncertainty  (though it  is  probably  at  Elitas,  as  often  suggested:  Ohnesorg  ( 1982); cf.  Berranger  ( 1992)  108\u00ad12).Further  from  the  central  polis,a temple  of  Athena  has  been  discovered  at  Koukounaries  dat- ing  from  c. 700  into  C 4  (Schilardi  ( 1996)  42\u00ad53).  Evidence  of several  temples  of  Archaic  or  Classical  date  has  come  to  light near  the  bay  of  Marmara;  that  at  least  one  sanctuary  existed there  is  proved  by  an  inscription  of  Classical  date  (IG xii.5 256;  cf.  Schnieringer  ( 1982)  and  Berranger  ( 1992)  125\u00ad29). Paros  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard  from c. 525.The  earliest  are  staters.  Types:  obv.  kneeling  goat  facing left  accompanied  by  a  fish/dolphin,  or  goat  looking  right,  or goat  within  circle  of  pearls,  or  goat  turning  left,  or  leaping goat;  rev.  incuse  square  sometimes  with  star.  These  contin- ued  into  C 5e,with  the  addition  of  two  goats  butting  heads  to the  reverse  types.  c. 510\u00ad480,  drachms  were  struck.  Types: obv.  goat  looking  right,  with  or  without  a  circlet  of  pearls; legend  on  some: or ;  rev.  incuse  square,  or  goat looking  back  (Berranger  ( 1992)  283\u00ad89).  An epigram  of Simonides  (C 6s\u00adC5f)  refers  to a  statue  of  Artemis  costing 200  Parian  dr.  (Simon.  fr. 114,  Diehl,  from  Diog.  Laert. 4.45). Coinage  was  resumed  in  357  on  the  Rhodian  standard  (after 338  according  to  Berranger-Auserve  ( 2000)  109\u00ad10). Denominations:  tetradrachms,  didrachms,  drachms.  Silver types:  obv.  goat;  legend  on  some: ;  rev.  ear  of  grain,  or wreaths  of  grain:  legend: or or . Bronze types:  obv.  goat  facing  right  or  left,  or  female  head (possibly  Demeter);  rev.  ear  of  grain,  or  goat  (Head,  HN \u00b2 489;  SNG  Cop.  Aegean  Islands 715\u00ad20;  Berranger  ( 1992) 283\u00ad89;  Sheedy  ( 1996)). The  Parians  colonised  Parion  (no. 756)  in  Asia  Minor c. 708  with  the  Milesians  (no. 854)  and  the  Erythrians  (no. 845)  (Strabo  13.1.14;  Euseb.  Chron. 2,  18th  Olymp. 1; Berranger  ( 1992)  168\u00ad69),  and  Thasos  (no. 526)  c. 710\u00ad680 under  the  oecist  Telesikles,  the  poet  Archilochos'  father (Thuc. 4.104.4;Strabo 10.5.7  ( 487);  Steph.  Byz. 306.20\u00ad307.2; Berranger  ( 1992)  170\u00ad84,  esp. 176\u00ad78  on  the  date  of 680 inferred  from  IG xii.5  444.48\u00ad49  (FGrHist 239);  for Herakles'  mythological  role,  see  Apollod.  Bibl. 2.5.9.13).  One thousand  men  are  said  to  have  been  dispatched  (IG xii.5 445.iv.22,  quoting  Archil.  fr. 97).  Continued  close  political relations  between  Paros  and  its  colony  Thasos  are  attested  in an  epigram  of  C 6l  in  which  a  certain  Akeratos  boasts  that  he (alone)  had  held  high  office in both poleis  (IG xii  suppl. 412; CEG i416;  see  Graham  ( 1983)  74\u00ad76).  It  is  possible  that  the Parians  were  involved  in  C 6e  or  C 5s  in  Eion  (no. 630) (Lazaridis  ( 1976);  Berranger  ( 1992)  169\u00ad70).  At  some  time, but  possibly  later  (the  date  remains  very  uncertain),  Paros may  have  tried  to  found  a  colony  at  Anchiale  in  the  Adriatic (Steph.  Byz. 24.13;  Berranger  ( 1992)  162\u00ad64).Pharos  (no. 84), originally  called  Paros  (so  Strabo  7.5.5),  followed  in  385/4 (Steph.  Byz. 659.7,from Ephor.fr. 89;Diod.  15.4;  Parke  and Wormell  ( 1956)  2.76  no .  177,  164,  no .429;  L.  Robert  ( 1935); see  also  ( 1960b)). Oliaros  ( ':  Ps.-Skylax 48;Strabo 10.5.3)  and Prepesinthos  ( :Strabo 10.5.3),  the  two  small islands  west  of  Paros  (Map  60,  inset),  have  been  suggested, the  aegean  767 reasonably,  as  dependencies  of  Paros  (Lanzillotta  ( 1987)  190; Sherk  ( 1990)  278).  Steph.  Byz. 708.9\u00ad12  reports  that  Oliaros was  a  colony  (apoikia)  of  the  Sidonians.  IG xii.5471  is  from Siphnos,  not  Oliaros  (cf.  IG xii  suppl.  p. 111;  SEG 33  680). P eparethos  (P eparethios)  Map 55.  Lat. 39.05,long. 23.45.  Size of  territory: 2  ( 97  km \u00b2).  The  toponym  is ,  (Hymn.  Hom.  Ap. 32;Dem.  18.70),  denoting both  the  island  (Soph.  Phil. 548\u00ad49)  and  one  of  the  towns (Dem. 35.35;  Steph.  Byz. 516.23\u00ad24).  The  city-ethnic  is (IG i\u00b3  270.iii.10;  Anaximenes  (FGrHist 72)  fr. 41  Dem. 12.12).  In  the  so-called  Charter  of  the  Second Athenian  Naval  League,  Peparethos  is  listed  under  the  heading polis  (IG ii\u00b2  43.A.78  and 85).  Peparethos  is  called  a  polis  in  the urban  sense  by  Dem. 35.35  and  in  Ps.-Skylax  58,  where  the island  is  described  as    \u00b5(cf.Flensted-Jensen and  Hansen  ( 1996)  156).  The  principal  polis  was  Peparethos; the  names  of  the  other  two  poleis  were  Panormos  (Diod. 15.95.2;Polyaen.  Strat. 6.2)  and  Seleinous  (IG xii.8  661.3).  The collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  abbre- viated  form  on  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  inscriptions (CEG i325.2  F.  Delphes iii.4  179  ( 480/79))  and  in  literary sources  (Pl.  Alc. 116D).  For  the  individual  and  external  use,  see the  Athenian  naval  list  of  C 5l  (IG i\u00b3  1033.85\u00ad86). Peparethos  is  listed  among  the  Kyklades  by  Ps.-Skylax ( 58)  and  Diodorus  ( 15.30.5,  95.1),  whereas  the  island  is described  by  Strabo  at  9.5.16  as  one  of  the  islands  off Magnesia,  and  at  2.5.21  it  is  classed  with  the  islands  lying  off Greece  as  far  as  Makedonia  and  Thrace.  According  to  Ps.- Skymnos  580  and 586,  Peparethos  was  colonised  by  the Chalkidians  from  Euboia. Fighting  on  the  Greek  side  in  the  Persian  War,  the Peparethians  captured  two  Karian  ships  at  Salamis  and  ded- icated  one  tenth  of  the  booty  to  Apollo  at  Delphi  (CEG i 325  F.Delphes iii.4  179).  The  Peparethians  were  members of  the  Delian  League.  They  belonged  to  the  Thracian  district (IG i\u00b3  269.iii.10)  and  are  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from 454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.ii.18)  to  415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.iii.7)  a  total  of  sev- enteen  times,  once  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 3 tal.  (IG i\u00b3  261.iii.5).  They  were  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4 (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.169).  Under  Spartan  hegemony  from  the  end  of the  Peloponnesian  War  until  Chabrias'  expedition  in  the Aegean  in  377/6  (Diod. 15.30.5),  the  Peparethians  joined  the Second  Athenian  Naval  League  in  the  370s  (IG ii\u00b2  43.A.85). In 362/1  (Hansen  ( 1975)  95)  the  island  was  attacked  by  forces of  Alexander  of  Pherai,  which  beseiged  Peparethos  town. The  Athenians  dispatched  assistance,  trapped  Alexander's forces  in  Panormos  and  laid  siege  to  the  town;  he  extracted them  after  a  successful  sea  battle  in  which  one  Peparethian and  five A thenian  triremes  were  captured  (Diod. 15.95.1\u00ad2; Polyaen.  Strat. 6.2.1;  Dreher  ( 1995)  29\u00ad30).  C. 342  the Peparethians  conquered  Halonnesos,  which  by  then  was garrisoned  by the  Makedonians,  but  Philip  of  Makedon deprived  them  soon  after  of  the  possession  of  this  island, and  in  340  he  attacked  and  ravaged  Peparethos  (Dem. 12.12\u00ad15,  18.70  with  schol.  no. 128,  Dilts).  In,  probably, 338", "Kimolos": "Identifier: 499. , (Kimolios) Map  58.  Lat. 36.45,long.  24.30. Size of  territory: 2  ( 36  km \u00b2).  Type:  B.  The  toponym  is \u00b5,  (Strabo  10.5.1;  IG i\u00b3  71.i.89;  F.Delphes iii.1497.12 the  aegean  751 (C 4l/C3e)).The  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.18;per- haps  also  at  1032.87,  where  Osborne  and  Byrne  ( 1996)  123 suggest  reading  \u00b5  &lt; &gt;() instead of  \u00b5).There is no  explicit  Classical  attestation  of  Kimolos  as  a  polis,but in C 5s  the  Kimolians  were  members  of  the  Delian  League (infra);  in  a  C 4s  arbitration  they  were  on  equal  terms  with the  polis  of  Melos  (infra),  and  a  C 3s  text  from  Karystos  does explicitly  refer  to    \u00b5  (SEG 44 710.28).The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  inter- nally  on  coins  of  C 3  (Head,  HN \u00b2484)  and  externally  in inscriptions  (IG i\u00b2  289.i.18;  IG xii.31259.7  (C 4s)  Tod 179; Ager ( 1996)  no. 3;  Magnetto  ( 1997)  no. 1).The  individual  and external  use  is  attested  in  the  Athenian  naval  catalogue  of C 5l  (IG i\u00b3  1032.87). Kimolos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Island  district,  but  is  absent  from  the  full  panel  of 441/0  (IG i\u00b3  271.i\u00adii.88\u00ad101).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.89)  ( 1,000  dr.),  but  is  recorded  only  once  in the  tribute  lists,  viz.in 416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.18),  paying  an unknown  amount. Soon  after  338  the  Kimolians  were  involved  in  a  dispute with  the  Melians  (no. 505)  over  the  possession  of  the  three small  islands  of  Polyaiga  (which,  later  at  least,  had  no  per- manent  population  but  was  used  as  pasturage  (L.  Robert ( 1949)  167)),  Etereia  and  Libeia.  In  accordance  with  a  deci- sion  of  the  synedrion  of  the  League  of  Corinth,  the  dispute was  submitted  to  arbitration  by  Argos  (no. 347),  and  the Argives  decided  in  favour  of  Kimolos  (IG xii.31259  Tod 179;  Ager  ( 1996)  no. 3;  Magnetto  ( 1997)  1\u00ad8  no. 1).  A  certain amount  of  the  ancient  polis  centre  (which,  unlike  most Aegean  Islands,  does  not  lie  under  modern  Chora)  has  been lost  due  to  sea  level  changes  (Mustakas  ( 1954\u00ad55)  153\u00ad54). Lauffer  ( 1989)  329  has  references  to  walls,  sanctuaries  and other  remains. 497.Kos  (Koos) Map  61.  Lat. 36.50,long.  27.15.  Size  of  ter- ritory: 4  ( 290  km \u00b2).Type:A  (from  366/5,infra).The  toponym is ,  (Hom.  Il. 2.677;  Hdt. 9.76.2;  Thuc. 8.41.3;Herzog ( 1928)  14\u00ad16  no. 5.B.8  (C 4m);  Head,  HN \u00b2632  (C 5))  or   (Hymn.  Hom.  Ap. 42;  Hes.  fr. 43a.57).  The  toponym  denotes sometimes  the  island  (Thuc. 8.41.3),  sometimes,  probably, the  city  (Hdt. 1.144.3;  Thuc. 8.41.2),  and sometimes  the  C 4  synoecised  polis  (Dem. 15.27).  The  ethnic is (IG i\u00b3  262.iv.15;  Hdt. 7.99.2).  It  sometimes  denotes the  inhabitants  of  the  island  (Hdt. 9.76.2\u00ad3;  Pl.  Prt. 311B),and sometimes  the  citizens  of  the  polis  (IG i\u00b3  1454.A.29;  Iscr.  Cos ED 34.5  (C 4)).  Kos  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense (Ps.-Skylax  99;Dem.  35.35,  see  Hansen  ( 2000)  154;  LSCG 151.55  (C 4m);  perhaps  Paton  and  Hicks  ( 1891)  no. 5.7\u00ad8)  and in  the  political  sense  (Dem. 15.27  and  inscriptions  of  after 366/5:  Iscr.  Cos  ED 19.4\u00ad5  (C 4\u00adC3),  20.1,  3,  11  (all  C 4l),  54.8\u00ad9 (C 4),  55.A11,  17,B10,  13  (C 4),  241.26  (C 4)).  The  collective use of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  inscriptions  (Iscr. Cos  ED 19.5,  54.4,  55.B.3)  and  externally  in  literary  sources (Hdt. 1.144.3,  7.99.2)  and  in  inscriptions  (IG i\u00b3  262.iv.15;  CID i12.2  (C 4f);  F.Delphes iii.1497.11  (C 4l/C3e);  SEG 92.28, Kyrene  (c. 330\u00ad326)).  The  external  and  individual  use  of  the ethnic  is  attested  in  literary  sources  (Hdt. 7.163.2,  9.76.2;  Pl. Prt. 311B)  and  in  inscriptions  (IG i\u00b3  1454.29  (C 5s);  IG ii\u00b2  9143 (C 4f);  Peek  ( 1969)  25  no. 53  (C 5)). The  Koans  belonged  to  the  Dorian  pentapolis  (Hdt. 1.144.3  with  Sherwin-White  ( 1978)  47)  and  to  the  Delian League,  paying  tribute  (infra).  Within  this  framework  fit at least  two  poleis  up  until  366/5,and  it  is  not  always  easy  to  dis- tinguish  before  this  date  the  use  of  the  ethnic  as  a  city-ethnic from  its  use  as  a  regional  ethnic  denoting  an  inhabitant  of the  island  of  Kos. In  Homer  Kos  and  the  Kalydnian  islands  (no. 485)  are explicitly  decribed  as  \"the  poleis  of  Eurypylos\"  (Hom.  Il. 2.677,see  also  14.255,15.28).Hymn.  Hom.  Ap  42  describes  Kos as     . According to Herodotos ( 7.99.3),  Kos  was  settled  by  the  Epidaurians  (no. 348). After  the  collapse  of  Kroisos'  Lydian  kingdom  and  the imposition  of  Achaemenid  suzerainty  in  western  Asia Minor  in  546,  Kos  was  controlled  by  the  tyrant  Skythes. C. 490  his  son  Kadmos  voluntarily  abdicated  the  tyranny (Hdt. 7.164.1),  and  control  of  Kos  passed  to  the  Karian dynasty  under  Artemisia,  whose  command  at  Salamis included  Koan  sailors  (Hdt. 6.22\u00ad24,  7.99.2,  163\u00ad64,).Kos may  have  controlled  the  island  of  Nisyros  (no. 508)  c. 500 (Hdt. 7.99  with  Hicks  in  Paton  and  Hicks  ( 1891)  p.  xii). Kos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Karian  district  (IG i\u00b3  269.iv.15)  and  is  recorded  in  the tribute  lists  from  451/0  (IG i\u00b3  262.iv.15)  to  427/6  or 426/5  (IG i\u00b3  284.18)  a  total  of  eleven  times,  once  completely  restored, paying  a  phoros  of 5  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  271.ii.67);  but  in  some  years ( 450/49,  447/6)  the  phoros  is  split  up  into  smaller  amounts (IG i\u00b3  263.i.7  and v.40).The  explanation  may  be  that  in  these years  two  poleis  on  Kos  paid  separately,  whereas  in  other years  they  paid  together  in  a  synteleia.  Kos  was  assessed  for tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.132). Some  time  in  the  same  period  a  temenos  of  Athena Medeousa,  an  indication  of  Athenian  authority,  was installed;  but  from  this  a  klerouchia  should  not  necessarily be  inferred  (Iscr.  Cos  EV 361,  see  also  EV  333;  Mattingly ( 1996)  65).  A  copy  of  the  famous  Athenian  Coinage  Decree 752 reger was  posted  on  Kos  (Iscr.  Cos  ED 1  ML 45).  Kos  remained under  the  Athenians  until  411  (Thuc. 8.108.2);  over  the  next five y ears  its  position  shifted,  till  apparently  coming  under Spartan  sway  for  good  in  407  (Diod. 13.69.5;Xen.  Hell. 1.5.1; cf.  Hicks  in  Paton  and  Hicks  ( 1891)  pp.  xxv\u00adxxvi).  The  Koans fell  away  from  the  Spartans  in  394  following  the  battle  of Knidos  (Diod. 14.84.3),  but  their  name  does  not  appear  on the  stele  of  Aristoteles  among  the  members  of  the  Second Athenian  Naval  League  (for  membership:  Cargill  ( 1981) 37\u00ad38;  contra  Hornblower ( 1982)  133;  non  liquet  Dreher ( 1995)  123).  But  in  357,  when  Chios  (no. 840),  Rhodos  (no. 1000)  and  Byzantion  (no. 674)  seceded  from  the  Naval League,  Kos  joined  the  alliance  concluded  with  Mausolos and  took  part  in  the  Social  War  against  Athens  (Dem. 15.3, 27;Diod.  16.7.3;  cf.  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 305). In C 4m  Kos  was  controlled  by  the  Hekatomnids  (Suda 238  with  Hornblower  ( 1982)  132\u00ad33).  In  333  the  island  was conquered  by Alexander  (Arr.  Anab. 2.5.7),  won  back  by  the Persians,  but  conquered  definitively in  332  (Arr.  Anab. 3.2.6). During  the  crisis  of  c. 330\u00ad326,  Kos  received  10,000  medim- noi  of  grain  from  Kyrene  (no. 1028)  (SEG 92.28). A  unified K oan  state  was  created  in  366/5  by  the  metoik- ismos  of  at  least  two  pre-existing  poleis,  Astypalaia  and  Kos Meropis  (see  infra).  This  action  is  attested  by  Diodorus ( 15.76.2)  and  Strabo  ( 14.2.19).  The  event  has  been  treated often:  e.g.  Hicks  in  Paton  and  Hicks  ( 1891)  p.  xxvii;  Moggi, Sin. 333\u00ad41  no. 47;  Sherwin-White  ( 1978)  63\u00ad67;  Hornblower ( 1982)  83\u00ad84,  103\u00ad4  n. 197;  Demand  ( 1990)  127\u00ad32;Reger ( 2001)  171\u00ad74.  Strabo  attributes  the  decision  to  stasis.The incident  referred  to by Arist.  Pol. 1304b25  is  surely  later (Sherwin-White  ( 1978)  65\u00ad66,  contra  Gehrke,  Stasis 98).  It has  been  denied  that  a  political  unification of  separate  poleis in  fact  occurred,  as  has  been  virtually  the  universal  scholar- ly  opinion  until  recently  (Stylianou  ( 1998)  484\u00ad85),  but  the details  of  the  organisation  of  the  two  poleis  leave  little  doubt that  the  standard  view  is  right  (see  now  Reger  ( 2001)  171\u00ad74 and  infra),  except  in  so  far  as  the  Koans,  like  other  islanders and  certain  other  small  states,  paid  their  tribute  to  Athens  as a  group  and  were  identified as a g roup  of  islands. The  eponymous  magistrate  of  the  unified K oan  polis  was the  monarchos  (Herzog  ( 1928)  20\u00ad25  no. 8.A1  (C 3f);  cf. Gehrke,  Stasis 97  n. 1;  Sherk  ( 1990)  265\u00ad66).  Decrees  were passed  by  the  boule  and  the  ekklesia  (Iscr.  Cos  ED 54.1  (C 4)) or  by the  ekklesia  (Iscr.  Cos  ED 34.1  (C 4))  on  the  motion  of  a board  of  prostatai  as  moved  by  the  head  of  the  board  (Iscr. Cos  ED 40.1\u00ad4;  Paton  and  Hicks  ( 1891)  no. 2.9\u00ad10)  or  by an individual  (Iscr.  Cos  ED 34.2,  54.1\u00ad2).  An  epistates  is  also attested  (Iscr.  Cos  ED 106.2\u00ad3  (C 4));  cf.  Rhodes,  DGS 237. Koan  officials included a board of  poletai  (Iscr.  Cos  ED 20.16 (C 4l),  54.13\u00ad14  (C 4)).  One  text  mentions   [  (Iscr.  Cos  ED 26c5  (C 4l?)),  and  a  dikasterion  is mentioned  in  Iscr.  Cos  ED 90.4,  9  (C 4e). Aristotle  says  that  the  Koan  constitition  was  a  democracy subverted  by  demagogues  and  then  replaced  by  an  oligarchy (Arist.  Pol. 1304b25\u00ad27).Kos  became  a  democracy  once  again in,  probably, 332  (Gehrke,  Stasis 99  n. 18). A  fragmentary  early  sacred  law  mentions     (Iscr. Cos  ED 53  (C 4;C5\u00adC4  according  to  Herzog  ( 1899)  128\u00ad30  no. 194));  a  later  law  of  C 4  protects  the  trees  of  the  temenos  of Apollo  Kyparissios  and  Asklepios  from  being  cut  down  for any  reason,  and  forbade  even  the  introduction  of  a  motion to  that  effect  (Herzog  ( 1928)  32  no. 12  Iscr.  Cos  ED 181).  A series  of  sacred  laws  of  C 4m  seems  to  regulate  religious observances  of  the  newly  constructed  Koan  state  (Herzog ( 1928)  5\u00ad10  no. 1,  12\u00ad14  no. 4  LSCG 151,  19\u00ad25  nos. 6\u00ad8, 32\u00ad33  no. 12  LSCG 150  Iscr.  Cos  ED 55,  140,  181,  241;per- haps  also  ED  53  of  C 4).  The  many  public  cults  known  from Kos  thanks  in  large  part  to  the  rich  harvest  of  sacred  laws include  those  of  ( 1)  Apollo  Kyparissios  (cf.  Hymn.  Hom.  Ap. 42)  and  ( 2)  Asklepios  (Herzog  ( 1928)  32\u00ad33  no. 12  Iscr.  Cos ED 181);  ( 3)  Hera (Makareus,  FGH 4.442  (Ath. 262C));  ( 4) Rhea,  Hera  Argeia  Eleia  Basileia,  Zeus  Machanes,  the  Twelve Gods,  Zeus  Polieus,  Athena  Machanis  (Iscr.  Cos  ED 241);  ( 5) Homonoia,  Hekate,  Histia  Tamia,  Aphrodite  Pandemos (Pugliese  Carratelli  ( 1963\u00ad64)  158  no.  I;  Paton  and  Hicks ( 1891)  401;  LSCG 295\u00ad98  no. 169  (C 3))  with  the  important discussion  of  the  circumstances  of  the  origin  of  the  cult  of Homonoia  in  Th\u00e9riault  ( 1996)  134\u00ad36);  ( 6)  Zeus  Basileus (Iscr.  Cos  EV 27  (C 4));  ( 7)  Kore  (Iscr.  Cos  EV 235  (C 4l));  ( 8) Demeter  (Iscr.  Cos  EV 270  (C 4));  ( 9)  the  Nymphs  (LSCG 152\u00ad53);  and  ( 10)  Herakles  (Iscr.  Cos  ED 140.8\u00ad9;  cf.  also  ED 149),  whose  worship  should  no  doubt  be  associated  with  his adventure  on  Kos  in  which  he  was  wounded  (see  Koenen and  Merkelbach  ( 1976)). In C 4  the  Koans  awarded  proxenia  to citizens  of  Tyros (Iscr.  Cos  ED 54),  Knidos  (no. 903)  (Iscr.  Cos  ED 34), Byzantion  (no. 674)  (Iscr.  Cos  ED 40),  Mytilene  (no. 798) (Iscr.  Cos  ED 106)  and  Sinope  (no. 729)  (Iscr.  Cos  ED 20). Koan  citizens  were  awarded  proxenia  by  Epidauros  (no. 348) (IAEpid. 42.58  (C 4l/C3e))  and  the  Plataseis  (Labraunda 48  Mausolos  M 8). The  Koan  state  was  organised  into  the  three  traditional Dorian  tribes  of  Pamphyloi,  Hylleis  and  Dymanes,  further subdivided  into  three  chiliastyes  each,  also  called  enatai (LSCG 151A.5,  16  (C 4m);  Herzog  ( 1928)  6  no. 1.7,  11,  12,  15;  cf. Jones,  POAG 236\u00ad38).Each  tribe  had  its  own  special  location the  aegean  753 for  sacrifice ( Iscr.  Cos  ED 140.2\u00ad5  (C 4)).  In  addition  there were  an  unknown  number  of  triakades  (Iscr.  Cos  ED 55.A2 (C 4m))  and  pentekostyes  (Iscr.  Cos  ED 91.3  (C 4))  whose  rela- tionship  to  the  tribes  and  their  subdivisions  remains  uncer- tain  (Jones,  POAG 238\u00ad39).  Cutting  across  this  system  of personal  groupings  there  was  a  subdivision  into  at  least  ten demes  (cf.  the  list  in  Jones,  POAG 239).  One  of  these, Isthmos  (demotic: \u00b5  '\u00b5,  IG xi.2287.B.45 (C 3m)),  was  located  at  the  site  of  Astypalaia  (see  infra). Another  deme--which one is not known,  unfortunately-- also  had  at  least  one  tribal  subdivision  (Iscr.  Cos  ED 138.1\u00ad2 (c. 206/5);  see  Habicht  ( 2000)  309\u00ad10,  327  (date)). Parts  of  Kos  town  have  been  the  object  of  intensive  exca- vation,  particularly  after  a  severe  earthquake  of  the  1930s opened  up  opportunities  for  the  Italian  archaeologists working  there;  no  final e xcavation  reports  have  ever  been published,  but  there  is  a  good  summary  of  the  state  of  work as  of  the  1940s  (Morricone  ( 1950)).  Long  runs  of  the  fortifi- cation  walls  have  been  uncovered  (des  Courtils  et al.( 1982) 414;  BCH 118  ( 1994)  798),  perhaps  the  walls  of 366/5  (Diod. 15.76.2).  Sanctuaries  include  the  great  Asklepieion,  begun  in C 4  but  a  site  of  worship  originally  of  Apollo  in  C 5 (Schatzmann  ( 1932)  \"Zeittafel\";  for  an  altar  of  C 4  bearing the  names  of  some  of  Asklepios'  children,  see  p. 26);  a  sanc- tuary  for  Artemis,  Zeus  Hikesios  and  the  Theoi  Patrioi  (SEG 14  529  (C 2));  temples  for  Demeter  and  Dionysos  in  the  town centre (Iscr.  Cos  ED 140.5  (C 4);  BCH 118  ( 1994)  795). Remains  of  the  theatre  (TGR  ii. 147)  are  Hellenistic (Sherwin-White  ( 1978)  25);  but  references  to the  theatre in Eudoxos  (fr. 363,  Lasserre)  testify  to  a  C 4  antecedent.  A  sanc- tuary  of  the  Twelve  Gods  is  attested  in  a  C 4  inscription  (Iscr. Cos  ED 54.15;  see  also  their  worship  at  the  Charmyleion: Paton  and  Hicks  ( 1891)  no. 349  with  Kader  ( 1995)  201\u00ad2).  A sanctuary  of  Demeter,  a  \u00b5,is attested (Iscr.Cos  ED 140.5).  A  sanctuary  starting  in  C 4m  to  the  Eleusinian  gods has  been  located  at  Kyparisi  (Laurenzi  ( 1931)  623\u00ad25).  A  stoa by  the  harbour  may  date  from  C 4  (Coulton  ( 1976)  248). Next  to  nothing  is  known  about  Hippokrates  of  Kos  (Pl. Phdr. 270C;  Prt. 311B)  and  his  medical  school  of  Asklepiadai (CID i12  (C 4f)).  The  various  pseudepigraphica  about Hippokrates  and  Kos  are  late  innovations  and  cannot  be used  for  reliable  information  about  the  institutions  and  his- tory  of  the  Koan  polis  in  C 6l\u00adC5s  (Jouanna  ( 1999)  12\u00ad16, 21\u00ad24;  for  the  writings,  see  now  Smith  ( 1990)). Kos  struck  coins  of  electrum  and  silver  on  the  Aeginetan standard  in  C 6,  coins  of  silver  on  the  Persic  standard  in  C 5f, and  coins  of  silver  and  bronze  after  366/5.(1)  Silver  and  elec- trum,  C 6.  Types:  obv.  crab;  rev.  incuse  square.  ( 2)  Silver,  C 5f. Types:  obv.  naked  diskobolos  with  tripod  behind;  legend: or or ;  rev.  crab  in  incuse  square.  ( 3) Silver from 395:  obv.  head  of  bearded  or  beardless  Herakles often  with  lion's  scalp,  facing  l.  or  r.;  rev.  crab  and  club  in dotted  incuse  square,  or  draped  female  head  facing  l. (Demeter?);  legend: or and  magistrate's name.  ( 4)  Bronze  from  c. 330:  obv.  head  of  beardless  Herakles with  lion's  scalp;  rev.  crab;  legend: and  magistrate's name  (Head,  HN \u00b2632\u00ad34;  Paton  and  Hicks  ( 1891)  pp. 305\u00ad6; Barron  ( 1968);  Erxleben  ( 1970)  87\u00ad88;Kraay ( 1976)  245\u00ad46; Ingvaldsen  ( 2002);  SNG  Cop.  Caria 615\u00ad26).  There  has  been some  discussion  about  whether  the  legend  on some  coins  should  be  taken  as  a  Doric  genitive  plural  (hence the  ethnic)  or  as  a  ktetikon  (so  Sherwin-White  ( 1978)  45);  in light  of  the  widespread  variability  in  practice  with  respect  to amphora  stamps,  even  in  poleis  that  used  the  Ionic  alphabet (see  Garlan  ( 1999)  19\u00ad20),  final judgement m ust  be  sus- pended.  (Koray  Konuk  (pers.  comm.)  reports  that  he  has reinvestigated  Koan  coins  and  come  up  with  important  new results,  but  these  have  not  been  published.) The  Koans  are  said  to  have  participated  in  the  colonisa- tion  of  Elpia  in  Apulia  (Strabo  14.2.10).  In  an  inscription  of C 3m  the  Koans  are  called  synoikistai  of  Kamarina  (no. 28) (SEG 12  379  Rigsby  ( 1996)  no. 48  (C 3m);  Plut.  Tim. 35.1\u00ad2 (emended);  see  Talbert  ( 1974)  204). There  are  two  poleis  well  attested  for  Kos  before  the metoikismos  of 366/5:  Astypalaia  and  Kos  Meropis. 498.  Astypalaia Map 61.  Lat. 36.45,long.  27.00.  Size  of territory: 3  (c. 145  km \u00b2  or  less).  Type:  C.  The  toponym  is ,  (Strabo  14.2.19;  Steph.  Byz. 140.8).  There  is no  explicit  attestation  of  the  city-ethnic  (infra).  The  name  of this  town  is  known  certainly  only  from  the  description  by Strabo  ( 14.2.19)  of  the  metoikismos  of  Kos  in  366/5  (supra). For  the  possibility  that  the  city  was  mentioned  in  Galen,  see Walzer  ( 1935)  336  app.  with  further  references.  Astypalaia became  the  deme  of  Isthmos  in  the  unified K oan  state (Sherwin-White  ( 1978)  59  and  especially  Pugliese  Carratelli ( 1963\u00ad64)).  The  toponym  is  '\u00b5  (LSCG 154A.18  (C 3f)). The  demotic  is  '\u00b5  (Iscr.  Cos  ED 55B.9  (C 4)). Isthmos  displayed  its  own  internal  organisation:  in  the Hellenistic  period  the  deme  was  itself  divided  into  three tribes,  the  Theadai,  Kyniadai  and  Melainadai  (Pugliese Carratelli  ( 1963\u00ad64)  161\u00ad63  no.  VI.a 4\u00ad5  and  a 25  with  a 8; 165\u00ad81  nos.  IX\u00adXVIII  with  Jones,  POAG 239\u00ad41).  Although there  is  no  explicit  evidence,  the  peculiarity  of  this  deme  in having  its  own  tribal  organisation  would  seem  to  find its best  explanation  in  Isthmos'  earlier  status,  like  that  of 754 reger Astypalaia,  as  a  self-governing  polis  before  the  metoikismos, or  in  the  possibility  that  it  persisted  to  function  as  a  polis, albeit  a  dependent  polis,  after  the  synoecism.  Another  possi- ble  piece  of  evidence  is  the  fact  that  Isthmos  dispatched  a theoria  on  its  own  account  to  Delos  in  250  (IG xi.2287.B.45). A  monarchos  attested  at  Astypalaia  should  be  taken  as  the eponymous  magistrate  (Reger  ( 2001)  173\u00ad74  with  refs.;  con- tra  Pugliese  Carratelli  ( 1957)).  A  sanctuary  of  C 5  sits  on  the acropolis  at  Kephalos,  the  urban  site  of  Astypalaia (MacKenzie  ( 1897\u00ad98);  Herzog  ( 1901)  138,(1903)  2\u00ad4; Sherwin-White  ( 1978)  27  n. 84  for  more  refs.).  The  cult  of Asklepios  was  a  local  cult  here  before  the  metoikismos,  which introduced  it  to  the  island  as  a  whole. 499.

Minoa  is  referred  to  as  a  polis  in  the urban  sense  by  the  term  at  Ps.-Skylax  58  and  is called  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  IG xii.768.2  (C 4/C3), where  the  collective  and  internal  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested.  The  external  use  is  attested  collectively  in Androtion  (FGrHist 324  fr. 22)  and  individually  in  a  C 3  prox- eny  decree  from  Tenos  (IG xii.5821.3).  A  board  of  prytaneis is  attested  in  a  citizenship  decree  of  C 5\u00adC4  (IG xii.7219).  A cult  of  Apollo  Pythios  (or  possibly  Delios),  who  may  have been  the  protective  deity,  is  known  from  a  sacred  nomos  of C 5\u00adC4  (IG xii.7  220).  The  urban  centre  was  walled  starting in  the  Geometric  period  (Marangou  ( 1990)).  The  walls enclosed  an  area  of  c. 20  ha.  A  separately  walled  acropolis inside  the  polis  covered an area of  c. 4.5  ha.  (AR 47 ( 2000\u00ad2001)  122).  There  are  remains  of  a  C 4  gymnasium (Marangou  ( 1987)  255). 474.

Thasos  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the urban  sense  (Archil.  fr. 49.7;  Thuc. 8.64.3,  4,  first occurrence; Dem. 35.35;  Ps.-Skylax 67;  Duch\u00eane  ( 1992)  125  no. 24.1,  15 (C 5m))  and  in  the  political  sense  (IG xii.8356.2  CEG i  415 (C 6l);  IG xii  suppl. 412.2  CEG i  416  (C 6l);  SEG 42  785  passim (C 5f);  ML 83  passim  (C 5l);  SEG 26  1029.5  (C 4s);  Hdt. 6.44.1; Thuc. 8.64.4,second  occurrence);  the  first occurrence at Thuc. 8.64.4  has  the  territorial  sense  as  a  connotation.  The  collective use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on  coins  (infra)  and amphora  stamps  (Garlan  ( 1999)  17\u00ad20)  and  in  inscriptions (IG xii  suppl. 412.1  CEG 416  (C 6l);  ML  83.ii.7,before 407 (Graham  and  Smith  ( 1989));  IG xii.8264.11  (C 4e))  and  exter- nally  in  both  literary  texts  (Archil.  fr. 20;  Thuc. 1.100.2;Dem. 20.59)  and  inscriptions  (IG i\u00b3  101.31  ( 410/9);  IG xii.4109  (C 5); Moretti  ( 1953);  SEG 43  486.33  (C 4m)).  The  individual  and external  use  is  attested  in  inscriptions  (IG i\u00b3  1373\u00ad74  (c. 407);IG iv\u00b2.1  122.7  (C 4m/C4s))  and  in  literary  sources  (Lys. 13.54;Dem. 20.61;  Arist.  Poet. i448a12).  Patris  is  found  in  Dem. 20.59. Ps.-Skylax 67  places  Thasos  in  Thrace,  and  Strabo  classes Thasos  among  the  islands  lying  off  Greece  as  far  as Makedonia  and  Thrace  ( 2.5.21).  Though  Herodotos  men- tions  a  Phoenician  colony  on  Thasos  ( 2.44.4;  cf.  also  Paus. 5.25.12),  the  island  was  more  famously  colonised  by  the Parians  (no. 509)  under  Telesikles  in  710\u00ad680  (Thuc. 4.104.4; Strabo  10.5.7;  Steph.  Byz. 306.14);  for  a  foundation  date  of C 7m,  see  Graham  ( 2001)  228\u00ad29,  365\u00ad402.Archilochos  has  a good  deal  to  say  about  the  circumstances  of  the  early  colony (frr. 92\u00ad112).An  inscription  of  C 5  mentions  as  archegetes  one Sotion  (Pouilloux  ( 1954)  335  no. 127;  cf.  Leschhorn  ( 1984) 56\u00ad60  and  the  useful  summary  in  Pouilloux  ( 1982)); Hippoc.  Epid. 1  case 5  mentions  the  archegetes. 778 reger In C 6l  Thasos  was  controlled  by  the  tyrant  Symmachos, expelled  by  the  Spartans  (Plut.  Mor. 859D;  Salviat  ( 1979) 123\u00ad25;Bowen ( 1992)  119).  The  Thasians  were probably under  an  oligarchy  in  the  earlier  part  of  C 5  (Pouilloux  ( 1954) 43).  They  had  an  income  from  their  mines  on  the  island  and the  peraia  ranging  between  200  and 300  tal./year  c. 500  (Hdt. 6.46.3).  Histiaios  attacked  the  island  in  494,  but  was  repelled by  the  arrival  of  a  Phoenician  fleet (Hdt. 6.28).  In  492  the Thasians  surrendered  to Mardonios  and  remained  under Persian  control  until  479  (Hdt. 6.44.1).  They  joined  the Delian  League  as  contributors  of  ships,  but  revolted  in 466/5;  the  Athenians  besieged  the  island  for  three  years before  finally defeating the r ebels.  The  Thasians  were  forced to  pull  down  their  walls,  to  surrender  their  fleet,  to  pay  an indemnity,  to pay  phoros  in  the  future  and  to  cede  their  pos- sessions  on  the  mainland  (Thuc. 1.100\u00ad1;Plut.  Kim. 14.1\u00ad2 Polyaen. 2.33,  8.67;  IG i\u00b3  1144B.iii.43,  130;  cf.  P\u00e9barthe ( 1999)).  Thasians  appear  thereafter  serving  in  the  Athenian fleet ( IG i\u00b3  1032.431),  and  Athenians  owned  property on Thasos  (IG i\u00b3  426.45,  144).  The  Thasians  became  paying members  of  the  Delian  League.  They  belonged  to  the Thracian  district  (IG i\u00b3  272.ii.56)  and  are  recorded  in  the tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.v.14)  to  429/8  (IG i\u00b3 282.ii.17)  a  total  of  fourteen  times,  once  completely  restored, paying  a  phoros  of 3  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  259.v.14),  raised  to  30  tal.  in 446/5  (IG i\u00b3  266.iii.8)  or  the  year  before  when  the  Thasians are  recorded  three  times  (IG i\u00b3  265.i.94,  107,  ii.66,  restored). The  Thasians  were  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3 71.iii.155)  of 60  tal. In 411,  in  the  wake  of  the  revolution  of  the  Four  Hundred, the  Athenian  strategos  Dieitrephes  abolished  the  democracy in  Thasos  (Thuc. 8.64.2)  and  established  an  oligarchy,  called and \u00b5  by  the  Athenians  in  411  ( 64.3,  5) but by  Thucydides  ( 64.5)  and  by  the  Athenians in 407  in  a  contemporary  inscription  (SEG 38  851.A.4,  19, B. 2\u00ad3,  20).  But  soon  afterwards  the  anti-Athenian  faction got  the  upper  hand,  and  the  Thasians  defected  from  Athens with  the  help  of  a  squadron  commanded  by  Timolaos  of Corinth  (Hell.  Oxy. 10.4\u00ad5;  IG xii.8402).  The  polis  brought back  its  old  institutions,  restored  its  fortification walls and fleet ( Thuc. 8.64.3\u00ad5),  and  accepted  a  Lakedaimonian  har- most  (Xen.  Hell. 1.1.32).  They  punished  Athenian  supporters (IG xii.8263;ML  83;  cf.  Pouilloux  ( 1954)  139\u00ad42  no. 18;  on  the date  of  this  inscription  as  C 5l  but  not  autumn  411  or  spring 410,  see  Graham  and  Smith  ( 1989)).  In  the  following  year  a stasis  among  the  Thasians  resulted  in  a  short-lived  expulsion of  the  pro-Lakedaimonian  faction  (Xen.  Hell. 1.1.32;Gehrke, Stasis 161).  Thasos  must  have  defected  once  again,  for  in 410/9  the  Thasian  colony  Neapolis  (no. 634)  was  besieged  by Thasians  and  Peloponnesians,  but  resisted  with  Athenian support  (IG i\u00b3  101  ML 89;  see  Pouilloux  ( 1954)  155\u00ad60), and  in  the  spring  of 407  the  Athenians  under  Thrasyboulos recovered  the  island  after  a  siege  and  restored  the  democra- cy  (Xen.  Hell. 1.4.9;Diod.  13.72.1),  called  explicitly \u00b5  in  a  contemporary  inscription  (SEG 38 851.A.7  Grandjean  and  Salviat  ( 1988)).  The  Parians  facil- itated  a  reconciliation  between  the  Thasians  and  the Neapolitans  probably  soon  after  407  (IG xii.5109  as  reinter- preted  by  Pouilloux  ( 1954)  178\u00ad92;  Piccirilli  ( 1973)  144\u00ad49 no. 33;  see  also  the  bas-relief  from  Delphi:  Moretti  ( 1953)). Thasos'  mainland  possessions  were  apparently  recovered only  gradually,  in  410\u00ad407  and  the  390s  (Brunet  ( 1997)). With  Spartan  victory  at  the  end  of  the  war,  a squadron under  Eteonikos  captured  Thasos  (Xen.  Hell. 2.2.5).  In Polyaenus  the  conquest  is  ascribed  to  Lysandros,  and  we  are told  that,  after  a  battle,  he  tricked  Athenian  sympathisers who  had  taken  refuge  in  the  temple  of  Herakles  to  surrender, whereupon  they  were  executed  (Polyaen.  Strat. 1.45.4;  the story  is  questioned  by  Gehrke,  Stasis 162\u00ad63).  Thasians  who supported  the  democracy  (IG ii\u00b2  6)  and  had  been  exiled from  Thasos  for  supporting  Athens  (IG ii\u00b2  33.6\u00ad7  with Pouilloux  ( 1954)  203,  and  Polyaen.  Strat. 1.45.4)  were hon- oured  by  the  Athenians  in  C 5l  and  C 4e  (IG ii\u00b2  6,  17,  24,  25,  33; cf.  SEG 15  83\u00ad87,  with  Pouilloux  ( 1954)  203;  Salviat  ( 1979) 120\u00ad25  and  Karamoutzou-Teza  ( 1987)). The  Spartans  controlled  Thasos  from  404,  but,  with  the help  of  a  pro-Athenian  faction,  the  Athenians  recovered  the island  for  themselves  in  389/8  (Dem. 20.59;  IG ii\u00b2  17).  A  few years  later  the  pro-Athenians  were  expelled  and  found refuge  in  Athens  (IG ii\u00b2  24,  33;Dem.  20.61;  cf.  Osborne ( 1981\u00ad83)  ii. 48\u00ad57).  But  in  c. 375  the  Thasians  joined  the Second  Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.4:[ ]). Philip  II  gained  control  of  Thasos  in  (probably)  340/39  with the  help  of  Thasian  supporters  (Dem. 18.197).  The  Thasians belonged  to  the  League  of  Corinth  in  338  (IG ii\u00b2 236.b.5  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 403). Thasian  presbeis  in  Athens  (no. 361)  are  attested  in  C 4e (IG ii\u00b2  24.b.16),  and  in  the  same  period  Thasians  are  hon- oured  with  Athenian  citizenship  (IG ii\u00b2  17).  The  Thasians granted  proxenia  to  a  citizen  from  an  unknown  polis  (IG xii suppl. 352  (C 4l))  and  to  a  citizen  from  Olynthos  (no. 588) (\u00c9t.  Thas. 5  p. 223  no. 376  (C 4l/C3e)),  and  Thasians  were granted  proxenia  by Athens  (IG ii\u00b2  6  (C 5l/C4e),  with Walbank  ( 1978)  324\u00ad28  no. 61  (doubts  about  the  identity  of the  family  as  Thasian)  and  Grandjean  and  Salviat  ( 1988)). Thasian  theorodokoi  are  recorded  as  hosts  of  theoroi  from the  aegean  779 Epidauros  (no. 348)  in  359  (IG iv\u00b2.194.31)  and  as  hosts  of  the- oroi  from  Argos  (no. 347)  in  c. 330  (SEG 23  189.ii.20).  The Thasians  gave  the  Athenians  a  gold  crown  in  354/3  (IG ii\u00b2 1437.10\u00ad11,  1438.15\u00ad16). Many  public  enactments  are  known  from  Thasos.  There are  several  wine  laws.  The  earliest  dates  from  c. 460  (SEG 36 790  Koerner  ( 1993)no.  66);  later  parts  belong  to  C 5l  and C 4e  (IG xii  suppl. 347.i\u00adii  Koerner  ( 1993)  nos. 68\u00ad69;  cf. SEG 36  791  and  Salviat  ( 1986)).  A  law  regulating  the  cleanli- ness  of  the  streets  was  passed  in  the  480\u00ad460s  (SEG 42 785  Duch\u00eane  ( 1992);  cf.  Graham  ( 1998)  with  Gauthier  in  BE ( 1999)  428).A  law  on  commerce  of 425\u00ad415  regulated  exports and  imposed  fines ( SEG 36  792  Koerner  ( 1993)no.  67).  The revolutionary  government  of 411\u00ad408  established  rewards  for informers  in  the  last  years  of  the  Peloponnesian  War  (ML 83  Koerner  ( 1993)no.70).A  decree  of  C 5l/C4e  set  up  funer- ary  honours  for  those  who  died  for  the  fatherland  (Pouilloux ( 1954)  371\u00ad80  no. 141).  A  law  set  out  conditions  for  accepting foreigners  into  the  civic  body  of  Thasos  soon  after  the  end  of the  Peloponnesian  War  (IG xii.8264  Koerner  ( 1993)no.  71, pace  Pouilloux  ( 1954)  204\u00ad13).  A  sacred  law  of  C 5m  regulated a  cult  of  Herakles  (IG xii  suppl. 414  Duch\u00eane  ( 1992)  124\u00ad25 no. 23);  another,  dated  (perhaps  over-precisely?)  to  430\u00ad420, deals  with  a  cult  instituted  by  an  individual  (SEG 38  853).  A law  from  C 4l  seems  to  give  a  complete  list  of  the  city's  festivals (SEG 17  415;  Salviat  ( 1958b)). At  least  from  C 5l  on,  public  enactments  were  passed  by  the boule  and/or  the  demos.  The  only  preserved  attestation  is  a  law about  naturalisation  passed  in  C 5l  by the  boule,  with  a  major amendment  passed  by  the  demos  (IG xii.8264  Koerner ( 1993)no.  71).  For  a  C 4l  example  of  a  decision  presumably made  by  (boule  and)  demos,see IG xii  suppl. 352.5. Lists  of  theoroi  beginning  about  C 6m  (IG xii.8273\u00ad330, 283,  285)  refer  to  the  government  of  the  Three  Hundred  and Sixty  (IG xii.8  276.5\u00ad7  (rC 6l));  this  may  be  a  boule,  with  a member  for  every  day  of  the  year  (Salviat  ( 1979)).  The  wine law  of  C 5f(SEG  36  790.8),  the  denunciation  law  of  C 5l  (ML 83.3)  and  a  C 5l  decision  about  confiscation of  property (IG xii.8263.7)  all  mention  a  board  of  \"Three  Hundred\",  pre- sumably  a  lawcourt  (ML  p. 264;Koerner ( 1993)  246,  264). The  usual  Thasian  eponymous  official was the archon, who  served  with  two  colleagues  (ML  83.i.6;  SEG 38 851.B.22\u00ad23  (both  C 5l));  many  fragments  of  archon  lists  sur- vive,  starting  in  C 6  (but  inscribed  in  C 4):  Pouilloux  ( 1954) 259\u00ad75  nos. 28\u00ad34  and  Dunant  and  Pouilloux  ( 1957)  nos. 199\u00ad220  with  p. 104;  Sherk  ( 1990)  292\u00ad94).  But  during  the period  of  Athenian  domination  from  463,  only  a  single archon  served  (Salviat  ( 1984)  243\u00ad46).  In  397  the  Spartan Lichas  occupied  the  office (Salviat ( 1983)).  The  theoroi appear  also  occasionally  as  eponymous  officials ( IG xii.8 263.a.1  ( 412/11)).  The  archons  forming  a  board  of  unknown number  attested  by  c. 480\u00ad460  are  not  to  be  confused  with the  eponymous  officials ( SEG 42  785.27;  Duch\u00eane  ( 1992) 64\u00ad68).Inscriptions  provide  evidence  of  a  raft  of  public  offi- cials,  including  polemarchoi  (Pouilloux  ( 1954)  371\u00ad80  no. 141 (c. 400)),  theoroi  (IG xii.8263  (C 5l)),  prostatai  (IG xii.8 264.13  Koerner  ( 1993)no.  71,  with  Pouilloux  ( 1954) 204\u00ad13),  a  grammateus,  once  called  \"of  the  boule\"(IG xii.8 264.13  Koerner  ( 1993)no.  71  with  Pouilloux  ( 1954)  204\u00ad13, 371\u00ad80  no. 141  (c. 400)),  agoranomoi  and  gynaikonomoi (Pouilloux  ( 1954)  371\u00ad80  no. 141  (c. 400);  Salviat  ( 1958a) 319\u00ad23  no. 1  (C 4)),and  epistatai  (SEG 42  785.29\u00ad30;  Duch\u00eane ( 1992)  68\u00ad71).  Apologoi  are  known  from  dedications (Bernard  and  Salviat  ( 1962)  no. 10=Duch^ene  (1992)  124  no. 23;  Salviat  ( 1957)).  Karpologoi  appear  in  the  famous  law  on commerce  (SEG 36  792.2,  9  with  Pouilloux  ( 1954)  121\u00ad34, date: 425\u00ad415). Inscriptions  of  C 5l\u00adC4e  attest  to  groups  designated  by plural  patronymic  names:  e.g. (Rolley  ( 1965) 441\u00ad42  no. 1).  They  are  usually  identified w ith  the   known  from  C 3  grants  of  citizenship  (IG xii  suppl. 355.4) and  are  interpreted  by  Jones,  POAG 184\u00ad86  as  civic  sub- divisions  of  an  \"essentially  private  nature\".  He  argues  too that  one  of  the  groups,  the  (Rolley  ( 1965)  449  no. 8),  was  in  fact  not  a  patra  but  a  larger  subdivision,  possibly  a phyle,  contra  Grandjean  and  Salviat  ( 2000)  221. Many  communal  cults  and  sanctuaries  are  attested  for Thasos  (brief  surveys  in  Schachter  ( 1992)  22\u00ad25;  Cole  ( 1995) 309\u00ad12).  From  the  earliest  written  records  we  can  see  that Thasos  was  not  identified w ith  a  single  primary  divinity,  but with  a  constellation  of  divinities  who  catered  to  the  needs  of the  community.  Four  of  these  divinities--Artemis (Hekate), Herakles, Apollo  (Pythios)  and  Athena (Poliouchos)--seem t o  have  been  more  prominent  than others.  Thasos  therefore  had  not  one  major  sanctuary,  but four.  Apollo  Pythios  and  Athena  Poliochos  were  located  on the  double  summit,  and  Artemis  and  Herakles  in  the  lower area  (Cole  ( 1995)  310).  ( 1)  Artemis,  whose  Artemision (Hippoc.  Epid. 3.17 ) was begun in C6s (Grandjean and Salviat  ( 2000)  89\u00ad91),was  sometimes  known  by  various  epi- thets,  including  Hekate  (SEG 42  785.49  (C 5f)).  ( 2)  Herakles sometimes  bore  the  epithet  Thasios  (IG xii  suppl. 414);  he  is attested  in  C 6l  as  one  of  the  protective  divinities  of  Thasos (IG xii.8  264.16,  351.3);  his  cult  was  supposed  to  have  been founded  by  the  Phoenicians,  and  his  temple  existed  by 480\u00ad460  (Hdt. 2.44.4;  Hippoc.  Epid. 3.17 ;  Polyaen.  Strat. 780 reger 1.45.4;  Paus. 5.25.12\u00ad13;  SEG 42  785.2,  23\u00ad24  (C 5f);  IG xii suppl. 412  =  CEG i  416  (C 6);  IG xii  suppl. 350  (C 5);  cf. Grandjean  and  Salviat  ( 2000)  142\u00ad45;  Launey  ( 1944)).  ( 3) Apollo  Pythios  (SEG 36  790.6  (C 5f)  (restored);  SEG 42 785.9)  was  worshipped  in  the  Pythion,  which  is  attested  epi- graphically  in  C 4  (IG xii  suppl. 350  (C 4))  and  has  produced sherds  of 525\u00ad500  (Grandjean  and  Salviat  ( 1995);cf.also  SEG 45  1205;  Grandjean  and  Salviat  ( 2000)  111\u00ad12).  ( 4)  Athena  is attested  as  Poliochos  from  C 5f(SEG  36  790.6);  her  sanctuary dominated  the  acropolis  (Grandjean  and  Salviat  ( 2000) 114\u00ad16).  Finally,  Dionysos  is  attested  alongside  Herakles  as  a protective  divinity  of  Thasos  (IG xii.8356  (C 6l),  262.16;  IG xii  suppl. 398  (C 4));  the  earliest  archaeological  remains  of his  sanctuary  are  C 4  (Grandjean  and  Salviat  ( 2000)  92\u00ad94), but  it  is  attested  by  Hippokrates  by  C 5s  (Hippoc.  Epid. 1.21) public  enactments  were  sometimes  inscribed  there  (IG  xii.8 262.16\u00ad17),  and  dramatic  festivals  connected  with  Dionysos are  attested  in  inscriptions  (SEG 38  851.A.17  (C 5l);  IG xii suppl. 354.a.21\u00ad22  (c. 300)). Other  gods  worshipped  by  the  Thasians  included  Hera, who  had  a  sanctuary  by  C 5e,  though  it  has  not  yet  been located  (Hippoc.  Epid. 1.14).  Zeus  is  attested  with  various epithets,  as  Zeus  Katharsios  (Pouilloux  ( 1954)no.  101  with LSCG  suppl.  p. 124  (C 4))  and  Zeus  Agoraios,  who  had  a sanctuary  dating  from  C 4e  (BCH 74  ( 1950)  333\u00ad41;  Pouilloux ( 1954)  230\u00ad31  with  IG xii.8  361;  Grandjean  and  Salviat ( 2000)  76).  Zeus  also  served,  under  three  different  epithets, as  patron  deity  of  three  of  the  Thasian  patrai:  Zeus  Alastos, Zeus  Ktesios  and  Zeus  Patroios,  along  with  Athena  Mykesis and  Athena  Patroia  (IG xii  suppl. 407  (c. 400);  Rolley  ( 1965); Grandjean  and  Salviat  ( 2000)  102\u00ad5).  Poseidon  had  a  sanc- tuary  dating  from  C 5e/C4s  (IG xii  suppl. 432  (C 4);  Bon  and Seyrig  ( 1929);  Grandjean  and  Salviat  ( 2000)  97\u00ad98). Demeter  Thesmophoros  had  her  sanctuary  the Thesmophorion  (Paus. 10.28.3  (rC 7);  Rolley  ( 1965);  M\u00fcller ( 1996);  Grandjean  and  Salviat  ( 2000)  102\u00ad5).Pan  had  a  sanc- tuary  (IG xii  suppl. 429;  Grandjean  and  Salviat  ( 2000) 117\u00ad19).  The  Charites'  sanctuary  was  in  place  by  480\u00ad460 (SEG 42  785.41;  Duch\u00eane  ( 1992)  75\u00ad77,  93\u00ad94;  Berranger ( 1992)  184\u00ad203).  An  Asklepieion  is  also  attested  (Salviat ( 1958c)).  Hippokrates  mentions  a  temple  of  Ge  (Epid. 3.1a). Among  the  cults  of  heroes  may  be  mentioned  the  Mnema of  Glaukos,  which  was  located  in  the  corner  of  the  agora;  the inscription  which  identifies it dates t o  c. 600  (Pouilloux ( 1955);  Grandjean  and  Salviat  ( 2000)  69\u00ad70;  cf.  also  Jeffery ( 1990)  300\u00ad1).  Infamously,  the  Thasians  wanted  to  establish a  cult  for  Agesilaos  in  394,  though  he  refused  (Plut.  Mor. 210C\u00adD). The  Thasians  are  known  as  a  community  to  have  consult- ed  Apollo  at  Delphi  twice  in  C 5  (Paus. 6.11.7\u00ad9).  They  made a  communal  dedication  of  a  statue  of  Herakles  at  Olympia after  their  liberation  from  the  Persians  in  479/8  (Paus. 5.25.12\u00ad13).  Thanks  to  Pausanias  ( 6.11.2\u00ad9),  we  know  a  good deal  about  the  athlete-hero  Theogenes,  whose  cult  had begun  by  the  start  of  C 4.  His  victories  included  two  in  the Olympic  Games  (in  480  and 476:  Olympionikai 201  and 215), ten  in  the  Isthmian,  nine  in  the  Nemean,  and  three  in  the Pythian  (Pouilloux  ( 1994)  with  the  other  sources;  on  the date  of  SEG 18  359  as 346,see  Holzman  ( 1994)  152;  Grandjean and  Salviat  ( 2000)  73\u00ad76);  statues  of  him  were  erected  at Delphi  (Syll. \u00b336A;  Jacquemin  ( 1999)  354  no. 459)  and Olympia  (Syll. \u00b336B). The  Thasian  calendar  was  of  the  Ionian  type  and  was  vir- tually  identical  with  that  of  Paros  (Salviat  ( 1992)  263; Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 65\u00ad72). The  city  itself,  at  the  north-east  corner  of  the  island,  was oriented  towards  the  sea  and  exploited  the  natural  land- scape,  rising  gradually  on  a  series  of  terraces  to  a  striking  and steep  acropolis.  There  were  two  major  centres.  The  lower city  developed  around  the  agora  and  harbour.  To  the  south, the  upper  city  was  organised  around  the  acropolis.  The major  sanctuaries  determined  the  pattern  of  settlement  and the  orientation  of  major  streets.  There  were two  primary areas  of  habitation:  one  near  the  Artemision,  the  other  near the  Herakleion  (Grandjean  ( 1988)  i. 312\u00ad23,  336\u00ad46). In C 6l  the  city  was  surrounded  by  a  defence  circuit (Grandjean  and  Salviat  ( 2000)  94\u00ad139)  with  gates  named after  specific divinities ( IG xii.8356;  Picard  ( 1962)).  The walls  enclosed  an  area  of  almost  70  ha.  Following  the  attack of  Histiaios  in  494,  the  Thasians  used  their  great  wealth  to strengthen  their  existing  fortification walls (Hdt. 6.46.2).  In 491  Dareios  ordered  these  walls  to  be  torn  down  and  the Thasian  fleet c onveyed  to  Abdera  (Hdt. 6.46.1).  These  walls must  have  been  rebuilt  (or  perhaps  the  order  was  never  fully carried  out),  for  the  Thasian  urban  centre  was  fortified in 463,  when  the  Athenians  ordered  the  walls  to  be  torn  down again  after  the  Thasian  Revolt  (Thuc. 1.101.3).  In  411  the Thasians  rebuilt  their  walls  (Thuc. 8.64.3).  These  walls  are mentioned  in  an  inscription  of  C 4l\u00adC3e  (\u00c9t.  Thas. 5  223  no. 376  Maier  ( 1959\u00ad61)  no. 55),  and  ruins  of  them,  with  gates and  towers,  are  still  to  be  seen  in  the  city  (Grandjean  and Salviat  ( 1999),  ( 1995),  ( 1990),  ( 1993)). Thasian  public  architecture  included  a  prytaneion,  attest- ed  as  early  as  C 5f(SEG  42  785.43\u00ad44)  and  frequently  there- after  (IG xii.8262.1  (C 5l);  restored,  see  SEG 38  851);  Theophr. De  Odoribus 51;  cf.  S.  G.  Miller  ( 1978)  no. 439;  Duch\u00eane the  aegean  781 ( 1992)  98\u00ad99).The  theatre  claimed  by  Grandjean  and  Salviat ( 2000)  105  after  Hippoc.  Epid. 1.20  seems  to  be  a  misreading; Arist.  Poet. 1448a12  attests  to  a  Thasian  actor,  but  this  does not  prove  that  a  pre-Hellenistic  theatre  existed  on  Thasos; the  earliest  evidence  seems  to  be  I.Lampsakos 1.21  (c. 300),  IG xii  suppl. 354.a.21\u00ad2  (c. 300)  and  the  Hellenistic  archaeolog- ical  remains  (TGR  ii. 303\u00ad4).  By  C 5f  Thasos  had  an  agora (Grandjean  ( 1988)  480\u00ad85;  Duch\u00eane  ( 1992)  101\u00ad4; Grandjean  and  Salviat  ( 2000)  62\u00ad64;  for  an  \"agora  of  liars\", see  Hippoc.  Epid. 3  cases 8  and 12).  From  C 4m  the  agora  was flanked w ith  stoas,  and  in  the  north-eastern  corner  was  a building  of  C 4l  with  offices for magistrates (Grandjean and Salviat  ( 2000)  62\u00ad71).  Most  extraordinary  is  the  epigraphic attestation  of  a  building  called  the  \u00b5  in c. 480\u00ad460,  where  Thasian  civic  officials o versaw  the exchange  and  circulation  of  money  (Duch\u00eane  ( 1992)  19\u00ad20 ll. 41\u00ad42,  79\u00ad85).  Next  to  it  stood  a  \u00b5  (Duch\u00eane ( 1992)  19\u00ad20  ll. 41\u00ad42,pp.  79\u00ad85).  Thasos  had  two  harbours, one  of  which  is  described  as  (Ps.-Skylax  67).  The Thasians  had  military  facilities  for  their  ships  by  c. 500 (Grandjean  and  Salviat  ( 2000)  52\u00ad57). We  know  a  fair  amount  about  settlement  patterns  in  the Thasian  countryside,  thanks  in  part  to  a  remarkable  inscrip- tion  found  at  Aliki  (see  infra)  which  gives  directions  and  dis- tances  around  the  island  (Salviat  and  Servais  ( 1964)).  The inscription  mentions  two  places.  The  first from the city (polis), ,was known already from Herodotos in con- nection  with  the  Thasian  mines  ( 6.47.2)  and  must  be  a region  rather  than  a  village  (Salviat  and  Servais  ( 1964)  282 with  n. 1;  which  is  not  to  say  that  there  might  not  also  have been  a  settlement  with  the  same  name).  The  other  is  called       \u00b5,  which  was  a  sanctuary  of Zeus  located  at  a  place,  probably  a  settlement,  called Demetrion  (ibid. 285);  if  this  place  has  been  rightly  located, the  village's  god  will have been  Apollo  Komaios  (ibid. 287). Koinyra  (Hdt. 6.47.2)  was  a  village  with  mines  nearby  (Barr. C).  The  modern  village  of  Aliki  lies  at  the  site  of  an  ancient settlement  with  a  sanctuary  that  began  in  C 7m,  soon  after the  Parian  colonisation  of  the  island;  Grandjean  and  Salviat ( 2000)  161\u00ad68),  and  of  important  marble  mines  that  began to  be  exploited  in  C 6  (Barr.  AC).  Remains  of  a  Classical  set- tlement  have  been  found  at  modern  Koukos,  near  the  south- ern  tip  of  the  island  (Barr.  C).  The  name  may derive  from  the  Thasian  river  Angros  (Hdt. 4.49.2  with  L. Robert ( 1938)  201\u00ad2).  The  mines  and  quarries  found  in many  places  on  the  island  were  exploited  from  at  least  C 6 (Muller  ( 1979);  des  Courtils  et al.( 1982);  Weisgerber  and Wagner ( 1988a),  ( 1988b);  Sodini  et al.( 1980)).  The  remains of  many  towers  no  doubt  represent  farmsteads  (Bon  ( 1930); Osborne  ( 1986)),  but  there  is  also  a  lighthouse  (pharos)  con- structed  in  C 6e  in  memory  of  Akeratos  (IG xii.8683  with Kozelj and Wurch-Kozelj ( 1989)).  Ateliers  of  amphoras  con- tinue  to  be  found  throughout  the  Thasian  countryside (Garlan  ( 1999)  2\u00ad4). The  Thasians  struck  silver  coins  on  the  so-called Thrako\u00adMakedonian  standard  from  C 6l  (perhaps  first in 520\u00ad510)  up  until  C 5l.  It  is  hard  to  find m uch  sign  of  the defeat  of  the  Thasians  by  the  Athenians  on  Thasian  coinage (Duch\u00eane  ( 1992)  87).  The  coins  have  been  sorted  into  three general  groups  on  the  basis  of  variations  in  details  of  the types,  especially  in  the  appearance  of  the  maenad;  the  date of  the  groups  is  imprecise,  but  they  fall  roughly  in  order from  C 6l/C5e  through  C 5  to  perhaps  412\u00ad404  for  the  third group.  Types:  obv.  satyr/Silenos  with  a  maenad  (stater,  trite), or  satyr  alone  (hemihekte),  or  head  of  satyr  (hekte),  or  two dolphins  (quarter  hekte),  or  dolphin  (eighth  hekte);  rev. incuse  square  (all  denominations).  Anepigraphic  till  C 5e, when  legends  appear: (hekte), (hemi- hekte), (quarter  and  eighth  hekte).  After  an  apparent pause  in  minting  ( 404\u00ad391),  a  new  coinage  on  a  new  system (but  the  same  standard)  starts  (probably)  in  390,  with  the return  of  democracy  to  Thasos,  and  runs  to  c. 335;some modifications w ere  introduced  c. 360.  The  new  coinage includes  issues  in  gold  and  bronze  along  with  silver. Denominations  now  include  tetradrachms  and  drachms (replacing  the  old  trite  of  the  stater)  in  gold  and  silver; dichalkons,  triobols,  hemiobols  and  chalkous  in  bronze. Types:  obv.  Dionysos,  bearded  or  juvenile  (gold,  silver),  or head  of  Herakles  (bronze);  rev.  Herakles  as  archer;  legend: (gold,  silver),  or  Silenos  with  kantharos  or amphora  (gold),  or  Herakles'  symbols  (bow,  club,  star);  leg- end: (bronze;  Pouilloux  ( 1954)  216\u00ad17;  Picard ( 1982),  ( 1987);  Duch\u00eane  ( 1992)  85\u00ad87;  Grandjean  and  Salviat ( 2000)  303\u00ad9;  SNG  Cop.

Ps.-Skylax 99  places  Nisyros  in  Karia,  but  Steph.  Byz. 477.7 among  the  Kyklades.  The  small  islands  off  Nisyros  (Strabo 10.5.16)  were  part  of  its  territory.  The  island  was  supposed  to have  been  created  when  Poseidon  ripped  off  part  of  Kos  and threw  it  into  the  sea  (Paus. 1.2.4;Strabo 10.5.16;Apollod. Bibl. 1.6.2.4),  a  foundation  myth  reflected in the t rident  on the  C 4  coins  (infra).  Nisyros  is  said  to  have  been  colonised  by Epidauros  (no. 348)  (Hdt. 7.99.2\u00ad3).  Kos  (no. 497)  may  have controlled  the  island  of  Nisyros  c. 500  (Hdt. 7.99  with  Hicks in  Paton  and  Hicks  ( 1891)  p.  xii);  but  if  so,  Nisyros  was  inde- pendent  by c. 478  (see  infra).  Two  ships  from  Nisyros  fought under  Artemisia's  command  at  Salamis  (Hdt. 7.99.2). Nisyros  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Ionian  district  (IG i\u00b3  269.i.8),but  in  429/8  to  the  Island district  (IG i\u00b3  282.iii.20)  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists from  452/1  (IG i\u00b3  261.iv.4)  to  428/7  (IG i\u00b3  283.ii.30)  a  total  of the  aegean  763 nine  times,  twice  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1 tal. 3,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  261.iv.4),  reduced  to  1  tal.  in  or  before 442/1  (IG i\u00b3  270.i.9).After  the  end  of  the  Peloponnesian  War Nisyros  fell  under  Spartan  authority,  for  in  394  Diodorus mentions  the  island  among  the  states  brought  by Pharnabazos  and  Konon  to  revolt  ( 14.83.3).  Throughout  C 4 Nisyros  was  independent  (see  Papachristodoulou  ( 1989) 47). The  protective  deity,  appropriately  for  a  volcanic  island (see  Buchholz  and  Althaus  ( 1982)  17\u00ad18,  21\u00ad22),  was  proba- bly  Poseidon  (see  the  coins;  Ashton  ( 1999a)  23  with  ( 1999b) for  the  Knidian  comparanda);  in  a  Hellenistic  inscription  he bears  the  epithet  Argeios  (IG xii.3103.13  Syll. \u00b3673).Strabo mentions  a  sanctuary  of  Poseidon  (Strabo  10.5.16). A  remarkable  law  of  C 4s,  inscribed  on  the  outside  of  the city  wall,  declares  that  land  lying  5  feet  from  the  wall  is  pub- lic  land  ( \u00b5 ) (IG  xii.386  Syll. \u00b3 936  Maier  ( 1959\u00ad61)  no. 47)).  The  remains  of  the  wall  date at  the  earliest  from  after  the  earthquake  of 413  (Buchholtz and  Althaus  ( 1982)  15\u00ad16;  see  Bean  and  Cook  ( 1957)  118\u00ad19); it  has  been  suggested  to  have  been  put  up  as  part  of Mausolos'  strategy  of  fortifying  sites  under  his  control (Bean  and  Cook  ( 1957)  142;  Hornblower  ( 1982)  331\u00ad32; Sherwin-White  ( 1978)  70  n. 212  is  sceptical).  The  wall enclosed  an  area  of 10  ha  (Hoepfner  ( 1999)  134\u00ad35).  A  har- bour  is  attested  at  Ps.-Skylax  99. In C 4  Nisyros  struck  coins  in  silver  and  bronze.

Pholegandros  is  not  called  a  polis  in  any  source,  but deserves  inclusion  as  being  probably  a  polis  because  ( 1) Solon  (fr. 2)  mentions  the  possibility  that,  changing  his patris,  he  might  become  a  Pholegandrios  or  a  Sikinites instead  of  an  Athenaios;  ( 2)  because  the  island  was  a  paying member  of  the  Delian  League  (infra);  and  ( 3)  because  we possess  a  C 4  proxeny  decree  passed  by  the  Pholegandrians; for  the  date,  see  Brun  ( 1996)  299.  The  collective  form  of  the city-ethnic  appears  internally  in  the  proxeny  decree  (IG xii.5 9.15)  and  externally  in  the  Solonian  poem  (fr. 2). Steph.  Byz. 669.17  assigns  the  island  to  the  Sporades. Pholegandros  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Island  district,  but  is  absent  from  the  full panel  of 441/0  (IG i\u00b3  271.i\u00adii.88\u00ad101).It  was  assessed  for  trib- ute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.87)  for  2,000  dr.  and  is  recorded  in  the tribute  lists  in  417/16  (IG i\u00b3  288.i.7)  and  416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.25) paying  a  phoros  of 1,000  dr.

What  we  know  about  the  political  institutions  comes from  a  C 4  proxeny  decree  for  a  citizen  of  Ios  (no. 484),  to be set  up  in  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo  Pythios  on  Ios  where  the stone  was  found.

Seriphos  is  called  a  polis  both in  the  urban  sense  (Ps.-Skylax  58)  and  in  the  political  sense (Isoc. 19.9),  and  in  the  accounts  of  the  Delian  amphiktyones the  Seriphians  are  recorded  under  the  heading  (I.D\u00e9los 98A.12  IG ii\u00b2  1635  ( 377/6\u00ad375/4)).  The collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in abbreviated  form  on  C 3  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2490)  and  exter- nally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  262.i.20)  and  as  the title  of  a  comedy  by  Kratinos  (Cratinus,  PCG  frr. 218\u00ad32). For  the  individual  and  external  use,  see  the  Karthaian  C 4m list  of  proxenoi,  of  whom  at  least  one  is  a  citizen  of  Seriphos (IG xii.5542.48),and  Plato's  report  of  the  exchange  of  words between  Themistokles  and  an  unnamed  Seriphian  (Pl.  Resp. 329E;  Plut.  Them. 18.3). Stephanos  assigns  the  island  to  the  Sporades,  whereas Strabo  10.5.3,  quoting  Artemidoros,  assigns  it  to  the Kyklades.  Seriphos  was  considered  a  small  polis,  and  its almost  proverbial  insignificance is r eflected in several sources  (Pl.  Resp. 329E\u00ad330A;  Isoc. 19.9;Stob.  Flor. 3.39.29); for  the  ancient  (and  modern)  insignificance of  Seriphos,  see Brun ( 1993a). Seriphos  was  allegedly  colonised  by  Ionians  from  Athens (Hdt. 8.48).  In  490  the  Seriphians  refused  the  Persian demand  to surrender,  and  Seriphos  fought  on  the  Greek  side in  the  Persian  War,  contributing  one  ship  (Hdt. 8.46.4,  48). Seriphos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League  and  probably among  the  original  members  (ATL  iii. 198).  It  belonged  to the  Island  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from 451/0  (IG i\u00b3  262.i.20)  to  416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.11)  a  total  of  four- teen  times,  twice  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 2 tal.  in  451/0  (IG i\u00b3  262.i.20)  but  1  tal.  in  all  subsequent  years (IG i\u00b3  264.iv.2).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3 71.i.76)  for 2  tal.  Seriphos  may  have  been  a  member  of  the the  aegean  771 Second  Athenian  Naval  League  (I.D\u00e9los 98A.12;  Cargill ( 1981)  37;  but  see  Dreher  ( 1995)  24.1,  245\u00ad47).  In  C 4s Seriphos  had  a  theorodokos  to  host  theoroi  from  Nemea (SEG 36  331.A.11\u00ad13  ( 331/0\u00ad313)). There  are  virtually  no  remains  of  the  ancient  town  of Seriphos,  which  lay  beneath  modern  Seriphos  (cf.  BCH 119 ( 1995)  998).  The  temenos  of  Perseus  and  altars  of  Diktys  and Klymene  which  Pausanias  says  were  erected  by  the Athenians  ( 2.18.1)  perhaps  belong  to  C 5. Seriphos  apparently  minted  staters  in  C 6  on  the Aiginetan  standard  with  a  frog  on  the  obverse;  see  IGCH  no. 4  and  Erxleben  ( 1970)  73. 518.

Solon  refers  to it  by  implication  as  a  patris  (fr. 2.2).  The  collective use  of  the city-ethnic  appears  internally  on  C 3  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2491) and  in  a  proxeny  decree  of  C 4l  (IG xii  suppl. 177.2,  5)  and externally  in  inscriptions  (IG i\u00b3  287.i.16;  IG ii\u00b2  43.B.31)  and in  literature  (Solon  fr. 2.1). Sikinos  is  usually  placed  among  the  Kyklades  (Lauffer ( 1989)  614),but  Steph.  Byz. 568.17,citing  Strabo  ( 10.5.1),calls it  \"an  island  by  Krete\".  Apart  from  the  urban  centre  at  mod- ern  Ag.  Marina,  no  other  settlements  are  known. Sikinos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.

It  is  absent  from  the  full panel  of 441/0  (IG i\u00b3  271.i\u00adii.89\u00ad101).It  was  assessed  for  trib- ute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.90)  for  1,000  dr.  Sikinos  joined  the Second  Athenian  Naval  League  in  the  370s  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.31). Sikinos  awarded  proxenia  and  other  benefits t o  a  citizen  of Athens  (no. 361)  (IG xii  suppl. 177  (C 4l))  and  to one  of  Paros (no. 509)  (IG xii.524  (C 4l/C3e)).  Our  only  source for  the political  institutions  is  the  proxeny  decree  for  the  Parian  (IG xii.524).  Decrees  were  passed  by  the  boule  and  the  demos  (ll. 2\u00ad3;  cf.  ll. 12\u00ad13);  they  were  published  by  a  board  of  archontes (ll. 19\u00ad20)  and  set  up  in  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo  Pythios  (l. 18)  at  the  expense  of  a  board  of  praktores  (l. 21). For  the  urban  centre,  walls  and  an  agora  are  mentioned (Lauffer  ( 1989)  614\u00ad15),  but  the  remains  have  not  been  stud- ied  carefully. 519.

Kos  Meropis  is  called  a  polis  in the  urban  sense  by  Thucydides  at  8.41.2.  The  eponymous office may have been a board of  prostatai  (Iscr.  Cos  ED 272 with  Pugliese  Carratelli  ( 1957)  335  n. 3,  a decree  of  C 4f  dated  []) who continued t o  play  an  important  role in  the  Koan  polity  after  366  (see  Iscr.

The  urban  centre  seems  to  have  been  located  at  modern Chora.  The  later  site  of  the  Asklepieion  was  occupied  in  C 5 by  a  sanctuary  of  Apollo  Kyparissios  overseen  by  a  board  of \u00b5  \u00b5  (Herzog  ( 1928)  32\u00ad33  no. 11.8\u00ad9). A  sacred  law  forbade  the  cutting  down  of  cypress  trees  in  the temenos  except  for  public  need  (Herzog  ( 1928)  32  no. 11);  this law  was  strengthened  after  the  metoikismos  and  the  estab- lishment  of  Asklepios  in  the  sanctuary  (see  supra).  The  site had  a  temple  of  Demeter  and  a  sacred  spring  (dating  not clear).  Kos  Meropis  was  unfortified in  412  (Thuc. 8.41.2)  but was  fortified b y  Alkibiades  in  the  following  year  (Thuc. 8.108.2).  Remains  of  a  fortification wall have been identified with  that  mentioned  by  Thucydides  (Kantzia  ( 1988)  182; Bean  and  Cook  ( 1957)  121,  followed  by  Pugliese  Carratelli ( 1963\u00ad64)  148). It  has  been  suggested  from  time  to  time  that  Kos  may  have hosted  other  poleis  as  well  (Sherwin-White  ( 1978)  63),  and certainly  every  deme  attested  from  after  the  metoikismos  is  a potential  candidate  for  being  seen  as  such  a  polis.  The  men- tion  in  Ps.-Hippoc.

Thera  was  regarded  as  one  of  the  Kyklades  (Thuc. 2.9.4); for  Strabo  it  is  one  of  the  islands  near  Crete  ( 10.5.1).  The names  of  a  number  of  smaller  settlements  around  Thera  are known,  and  some  of  them  have  been  located  and  explored archaeologically.  Oia  (IG xii.3  suppl. 1291.10)  shows  traces  of settlement  from  the  Archaic  period  to  the  end  of  Antiquity (see  especially  IG xii.3526),  and  Eleusis  has  produced  evi- dence  of  settlement  from  the  Classical  period  (Hiller  von Gaertringen  ( 1899\u00ad1909)  i. 299\u00ad308).  There  may  have  been  a settlement  of  Archaic  and  Classical  date  at  modern  Perissa (Sperling  ( 1973)  30\u00ad31). Thera  was  generally  recognised  to  be  a  colony  of  Sparta (no. 345)  under  the  oecist  Theras  (Hdt. 4.147\u00ad49;  Pind.  Pyth. 4.251\u00ad59  and 5.72\u00ad76;  Paus. 3.1.7\u00ad8,  cf.  IG xii.3382  (C 4); Malkin  ( 1994)  89\u00ad111);  in  C 4f  Akesandros  claimed  that  the oecist  was  called  Samos  and  that  a  descendant  called Aristoteles  led  the  colony  to  Kyrene  (no. 1028)  ((FGrHist 469)  fr. 5a).  The  early  and  better  version  attributes  the  foun- dation  of  Kyrene,  around  631,to  Battos  (Hdt. 4.150\u00ad58;  Pind. Pyth. 4.4\u00ad8,  5.85\u00ad95;ML  5;  see  Malkin  ( 1987)  60\u00ad69;  on  the oath  in  ML  5,  see  now  Dobias-Lalou  ( 1994),  who  argues  that the  text  was  Theraian).  In  Herodotos'  version,  it  was  a  severe and  prolonged  drought  that  drove  the  Therans  to  consult Apollo  at  Delphi  and  dispatch  colonists.  Menekles  of  Barka (C 2)  claims  rather  that  stasis  on  Thera  drove  one  of  the  fac- tions  off  the  island,  but  this  may  be  a  reflection of  Hellenistic history  making  or  of  C 4e  problems  on  the  island  ((FGrHist 270)  fr. 6;  cf.  Ager  ( 2001)  107).  The  Therans  at  Kyrene  main- tained  their  identity  separately  from  settlers  from  the Peloponnesos  and  Crete  until  C 6  (Hdt. 4.161.3). Hostile  to  Athens  in  431  (Thuc. 2.9.4),  the  Theraians  are recorded  as  paying  members  of  the  Delian  League  from 430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.ii.54,  completely  restored)  or  429/8  (IG i\u00b3 282.iii.23,  partially  restored)  to  at  least  418/17  (IG i\u00b3  287.i.10) and  possibly  416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.10,  completely  restored). Mattingly  ( 1996)  77  argues  that  IG i\u00b3  282  should  be  dated rather  to 427/6  and  that  Thera  was  added  to  the  Athenian sphere  of  authority  at  that  date.  Thera  belonged  to  the  Island district  and  was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.68)  ( 5 tal.);  cf.  the  decree  of 426/5  (IG i\u00b3  68)  in  which  Thera,  paired with  Samos,  was  denied  the  privilege  of  electing  eklogeis  to collect  the  tribute,  perhaps  as  a  punishment  (IV i\u00b3  68  21\u00ad24). Thera  fell  under  Spartan  hegemony  after  the Peloponnesian  War  and  may  have  continued  to  be  under  that authority  until  Chabrias'  expedition  in  the  Aegean  in  377/6 (Diod. 15.30.5).  Part  of  the  Theraian  state,  [ ]  [ ] \u00b5  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.1\u00ad2),  may  have  joined  the  Second Athenian  Naval  League  in  the  early  370s  (Coleman  and Bradeen  ( 1967);  but  cf.  Cargill  ( 1981)  45\u00ad47:[-  c. 2  -] [ ]  \u00b5),  which  is  restored  in  IG ii\u00b2  as  [ ]  ;  the expression  here  has  recently  been  interpreted  to  reflect stasis on  the  island  between  oligarchic  and  democratic  factions (Ager  ( 2001);  see  infra).  The  Kyrenaians  (no. 1028)  renewed  in C 4f  the  isopoliteia  the  Theraians  had  long  enjoyed  at  Kyrene (ML 5.12\u00ad13  (C 4f)).  The  Theraians  received  grain  from Kyrene  during  the  crisis  of  c. 330\u00ad326  (SEG 92.17;  cf.  Marasco ( 1992)  and  Gasperini  ( 1996)  106  n. 18). As  befits a c olony  of  Sparta  (see  supra),  the  eponymous  offi- cial  on  Thera  was  a  board  of  three  ephoroi  (IG xii.3  336  (C 3  but presumably  to  be  interpreted  retrospectively)).  In  the  Archaic period  Thera  had  a  king  (Hdt. 4.150.2).  From  Arist.  Pol. 1290b11\u00ad14  it  can  be  inferred  that,  in  an  earlier  period,  Thera had  been  an  oligarchy  in  which  citizen  rights  were  restricted  to the  descendants  of  the  original  colonists.  The  presumption  is that  Thera  in  C 4s  had  become  a  democracy.  It  cannot  be established  when  the  constitution  was  changed  from  monar- chy  to  oligarchy  and  from  oligarchy  to  democracy. Recently  stasis  between  oligarchic  and  democratic  fac- tions  has  been  suggested  for  the  370s;  evidence  includes  the restoration  of  [ ]  [ ]  \u00b5  at  IG ii\u00b2  43B.1\u00ad2  (see supra),  the  appearance  of  an  ekklesia  in  an  inscription  of  C 4 (IG xii.3  suppl. 1289,  infra),  and  the  unlikely  assumption that,  in  the  famous  inscription  from  Kyrene  (ML  5),the  polis referred  to in  line  3  is  Thera  and  not  Kyrene  itself;  see  on  all this  Ager  ( 2001)  101\u00ad13,  with  other  arguments;  but  it  is  better to  be  cautious  here  (Dreher  ( 1995)  13\u00ad14  n. 14). There  is  no  basis  for  Gigon's  view  that  the  Aristotelian  col- lection  of  politeiai  included  a  Constitution  of  the  Theraians (no. 62).  Damiorgoi  are  known  from  inscriptions  of  c. 500(?) and  C 4  (IG xii.3450.2\u00ad3,  16\u00ad17;Jeffery ( 1990)  323  for  the  date; IG xii.3  suppl. 1289  (C 4));  the  later  inscription  may  also  attest the  aegean  783 to  an  assembly  ( ) functioning as a court in criminal actions  (IG xii.3  suppl. 1289).Public  enactments  include  a  sac- rificial r egulation  c. 500(?)  apparently  regulating  sacrifice t o Athena  (IG xii.3450  with  Jeffery  ( 1990)  323),  another  of  C 4e (IG xii.3452;LSCG  no. 133;Gialelis  ( 1997)  50\u00ad51  (but  cf.  SEG 45 1104)),and  a  law  regulating  sacrifice t o  the  Mother  of  the  Gods (IG xii.3436  (C 4)).The  Theraians  may  have  had  an  agreement or  treaty  with  the  Athenians  (no. 361)  in  C 4f(IG  ii\u00b2  179c  with Ager ( 2001)  101,  109\u00ad10).  A  Theraian  citizen  received  proxenia from  Arkesine  (no. 472)  (IG xii.76  (C 4)). Theraian  citizens  were  organised  into  phylai  (Hdt. 4.148.1),  obviously  the  three  Dorian  phylai  all  attested  on  the island:  Hylleis  (IG xii.3378  (C 4)),  Dymanes  (IG xii.3377 (C 4),  restored)  and  Pamphyloi  (IG xii.3626  (Roman), abbreviated).  The  seven  choroi  noted  by  Herodotos  ( 4.153) should  perhaps  be  associated  with  the  toponyms  of  Eleusis, Melainai  and  Oia  (so  Jones,  POAG 215\u00ad16). The  patron  deities  were  Zens  Polias  and  Athena  Polias  (IG xii.3  suppl. 1362  (C 5?;  for  the  date,  see  at  IG xii.3427  with  IG xii.3495  (first c entury  ad)  IG xii.3  427  may  also  refer  to Zeus Polias).  Other  communal  cults  included  those  of  Artemis(?) Soteira  (IG xii.3  155a  (no  date))  and  Zeus  Damatrios  (?)  (IG xii.3418  with  Kose  ( 1997);  SEG 45  1105).  A  wide  variety  of deities  is  mentioned  in  rock-cut  inscriptions  of  Archaic  and Classical  date  (IG xii.3  350\u00ad83,  399\u00ad406,  suppl. 1312\u00ad13, 1316\u00ad18).  The  Theraians  consulted  Apollo  at  Delphi  in  con- nection  with  the  founding  of  a  colony  at  Kyrene  (Hdt. 4.155.3; ML 5.10\u00ad11,  24\u00ad25;  cf.  Fontenrose  ( 1978)  283\u00ad85  Q 45\u00ad9,Q51). As  for  the  calendar,  two  months  are  attested  in  C 4,Artamitios and  Hyakinthios  (IG xii.3452  LSCG  no. 133;  IG xii.3436); the  first is known in K yrene  too,  the  second  shows  Thera's  con- nection  with  Lakedaimon  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 186). We  have  no  information  on  whether  Thera  was  walled before  the  Hellenistic  period  (W.  D\u00f6rpfeld  argued  in  favour of  an  early  fortification wall in H iller  von  Gaertringen ( 1899\u00ad1909)  i. 190\u00ad96,  but  withdrew  his  interpretation  of  the evidence  in  iii. 160\u00ad61;  cf.  Sperling  ( 1973)  90);  the  ruins  seen today  date  mostly  from  the  massive  Hellenistic  rebuilding  of the  city  in  connection  with  its  use  as  a  major  Ptolemaic  base (Bagnall  ( 1976)  123\u00ad34).  A  basilike  stoa  (IG xii.3326.18\u00ad20 (second  century  ad))  has  been  thought  \"conceivably  .  .  . archaic\"  (Hansen  and  Fischer-Hansen  ( 1994)  80),  but  was rebuilt  in  any  case  and  dedicated  in  161/60  by  P.  Mummius Sisenna  Rutilianus  (see  now  Dietz  ( 1993));  it  is  possible  that the  original  structure  was  erected  by  or  in  honour  of  the island's  Ptolemaic  hegemons.  A  temple  of  Apollo  Karneios, which  may  have  been  the  chief  archive  of  the  city,  is  known from  c. 600  (Hiller  von  Gaertringen  ( 1899\u00ad1909)  i. 275\u00ad83, iii. 63\u00ad70;  Sperling  ( 1973)  82\u00ad84)  and  one  of  Apollo  Pythios from  C 6  (IG xii.3322.20  (C 2)).  Thera  had  an  agora  of Archaic  and  Classical  date  (Witschel  ( 1997)  24\u00ad25).  A  sanc- tuary  of  Athena  existed  from  at  least  C 5s  at  modern  Skaros (IG xii.3411;  Sperling  ( 1973)  35\u00ad36).  Property  belonging  to the  Mother  of  the  Gods  is  attested  by  an  inscription  of  C 4 (IG xii.3  436;  Sperling  ( 1973)  33\u00ad34). The  island  of  Therasia  lies  opposite  Thera,  across  the flooded caldera of  the  volcano  that  exploded  in  about  1648 to  create  the  topography  of  this  little  archipelago.  (The smaller  islands  in  the  caldera  were  created  by  post-Classical eruptions;  see  Forsyth  ( 1992).)  Although  there  is  some  evi- dence  to  suggest  that  Therasia  had  an  independent  political existence  for  a  time  in  C 3  (an  ethnic  in  IG xi.2120.48  ( 236) with  L.  Robert  ( 1946)  93),  there  is  no  evidence  for  the Archaic  or  Classical  periods  to  suggest  that  it  was  anything more  than  a  dependency  of  Thera  at  best,  or  simply  a  part  of the  territory  of  Thera  at  the  least.  For  the  toponym  Therasia ( ),  see  Strabo  1.3.16,  10.5.1;Plut.  Mor. 399C;  Steph. Byz. 313.18\u00ad20;  Ptol.  Geog. 3.15.28.  Ruins  reported  on  the north-west  part  of  the  island  have  been  associated  with  the polis  of  Ptolemy  ( 3.15.28;  cf.  Sperling  ( 1973)  40\u00ad41). Anepigraphic  silver  staters  of  C 7  on  the  Aiginetan  standard have  sometimes  been  assigned  to  Thera.  Types:  obv.  two dol- phins  swimming  right  and  left;  rev.  incuse  square  (Head  HN \u00b2 480;  Boutin  ( 1986)  1\u00ad6  reasserts  the  attribution;  accepted  by Sheedy  ( 1998a)  321).  Otherwise  Thera  seems  to  have  coined only  in  bronze  starting  in  C 4.  Types:  obv.  head  of  Apollo,  fac- ing  or  in  profile,  or  head  of  Zeus,  or  head  of  Hermes,  or female  head;  rev.  rushing  bull  sometimes  with  dolphins,  or three  dolphins,  or  lyre,  or  fulmen,  or  caduceus;  legend:  or (Head,  HN \u00b2493;  SNG  Cop.

The  toponym  is  vari- ously  reported  as  ,  (IG xii.51076.53  (C 4\u00adC3))  or (Strabo  10.5.6)  or  (IG xii.5  568.10 (C 5)).  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG ii\u00b2  43.82)  or (IG xii.5  568.1  (C 5)).That  Poiessa  is  a  polis  in  the urban  sense  is  implied  by  the  term   at  Ps.-Skylax 58.  It  is  called  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  a  decree  of C 4l\u00adC3e  (IG xii.5570.A7);  for  the  date  see  Brun  ( 1996)  114. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in inscriptions  of  C 5l/C4e  (IG xii.5  568.1,  1100.1)  and  external- ly  in  Athenian  inscriptions  (IG ii\u00b2  43.82).  The  individual  use of  the  city-ethnic  is  unattested. A  text  inscribed  in  stoichedon  strongly  suggests  that  the chief  official was the prytanis  (Mendoni  ( 1989)  295\u00ad96  no. III).  In  C 4l/C3e  decrees  were  passed  by  the  boule  and  the demos;a board of  praktores  is  also  mentioned  (IG xii.5 570.A1,B2).  By  C 5l  there  was  a  sanctuary  of  Apollo  Pythios, a  Pythion  (IG xii.5  1100,see  also  571  i);  he  may  well  have  been the  protective  deity.  Public  enactments  were  set  up  in  the sanctuary  (IG xii.5  1100.7\u00ad9  (C 5)).  A  dedication  of  C 5  is made  to  Apollo  without  epithet  (Dunant  and  Thomopoulos ( 1954)  346\u00ad48  no. 17  SEG 14.547).But  there  is  also  evidence of  a  temple  dedicated  to  Apollo  Smintheus  within  the  terri- tory  of  Poiessa  (IG xii.5  1101  with  Graindor  ( 1903)  290; Galani  et al.( 1982\u00ad84)  242).  An  individual  who  served  in  a public  office ( arxas)  made  a  dedication  (C 5?  C 4?)  to  Hermes Prytaneios  (Mendoni  ( 1989)  295\u00ad96  no.  III).  Strabo  men- tions  a  sanctuary  of  Athena  Nedousia  ( 10.5.6).  Communal cults  of  Apollo  Melanthios  (IG xii.5  1101  (undated))  and  an Apollo  without  epithet  (and  so  perhaps  Pythios?,  SEG 14.547 (C 5))  are  attested.  Poiessa  was  probably  among  the  Keian cities  permitted  to  restore  their  fortification walls in the period  354\u00ad338  (IG ii\u00b2  404  with  Maier  ( 1959\u00ad61)  no. 37  and Maier  ( 1958)).Remains  of  city  walls  have  been  dated  as  start- ing  in  C 6l  (Galani  et al.( 1982\u00ad84)  239).  If  correctly  restored by  M\u00fcller,  Ps.-Skylax  58  refers  to  Poiessa's  harbour.  The approximate  boundaries  of  its  territory  have  been  worked out  (see  Papageorgiadou-Banis  ( 1999)  161  fig. 1).The  territo- ry is  referred  to as  (IG xii.5  568.1,  1100.1). For  the  boundary,  see  Galani  et al.( 1982\u00ad84)  238).  No  coins are  known  (see  Papageorgiadou-Banis  ( 1997)  51\u00ad52  re  a  false attribution). 495.Keria  (Keraitas) Map  61.

The  city-ethnic  is  (I.Cret. iv  206K (C 3\u00adC2)).  The  Kerians  were  assessed  for  tribute  by  the Athenians  in  425/4  (supra),  apparently  13  dr.,  but  the  entry  is exceptional  in  being  the  only  one  in  which  the  sum  is recorded  to  the  right  of  the  toponym/ethnic.  In  the Hellenistic  period  a  Kerian  citizen  received  proxenia  from Gortyns  (no. 960)  on  Crete  (supra).  Despite  the  lack  of explicit  attestation,  it  seems  reasonable  to  infer  that  Keria was  possibly  a  polis  in  the  Classical  period. 496.

The  toponym  is ,  (Hdt. 3.58.1;Isoc.  19.7),  denoting  both  the  island (Theophr.  Lap. 42)  and  the  town  (Hdt. 3.57.4;  Ps.-Skylax 58). The  city-ethnic  is  (Hdt. 3.57.2;  IG iv  839.6  (C 4)). Siphnos  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Hdt. 3.58.1; Isoc. 19.19,  38\u00ad39)  and  in  the  political  sense  (Isoc. 19.10;  IG iv 839.5\u00ad6  (C 4)).  The  Siphnians  are  listed  as  one  of  the  poleis providing  ships  for  the  Greek  fleet at Salamis (Hdt. 8.42.1, 46.4,  48,  49.1).  The  territorial  sense  may  be  a  connotation  at Isoc. 19.20.  In  Siphnos  was  found  a  copy  of  the  Athenian Coinage  Decree  (IG xii.5480  IG i\u00b3  1453E),  to  be  set  up  in the  agora  of  all  the  poleis  of  the  Delian  League  (ll. 4\u00ad5). Siphnos  is  called  an  asty  at  Hdt. 3.58.4.  The  collective use  of the  city-ethnic  appears  internally  in  abbreviated  form  on coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  inscriptions  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.20; I.D\u00e9los 98A.12  ( 377/6);  Agora xvi  50.10  ( 365\u00ad355))  and  in  lit- erary  sources  (Hdt. 3.57.2,  8.46;Dem.  13.34).  For  the  individ- ual  and  external  use,  see  IG xii.5  611.2  CEG i410  (C 6l);  IG i\u00b3  1032.163  ( 405).  Patris  is  found  in  Isoc. 19.7  and 23. Strabo,  quoting  Artemidoros,  lists  Siphnos  among  the Kyklades  ( 10.5.3;  cf.  Steph.  Byz. 454.6).  The  Siphnian  coun- tryside  is  littered  with  towers  (N.  G.  Ashton  ( 1991));  the famous  mines,  which  began  to  be  exploited  in  C 6,have been well  studied  (Wagner  and  Weisgerber  ( 1985)).  The Siphnians  distributed  the  income  from  these  mines  each year  among  themselves  (Hdt. 3.57.2).  Late  sources  report settlements  called  (Steph.  Byz. 106.11)  and (Steph.  Byz. 454.6),both  undated  and  unlocated.  We do  not  know  the  name  of  the  large  settlement  at  Ag.  Andreas occupied  from  the  Geometric  through  the  Hellenistic  peri- od;  it  is  possible  that  this  settlement  rivalled  the  main  one  at modern  Kastro  for  a  while  before  Siphnos  was  consolidated as  a  single  polis  (Philippaki  ( 1973);  cf.  Reger  ( 1997)  459\u00ad60). Siphnos  was  allegedly  colonised  by  Ionians  from  Athens (Hdt. 8.48).  Herodotos  extols  Siphnian  wealth  in  C 6l, famous  enough  to  tempt  Samians  who  needed  money  in their  fight against P olykrates;  after  destroying  the  Siphnians' countryside,  defeating  them  in  battle,  and  besieging  the  asty, the  Samians  exacted  100  tal.  (Hdt. 3.57\u00ad58).  In  490  the Siphnians  refused  the  Persian  demand  to surrender  (Hdt. 8.46.4).Siphnos  fought  on  the  Greek  side  in  the  Persian  War, contributing  one  ship  (Hdt. 8.46.4,  48)  and  is  recorded  on the  Serpent  Column  in  Delphi  (ML  27.10). Siphnos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League  and  proba- bly  among  the  original  members  (ATL  iii. 198).  It belonged to  the  Island  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from 450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.20)  to  416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.26)  a  total  of 772 reger eleven  times,  four  times  completely  restored,  paying  a phoros  of 3  tal.  in  all  years  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.20).It  was  assessed  for tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.66)  for  9  tal.  Siphnos  joined  the Second  Athenian  Naval  League  in  the  370s  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.30), and  in  370/69  the  Siphnians  dedicated  a  crown  to  Athena  in Athens  (IG ii\u00b2  1425.125).  A  treaty  between  the  Siphnians  and the  Athenians  (no. 361)  regulated  capital  crimes,  among other  matters  (Agora xvi  50  (c. 360\u00ad350)).  To  the  same  peri- od  belongs  a  treaty  between  Siphnos  and  Kalaureia  (no. 360) (IG iv  839).  During  the  initial  phases  of  Alexander's  war against  the  Persian  Empire,  Datames  held  the  island,  which was  used  as  a  forward  naval  base  (Arr.  Anab. 2.2.4,  13.4). In C 5  the  Siphnian  constitution  was  democratic;  but  in, probably, 405/4  an  oligarchic  (Isoc. 19.13,  38)  government was  set  up  supported  by  a  Lakedaimonian(?)  garrison.  The oligarchs  were  in  turn  expelled  by  the  democratic  exiles, probably  in  394/3  (Isoc. 19.19\u00ad20).  Supported  by some  mer- cenaries,  the  oligarchic  exiles  ventured  an  attack  on  the island,  but  they  were  defeated  in  a  battle  fought  outside  the town (Isoc. 19.38\u00ad39),  and  the  constitution  was  still  demo- cratic  in  C 4m  (Agora xvi  50.9\u00ad10  SEG 17  19  ( 365\u00ad355)).For the  reconstruction  of  this  stasis,  see  Blass  ( 1892)  ii 23536; Gehrke,  Stasis 151). Our  only  source  for  Siphnian  political  institutions  in  the Classical  period  is  Isokrates'  Aiginetan  speech  in  which  we hear  of  Siphnian  nomoi  on  adoption  and  inheritance  ( 13,15), a  system  of  liturgies  incumbent  on  the  wealthy  ( 36),  and  the office of  basileus  ( 36).  An  embassy  to  Siphnos,  sent  by Samian  exiles  in  the  520s,  is  mentioned  at  Hdt. 3.58.1.The existence  of  a  prytaneion  (infra)  implies  prytaneis. Communal  cults  include  one  for  the  Nymphs  (IG xii.5 483),  who  had  a  cult  site.  The  Siphnians  consulted  the  oracle at  Delphi  c. 520  (Hdt. 3.57.3\u00ad58.1;  Paus. 10.11.2;  Suda 511; Fontenrose  ( 1978)  307  Q 115)  and  built  the  famous  Siphnian Treasury  with  a  tenth  of  the  income  from  their  mines  (Hdt. 3.57.2;  Daux  and  Hansen  ( 1987);  Jacquemin  ( 1999)  352  no. 441;  Neer  ( 2001). The  polis  site  was  on  the  east  coast  of  the  island  and  was presumably  walled  by c. 500  (Brock  and  Macworth  Young ( 1949)  2).  By  c. 525  the  Siphnians  had  a  prytaneion  built of  Parian  marble  (Hdt. 3.57.4)  and  an  agora  (Hdt. 3.57.4) where  probably  the  Athenian  Coinage  Decree  was  set  up (supra).

Size of  territory: 2  (c. 47  km \u00b2).Type:A.The  toponym  is  ', (CID ii  12.ii.30).The  city-ethnic  is  '(IGii\u00b243B24; as  in  IG ii\u00b2  1128.25  Ro 40)  or  (once)   (SEG 92.45,  but  the  ethnics  in  this  inscription  are  generally odd).  Ioulis  is  referred  to  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  the term at  Ps.-Skylax  58.  It  is  called  polis  in  the political  sense  in  IG ii\u00b2  111.6  Tod 142,  and  in  the  territorial sense  (city  plus  hinterland)  in  SEG 14.532.3  Migeotte ( 1992)  no .  56  (C 4l/C3e).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic is  attested  both  externally  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B24;  SEG 92.45)  and internally  (IG ii\u00b2  1128.25).The  individual  use  of  the  city-eth- nic  is  probably  attested  in  a  Delian  inscription  of 301  (IG xi.2 146.45).  For  a  later  unquestionable  attestation,  see  I.D\u00e9los 2634.17  (C 2),  with  SEG 45  1049  for  the  date. A  fragmentary  C 4m  list  of  citizens  (or  rather  citizens  fit for  military  service)  must  originally  have  recorded  about 480  names,  corresponding  to  a  citizenry  of  about  700  adult males  and  a  population  of  roughly  3,500  persons  (IG xii.5 748 reger 609;  see  Ruschenbusch  ( 1982);  Cherry,  Davis  and Mantzourani  ( 1991)  236\u00ad37;  Hansen  ( 1997)  28\u00ad29  with  n. 147;  Brun  ( 1989)  126\u00ad27  for  the  date).  The  citizens  were organised  into  seven  phylai,  of  which  the  names  of  four  are preserved:  Leodai,  Hylichidai,  Thyssidai  and  Koresioi.  The presence  of  the  Koresioi  shows  that  in  this  period  Koresia had  already  been  turned  into  a  subdivision  of  Ioulis  (but  this absorption  did  not  last,  since  Koresia  appears  once  again  in the  Hellenistic  period  as  an  independent  polis  before  Ioulis finally absorbs it;  see  Reger  ( 1998)).  The  number  of  adult male  citizens  of  Ioulis  before  the  incorporation  of  Koresia comes  to  c. 550  and  the  population  to  c. 2,500  persons. `  is  attested  as  a  sub-ethnic  in  an  undated  sepul- chral  inscription:  IG xii.5637  (Jones,  POAG 204\u00ad6).  In C 4l/C3e  the  citizens  were  further  subdivided  in  units  called (SEG 14  532.16\u00ad17). Ioulis  occupied  the  north-eastern  quadrant  of  the  island and  bordered  on  the  territories  of  Koresia  and  Karthaia (infra).  Its  harbour  (limen)  (IG ii\u00b2  1128.38)  lay  at  Otzias, where  recent  work  has  revealed  the  traces  of  docks  and  other facilities  (Spondyles  ( 1998)).  The  river  Elixos  (Strabo  10.5.6) rose  near  Ioulis  and  flowed down into the sea b y  Koresia. The  approximate  boundaries  of  Ioulis  can  be  worked  out  on the  basis  of  topography  and  some  of  the  sites  that  recent intensive  fieldwork b y  several  teams  have  discovered  (see generally  Reger  ( 1998)  and  the  map  at  Cherry,  Davis  and Mantzourani  ( 1991)  6). The  eponymous  official was an archon,  known  first from Hellenistic  texts  (IG xii.5  610.1  (C 3l),  597  with  Mendoni ( 1989)  292\u00ad95  no. ii  (C 3),595  (C 3\u00adC2)).As  early  as  C 5s,how- ever,  we  hear  of  a  boule  and  a  demos  meeting  in  an  ekklesia (IG xii.5593.B.1\u00ad3,C.1).  Other  C 4  officials include a board of,  probably,  five strategoi  (IG ii\u00b2  111.15\u00ad17),  a  board  of  judi- cial  officials called prostatai  (IG ii\u00b2  1128.36)  and  a  gramma- teus  (SEG 14  532.18).  The  references  to Thesmophylakes  and  a grammateus  may  be  C 4  or  C 3e  (IG xii.5  595B;  SEG 14  532). Laws  (nomoi)  and  decrees  were  passed  by  the  boule  and  the ekklesia  (IG xii.5593  (C 5);  IG ii\u00b2  1128  (C 4m)).  Of  public enactments  preserved  in  inscriptions  the  most  notable  is  the C 5s  law  on  burial  rites  and  customs  (IG xii.5.593;  cf.  SEG 45 2263).  In  connection  with  the  abortive  revolt  against  Athens in  the  360s,  the  death  penalty  and  confiscation of  property were  imposed  on  pro-Athenian  citizens,  and  the  Ioulitai murdered  the  citizen  who  served  as  Athenian  proxenos  (IG ii\u00b2  111).The  protective  deity  was  certainly  Apollo  Pythios  (cf. IG ii\u00b2  111.22).  Other  communal  cults  include  Athena  (IG xii.5  611  (C 6\u00adC5)).  The  month  of  Hermaion  is  attested  (IG ii\u00b2  1128;  Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 55). The  urban  centre  lay  inland  at  modern  Chora,  about  3  km from  the  coast.  Part of  the  C 5  acropolis  fortification wall still exists  (Welter  ( 1954)  71\u00ad74).  The  walls  were  repaired  in C 4l/C3e  (SEG 14  532  Migeotte  ( 1992)no.56).In  C 4  inscrip- tions  are  mentioned  a  prytaneion  (IG ii\u00b2  1128.34\u00ad35),  a  sanc- tuary  of  Apollo  Pythios  where  many  public  documents  were inscribed  (IG ii\u00b2  111.22;  IG xii.5  1102  Migeotte  ( 1984)  no. 63 (C 4\u00adC3);  cf.  Welter  ( 1954)  74\u00ad78),  and  a  Lykeion  (SEG 14 532.19).A  theatre  is  attested  for  C 3  (IG xii.5597.8).A  sanctu- ary  of  Zeus  Ikmaios  may  have  stood  on  the  border  between Ioulis  and  Karthaia  (IG xii.5  543;  K.  Manthos  ( 1991)  62\u00ad63 with 135  n. 328;B\u00fcrchner  ( 1921)  186;for  sacrifices b y  Aristaios to  Zeus  on  Keos,  see  Theophr.  De  vent. 14).  Within  the  terri- tory  of  Ioulis  K.  Manthos  believed  he  had  identified a sanc- tuary  of  Aphrodite,  but  this  has  been  doubted  (Manthos ( 1991)  46  with  Mendoni's  comments  at  119  n. 179);  two  other sanctuaries  have  been  identified archaeologically but not assigned  to  deities  (Georgiou  and  Faraklas  ( 1985)  nos. 18.08, 13.06).Miltos,which  figured so importantly in r elations  with Athens  in  C 4  (and  undoubtedly  earlier  as  well),  was  mined at  two  or  more  sites  in  the  territory  of  Ioulis  (Georgiou  and Faraklas  ( 1985)  no. 17.04;  Mendoni  ( 198586)  181\u00ad82),  and the  Ioulietan  decree  on  the  export  of  miltos  refers  to the  harbour  (limen)  of  the  city  (IG ii\u00b2  1128.38). Ioulis  struck  coins  of  silver  and  bronze  from  C 6m onward.  The  most  recent  study  of  Keian  coins  assigns  four series  of  silver  coins  to  Ioulis  in  C 6\u00adC4.(1)  Silver  on  the Aiginetan  standard.

The  toponym  is `,  (Hyp. 2.18;fr.7,Sauppe;  IG ii\u00b2  1672.277  ( 329/8; IG xii.8  5.5)).  The  city-ethnic  is  `  (Hdt. 6.140.2) or  (late)  `  (IG xii.828.13\u00ad14  (third  century ad)).  Hephaistia  is  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  by Hypereides  at  2.18,  and  in  the  urban  and  political  senses combined  by Dionysios  of  Chalkis  (FGH iv  393  fr. 2  (C 4?)). The  collective  use  of  the  ethnic  is  attested  internally  on  coins (infra)  and  externally  in  the  ATL  (IG i\u00b3  267.iv.31). Individuals  are  described  as   `  (IG ii\u00b2  8826 (C 4f)). As  an  Athenian  dependency  Hephaistia  is  called   [ \u00b5         `] (IG  xii.8 15.3\u00ad4  (C 4s);cf.26b),or  just  \u00b5   `(Hyp. 2.18).  In  the  ATL  Hephaistia  is  listed  as  `~  (IG i\u00b3 267.iv.31,  etc.).  All  attestations  of  civic  subdivisions  copy Athens:  citizens  were  organised  into  the  Kleisthenic  phylai and  demoi  (IG i\u00b3  1477  (C 5e);  SEG 45  1181  (C 4l/C3e);  SEG 45 1189  (C 4)).  A  number  of  decrees  concerning  the  Kabeireion were  passed  by  the  demos  of  the  initiated  ( \u00b5  \u00b5).  The  organisation  of  the  ekklesia  is  an  exact copy  of  the  Athenian  ekklesia  (SEG 45  1181,  1187,  1189;  cf. Cargill  ( 1995)  181\u00ad82).  The  eponymous  official was an archon  (SEG 45  1181  (c. 300)). The  name  of  the  polis  derives  from  Hephaistos,  who  is said  to  have  landed  on  Lemnos  after  Zeus  threw  him  out  of Olympos  (Hom.  Il. 1.593);  in  a  late  inscription  Hephaistia  is the  aegean  757 called  \"the  polis  of  Hephaistos\"  (IG xii.827.1\u00ad2).  The Kabeireion,  the  sanctuary  of  the  Dioskouroi,  started  in  C 8 and  was  in  continuous  use  thereafter  (Akousilaos  (FGrHist 2)  fr. 20;  Pherekydes  (FGrHist 3)  fr. 48,  etc.;  see  Accame ( 1941\u00ad43)  for  the  inscriptions;  Hemberg  ( 1950)  160\u00ad70; Beschi  ( 1994),non  vidi;  cf.  SEG 45  1194).Temples  of  Herakles and  of  course  of  Hephaistos  are  known (Fredrich  ( 1906a) 251,  255;  Sealey  ( 1918\u00ad19)  168\u00ad69);  the  theatre  is  early Hellenistic  (TGR  ii. 244).A  possible  fort  or  settlement  with- in  the  territory  of  the  polis  has  been  reported  at  Kaminia (Fredrich  ( 1906a)  252\u00ad53).  The  famous  Lemnian  earth  was mined  here,  though  our  earliest  sources  are  late  (Hasluck ( 1909\u00ad10)).  In  the  territory  of  Hephaistia  a  number  of  horos inscriptions  have  been  found,  all  modelled  on  the  Athenian horoi  (Finley  ( 1985)  nos. 103\u00ad10;  SEG 45  1185\u00ad91).  Recent Italian  excavations  have  revealed  town  walls  probably  of  C 4 or  later  (see  E.  Carando,  ASAtene  forthcoming;  AR ( 2000\u00ad2001)  111;  A.  Di  Vita,  ASAtene  ( 1998/2000)  386,  for  the opinion  that  the  walls  are  Archaic,  perhaps  as  old  as  C 7). They  enclosed  an  area  of 31.6  ha  (Lang  ( 1996)  56). Hephaistia  struck  bronze  coins  from  C 4f  onwards.

Lat. 37.05,long.  26.50.  Size  of territory: 2  ( 53  km \u00b2).  Type:  C.  The  toponym  is  , (Thuc. 8.26.1;  Hdt. 5.125).  The  city-ethnic  is   (Demodokos  fr. 2.1\u00ad2,  West;  in  Strabo  10.5.12  erroneously ascribed  to  Phokylides).  The  fragment  runs: \u00b5.   . \u00b5,   '   ./ ,  --    (Anth.  Pal. 11.235).  If  Prokles  was  the  tyrant  of  Leros,  as  suggested  by Manganaro  ( 1963\u00ad64)  297,  Leros  was  probably  a  tyrannical- ly  governed  polis  in  C 6,  and is  a  city-ethnic  attested externally  both  collectively  and  individually.  But,  even  so,  it is  far  from  clear  whether  Prokles  was  a  creature  of  the Milesians  (no. 854)  or  was  overthrown  by  them,  as  has  been suggested  on  the  basis  of  Demodokos'  verses  (see Manganaro  ( 1963\u00ad64)  297).  A  Milesian  settlement  on  Leros, mentioned  by  Anaximenes  in  a  list  of  Milesian  colonies, cannot  be  closely  dated  and  need  not  mean,  as  some  have suggested,  a  Milesian  klerouchia  on  Leros  (FGrHist 72  fr. 26, from  Strabo  14.1.6;  Manganaro  ( 1963\u00ad64)  297;  N.  Ehrhardt ( 1983)  16).  Hekataios  urged  Aristagoras  during  the  Ionian Revolt  to  fortify  Leros  as  a  refuge,  lest  he  be  expelled  from Miletos  (Hdt. 5.125);  Leros  may  therefore  have  been  a Milesian  possession  by  c. 495,  or  the  circumstances  of  the Revolt  may  have  impelled  the  Milesians  to  take  full  control of  the  island.  In  any  case  the  island  was  clearly  Milesian  by 454/3,  when  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  record payment  by [  ]    (IG i\u00b3  259.vi.19\u00ad20;see infra 1085), who  are  probably  to  be  regarded  as  citizens  who  stayed  loyal to  Athens  after  the  Milesians  revolted  (Meiggs  ( 1972)  112). The  main  settlement  shows  occupation  from  C 6.  There  is, however,  some  dispute  about  its  location  (Bean  and  Cook ( 1957)  135;  Benson  ( 1963)  2\u00ad12,(1976)  501;  B\u00fcrchner  ( 1925) 2095\u00ad96).  At  the  north  end  of  the  island  stood  an  extra- mural  sanctuary  dedicated  to  Parthenos  and  attested  by  C 4l (Klytos  of  Miletos  (FGrHist 490)  fr. 1;  Manganaro  ( 1963\u00ad64) 306\u00ad8  no. 3.22\u00ad23:[     ]        [ ] (C3\u00adC2);  see  308\u00ad9  no. 4.9,  where  the  expression appears  in  full;  Benson  ( 1963)  16\u00ad19);  she  was  probably  the protective  deity.  She  is  also  mentioned  as  in  a  dedication  found  on  Thera  (IG xii.3440).  She  has  been identified as a t ype  of  Artemis  (Manganaro  ( 1963\u00ad64)  301;  cf. Nikandros  in  Anth.  lib. 2,  non  vidi),  but  others  see  her  as  an  indigenous  goddess  (Laumonier  ( 1958)  550;  see  also  N.  Ehrhardt  ( 1983)  149).Benson  ( 1963)  12\u00ad13  believed  he  had identified r emains  of  an  Asklepieion.  The  fort  or  fortified settlement  at  Xerokambos  starts  only  in  C 4  (Hope  Simpson and  Lazenby  ( 1970)  54).  See  Gorman  ( 2001)  49\u00ad51  for  an overview.

Cal. x.1  (C 4\u00adC3);  1B.16  (C 4);  Strabo 10.5.19;  Steph.  Byz. 350.12).  In Homer  (Il. 2.677: ),  and  in  a  number  of  late  interpretations  of  this line  (Strabo  10.5.14,  19;  Eust.  Il. 1.495.4ff,  49612ff;  Hsch. 527) the toponym occurs in the plural,  and  it  seems  rea- sonable  to  suppose  that  the  islands  in  the  vicinity  of Kalymna  were subsumed  under  the  plural  toponym Kalydnai,  even  if  we  cannot  say  for  sure  which  islands  were included.  The  contrast  ATL  finds in a K alymnian  inscription between  the  Kalydnian  islands  and  the  demos  of  the Kalymnians  (Tit.  Cal. 64  (C 3l)  Syll. 3567;  ATL  cites  SGDI iii  3586)  rests  on  a  false  restoration;  lines  9\u00ad10  are  better restored  as           the  aegean  743  [\u00b5] as  proposed  by  Herzog  ( 1902)  319,who saw  in  the  islands  Pserimos,  Telendos  and  other  small islands  near  Kalymna. The  city-ethnic  was  originally  (IG i\u00b3  261.i.10; Hdt. 7.99.2;  Androtion  (FGrHist 324)  fr. 27),  from  C 4 \u00b5  (Tit.  Cal. 1  (C 4);  Men.  fr. 348).  Kalymna  is  called a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Tit.  Cal. 11.9  (C 4\u00adC3))  and  in the  political  sense  (Tit.  Cal. 7.15\u00ad16  (C 4l/C3e);  I.Knidos 221A.6\u00ad7,  15,  35\u00ad36,B36  (c. 300)).  The  collective use  of  the city-ethnic  appears  internally  in  Kalymnian  decrees  of  C 4 (Tit.  Cal. 1A\u00adC)  and  externally  in  the  Knidian  arbitration between  Kos  (no. 497)  and  Kalymna  (I.Knidos 221A.15 (c. 300))  and  in  literary  sources  (Hdt. 7.99.2).  The  external and  individual  use  of  the  ethnic  is  attested  in  the  arbitration decree  (I.Knidos 221B.36\u00ad37)  and  in  a  fragment  of  Menander (fr. 348).  It is  called  patris  in  Tit.  Cal. 235  (C 5)  and  Tit.  Cal  no.  x  CEG ii  716  (C 4l/C3e). According  to  Hdt. 7.99.2\u00ad3,  Kalymna  was  colonised  by Epidauros  (no. 348).  Diodorus'  version  ( 5.54.3),  which replaces  Epidauros  with  Kos  (no. 497),  should  almost  cer- tainly  be  seen  as  an  invention  related  to  the  absorption  of Kalymna  by Kos  in  C 3l  (Tit.  Cal. xii).  Diodorus  gives Thettalos,  son  of  Herakles,  as  the  oecist  ( 5.54.1). Herodotos  noted  one  or  two  warships  of  the  Kalydnians under  the  command  of  Artemisia  at  Salamis  ( 7.99.2).  The Kalydnians  were  members  of  the  Delian  League.  They belonged  to  the  Karian  district  (IG i\u00b3  269.v.7)  and  are recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  452/1  (IG i\u00b3  261.i.10)  to 415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.i.19)  a  total  of  fourteen  times,  twice  com- pletely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1  tal. 3,000  dr.  down  to 433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.i.55)  and  thereafter  an  unknown  amount (IG i\u00b3  280.i.50).  The  Kalydnians  were  assessed  for  tribute  in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.148).  It  seems  clear  that  here  we  have  some kind  of  grouping  around  Kalymna  to pay  tribute,  since  there seems  to  be  no  evidence  that  the  Kalydnai  islands  were  a polis. On  the  other  hand,  some  scholars  have  proposed  that Kalymna  hosted  three  poleis,  none  of  which  was  called Kalymna.  Bean  and  Cook  (( 1957)  131\u00ad33),  following  and  sys- tematising  earlier  suggestions,  argue  that  Kalymna  had three  poleis,  called  Pothaia,  located  by  modern  Damos  and encompassing  the  whole  valley  there,  Orkatos,  which  would have  occupied  the  region  of  modern  Rina  (Vathy)  and  its valley  (cf.  Newton  ( 1865)  i. 319\u00ad20),  and  Panormos,  located on  the  nearby island  of  Telendos,  or  possibly  at  Sykia.  Our evidence  for  the  organisation  of  these  entities  is  Hellenistic, but  it  seems  clear  that  by  some  point  in  C 4  there  was  a Kalymnian  polis,  well  attested  epigraphically  (see  infra;but see  also  Bean  and  Cook  ( 1957)  131\u00ad33,  who  argue  that  there never  was  a  single  state  called  Kalymna  on  Kalymna).  If there  were  in  fact  three  poleis  on  Kalymna  before  c.C 4m, which  had  formed  some  kind  of  synteleia  with  several  of  the smaller  nearby  islands  to  pay  Athenian  tribute  in  C 5,per- haps  they,  like  Kos,  may  have  undergone  a  synoecism  at roughly  the  same  time. In C 4  the  Kalymnians  had  a  council  (boule)  (Tit.  Cal. 3.1, 8.1)  and  an  assembly,  called  ekklesia  (Tit.  Cal. 1A\u00adB,  2.1\u00ad2, 3.2)  or  damos  (Tit.  Cal. 7.3,  8.1).  Decrees  (psephismata)  were passed  by  the  ekklesia  (Tit.  Cal. 1A\u00adB,  2.1\u00ad2)  or  by  the  boule and  the  damos  (Tit.  Cal. 8.1,  9.1)  or  by  the  damos  alone  (Tit. Cal. 7.19);  sometimes  proposals  were  put  forward  by  a  board of  prostatai  (Tit.  Cal. 7.1,  8.2),  and  sometimes  they  were brought  forward  on  the  motion  of  an  individual  (Tit.  Cal. 2.3\u00ad4,3.3).Kalymna  bestowed  proxenia  on  citizens  of  Delphi (no. 177)  (Tit.  Cal. 1B),Sikyon  (no. 228)  (Tit.  Cal. 1C),Athens (no. 361)  and  (the  region  of)  Oita  (Tit.  Cal. 3),  and  citizen- ship  on  citizens  of  Thera  (no. 527)  (Tit.  Cal. 8)  and  Miletos (no. 854)(Tit.  Cal. 7.23). The  citizens  were  organised  into  tribes  ( )  and demes  ( \u00b5).  In  the  Hellenistic  period  there  were  a  mini- mum  of  five phylai  and  seven  damoi  (Jones,  POAG 231\u00ad36). The  three  ancient  Doric  phylai  are  attested  in  C 2  (Tit.  Cal. 88),  probably  as  a  survival  of  a  much  earlier  period.  A  citi- zenship  decree  of  C 4l/C3e  stipulates  that  the  new  citizen  be inscribed  in  the  phyle  called and  in  the  damos called (Tit.Cal.8.20\u00ad23;cf.9.7).The names of  two months  are  attested  in  C 4  inscriptions  (Tit.  Cal. 1A\u00adB);  they show  that  the  Kalymnian  calendar  was  identical  with  that  of Kos  already  in  the  Classical  period  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 179\u00ad81). A  late  inscription  attests  directly  to  Apollo  Delios  as  the  chief deity  (Iscr.  Cos  EV 232  (first/second c entury  ad),  but  there  is no  doubt  that  he  had  served  in  this  role  earlier  as  well  (see infra). The  site  of  the  polis  centre  of  Kalymna  has  not  been identified  with  certainty,  though  it  may  well  have  occupied the  site  of  the  modern  town  of  Embolos,  which  has  pro- duced  remains  of  Classical  and  Hellenistic  date  as  well  as Roman  period  sigillata  (Bean  and  Cook  ( 1957)  128\u00ad29). Others  have  suggested  a  site  at  Sykia  (Maiuri  ( 1925\u00ad26b) 323  n. 1,  \"Periboli\").  The  main  Kalymnian  sanctuary  was dedicated  to  Apollo  (Tit.  Cal. 8.25\u00ad26)  and  lay  outside  the putative  polis  centre.  It  was  in  use  throughout  the  Archaic and  Classical  periods  (Newton  ( 1865)i.  304\u00ad12).  Near  it  was a  theatre  possibly  antedating  C 3  (TGR  ii. 144). The  territory of  Kalymna  included  not  only  the  island  of  the  same  name,  but  several  neighbouring  islands.  Of 744 reger these  perhaps  only  Telendos,  Kalinos  and  Pserimos  were large  enough  to  have  been  occupied  permanently.  On Telendos  have  been  reported  ruins  of  a  theatre  and  other evidence  of  habitation  (Segre  ( 1944\u00ad45)  219);  Pserimos  has  yielded  an  inscription  of  (probably)  third  century  ad,  which  confirms the island's t oponym  as  \u00b5  (Tit. Cal. 250.1). The  C 6  coins  long  attributed  to  Kalymna  (Head,  HN \u00b2631; Segre  ( 1944\u00ad45)  5)  have  now  been  dissociated  from  the island  (Wartenberg  ( 1998),  unknown  to  Figueira  ( 1998) 578),  which  leaves  Kalymna  to  the  best  of  my  knowledge without  coinage  before  the  Hellenistic  period. K arpathos  (K arpathios)Map  60  (inset). Lat. 35.25\u00ad55,long.  27.5\u00ad15.  Size  of  territory: 4  ( 301  km \u00b2,or,if Saros  is  included, 324  km \u00b2).  The  toponym  is  , (Hdt. 3.45.1;Diod.  20.93.2);  the  form  occurs  in the  Homeric  Catalogue  of  Ships  (Il. 2.676).  The  toponym denotes  both  the  island  (Hymn.  Hom.  Ap. 43;Diod.  5.54.4; Strabo  10.5.17;  Steph.  Byz. 361.8)  and  one  of  the  towns  on  the  island  (IG i\u00b3  1454.35\u00ad37  (C 5s),  see  infra).  The  regional ethnic  is  (Archil.  fr. 248;  Arist.  Rhet. 1413a19; IG i\u00b3  271.i.66);  for  as  a  city-ethnic,  see  infra. Ps.-Skylax 99  calls  Karpathos  tripolis,  and  the  names  of three  poleis  are  attested  independently,  viz.  Arkes(s)ia, Brykous  and  Karpathos  (infra);  but  in  C 5  the  island  was  also home  to the  semi-independent  koinon  of  the  Eteoka- rpathians  (infra).  Strabo  ( 10.5.17),  however,  calls  the  island  tetrapolis.  This  must  reflect Strabo's c onfusion  (Reger ( 1997)  453)  and  not  the  absorption  of  Saros  as  suggested  by  Susini  ( 1963\u00ad64)  245  (see  under  Saros  for  further  discussion). Hsch. 3967  speaks  of  Karpathos  as   `.The island  was  indeed  incorporated  by  the  Rhodians  (no. 1000), but  the  date  is  not  certain  (Papachristodoulou  ( 1989) 45\u00ad46);  some  scholars  see  the  incorporation  as  a  process  that occurred  across  C 4  (Susini  ( 1963\u00ad64)  231).  Karpathos  had  a sanctuary  of  Poseidon  Porthmios,  who  was  perhaps  the guardian  deity.  Epigraphic  evidence  in  the  form  of  decrees published  at  the  sanctuary  belongs  in  the  Hellenistic  period (IG xii.11031\u00ad37),  but  the  archaeological  record  reaches back  into  the  Archaic  period  (Hope  Simpson  and  Lazenby ( 1962)  167),when  the  sanctuary  must  have  been  in  the  territ- ory  of  Brykous. On  Karpathos  have  been  found  remains  of  three  settle- ments  of  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods,  one  at  modern Ag.  Ioannis,  identified w ith  ancient  Brykous,  one  at  modern Arkassa,  identified w ith  ancient  Arkessia,  and  one  at  modern  Pegadi,  identified w ith  ancient  Potidaion  (Hope Simpson  and  Lazenby  ( 1962)  158). The  Athenian  tribute  lists  record  four  communities  on Karpathos  as  members  of  the  Delian  League:  Arkesia,  the Brykontioi,  the  Karpathioi  and  the  Eteokarpathioi.  A  com- bination  of  the  tribute  lists  with  the  other  sources  and  the archaeological  evidence  results  in  the  following  reconstruc- tion. 486.  Arke(s)seia  (Arkesieus) Map  60  (inset).  Lat. 35.30, long. 27.05.  Size  of  territory:  presumably  1  or 2.  Type:  A.  The toponym is ,  (IG i\u00b3  271.i.66\u00ad67)  or   (IG i\u00b3  272.i.77).  The  city-ethnic  is  (),attest ed  in late  sources  only  (IG xii.1218  (Hell.), 990  (Roman)). Arkeseia  is  convincingly  identified w ith  modern  Arkassa, where  an  abundance  of  sherds  from  the  Geometric  through the  Hellenistic  periods  were  found  in  and  around  an  acrop- olis  with  walls  of  the  late  Classical  or  Hellenistic  period enclosing  an  area  of  c. 1.5  ha  (Della  Seta  ( 1924\u00ad25)  91\u00ad92; Hope  Simpson  and  Lazenby  ( 1962)  162\u00ad63).  It  follows  that Arkeseia  is  one  of  the  three  poleis  referred to by tripolis  at  Ps.- Skylax 99  and  thus  attested  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  of  the term. Arkeseia  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Karian  district  (IG i\u00b3  269.iv.22)  and  is  recorded  in  the tribute  lists  from  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.ii.26\u00ad27)  to  428/7  (IG i\u00b3 283.iii.3)  a  total  of  nine  times,  twice  completely  restored, paying  a  phoros  of 1,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  263.ii.26\u00ad27).  It  is  listed  by toponym (IG i\u00b3  265.ii.49: []),  usually  specified as    ,that is,\"Arkes(s)eia of  Karpathos\" (IG i\u00b3  272.i.77),  or  as  []  ,\"Arkeseia of the  Karpathians\"  (IG i\u00b3  271.i.66\u00ad67).  Since  there  seems  to  be no  pattern  to  the  use,  no  change  in  status  should  be  inferred. 487. ", "Samothrake": "Identifier: 517. , (Samothrax) Map  57.  Lat. 40.30,long. 25.35.  Size  of  territory: 3  ( 178  km \u00b2).  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is \u00b5,  (Ar.  Pax 277;Xen.  Hell. 5.1.7),  in  the  Ionian the  aegean  769 dialect  \u00b5  (Hdt. 2.51.3),  denoting  both  the  island (Hdt. 2.51.3)  and  the  town  (Ps.-Skylax  67,Klausen).An  alter- native,  allegedly  earlier  toponym  is  ,  (Arist.  frr. 596\u00ad97).  The  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.13; Herzog  ( 1899)  17\u00ad21  no. 6.1  (C 3);  I.Lindos ii  93b.5  (C 3s)). Samothrake  is  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  an inscription  of  C 4m  or  350\u00ad325  (Fraser  ( 1960)  21  no. 1.3\u00ad4), and  is  implicitly  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ps.- Skylax 67.  The  MS  has  \u00b5   \u00b5. Klausen  restores  \u00b5    \u00b5, which  seems  to  be  a  much  more  convincing  restoration  than   \u00b5   \u00b5  preferred  in GGM  by  M\u00fcller  following  Voss  (for   \u00b5,see Flensted- Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  142).  The  collective use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  the  C 4  proxeny  decree (Fraser  ( 1960)  21  no. 1.3\u00ad4,  convincingly  restored)  and  on coins  of  C 5f(infra),  and  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute lists  (IG i\u00b3  263.iii.25)  and  in  literature  (Hdt. 2.51.2\u00ad3;  PCG, Adespota  fr. 1063.15).  For  the  individual  and  external  use,  see the  Athenian  naval  list  of  C 5l  (IG i\u00b3  1032.vi.84,  as  restored  in IG ii\u00b2  1951). Ps.-Skylax 67  places  Samothrake  in  Thrace,  and  Strabo classes  Samothrake  with  the  islands  lying  off  Greece  as  far  as Makedonia  and  Thrace  ( 2.5.21).  Accounts  of  the  colonisa- tion  of  the  island  found  in  Classical  sources  derive  from  a combination  of  the  toponyms  Samos  and  Thrake,  whether because  Samothrake  was  settled  by  exiles  from  Samos  (no. 864)  and  was  near  Thrace  (Ant.  fr. 1.1,  Gernet;  Paus. 7.4.3; Strabo  10.2.17  commenting  on  Hom.  Il. 13.13)  or  because  the island  was  settled  first b y  Thracians  and  then  by  Samians (Heracl.  Lemb. 49;  schol.  Hom.  Il. 24.78,  both  derived  from Aristotle;  Diod. 5.48.1);  these  Samians  are  said  to  have  been expelled  by  a  tyrant  (Heracl.  Lemb. 49,derived from Aristotle;  Suda 79  citing  Antiphon);  for  a  collection  of  all sources,  see  Graham  ( 2002)  232\u00ad39.  Herodotos  reports  that the  Pelasgians  who  fled A thens  settled  there  ( 2.51).  A  recent review  of  all  the  evidence  places  the  arrival  of  Greeks  from Samos  in  C 6f  (Graham  ( 2002);  for  a  date  of 700  from  the archaeological  record,  see  Lazarides  ( 1971)  18). The  Samothrakians  came  under  Persian  domination  in C 5e,  and  at  least  one  Samothrakian  ship  participated  in  the battle  of  Salamis  on  the  Persian  side  (Hdt. 8.90.2). Samothrake  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  (IG i\u00b3  272.ii.63)  and  is recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.13)  to 429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.31)  a  total  of  twenty-one  times,  three  times completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 6  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 259.iii.13),  reduced  to  2  tal.  in  430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.ii.16).  It  was presumably  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.158  ( 15 tal.),  completely  restored).  Antiphon  delivered  a  speech  On the  Tribute  of  the  Samothrakians  (fr. 1,Gernet),which  should be  associated  either  with  the  reduction  in  tribute  in  430/29 (see  Lazaridis  ( 1971)  20)  or  with  the  new  assessment  of 425/4 (Gernet's  preface  161).  In  404/3  the  island  fell  under  the  con- trol  of  the  Spartans  (anecdote  in  Plut.  Mor. 229D),  but  in 389/8  the  Athenians  recovered  the  island  (Xen.  Hell. 5.1.7), and  in  the  370s  the  Samothrakians  joined  the  Second Athenian  Naval  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.B.8).  By  C 5e  at  the  latest, Samothrake  controlled  a  peraia  on  the  Thracian  mainland opposite  (Hdt. 7.59.2,  108.2)  comprising  the  poleis  of  Drys (no. 644)  (Ps.-Skylax  67),  Masambrie  (no. 647)  (Hdt. 7.108.2),Sale  (no. 649)  (Hdt. 7.59.2)  and  Zone  (no. 651)  (Hdt. 7.59.2;  Ps.-Skylax 67)  and  a  fortification called Charakoma (Strabo  7  fr. 47,  infra 871).  They  lost  their  peraia  by 422/1;it was  recovered  after  the  end  of  the  Peloponnesian  War,  then lost  again  in  C 4m  (Gschnitzer  ( 1958)  32\u00ad34;  IG xii.8  p. 40). The  Aristotelian  collection  of  politeiai  included  a Constitution  of  the  Samothrakians  (frr. 596\u00ad97;Heracl. Lemb. 49).  But  almost  all  the  information  we  have  about political  institutions  is  Hellenistic  or  later.  The  only  pre- served  public  enactment  of  the  Classical  period  is  a  grant  of proxenia  to  a  citizen  of  an  unknown  polis  (Fraser  ( 1960)  21 no. 1.6  (c. 350\u00ad325)),  and  in  345/4  the  Samothrakians  offered a  series  of  crowns  to Athens  (no. 361)  (IG ii\u00b2  1443.ii.108\u00ad14). Diod. 5.48.1  reports  a  system  of  five phylai;  the  reference  is  to primordial  times,  but  the  myth  may  be  aetiological  (Jones, POAG 186). The  protective  deity  appears  to  have  been  Athena  (see Lehmann-Hartleben  ( 1939)  144),  whose  sanctuary  served  as the  civic  archive,  at  least  in  the  Hellenistic  period  (IG xii.8 153.10\u00ad11  (C 3)).  But  Samothrake  was  most  famous  for  its great  sanctuary  of  the  Kabeiroi;  earliest  cult  activity  at  the site  has  been  dated  to  C 7  or  earlier,  and  building  began  in C 6,  with  considerable  elaboration  in  C 4  (Hdt. 2.51.2\u00ad3;  cf. Strabo  10.3.19\u00ad21;  Hemberg  ( 1950)  49\u00ad131;  Lehmann  ( 1969) 2.51\u00ad70;  Lehmann  and  Spittle  ( 1982)  269;  Cole  ( 1984) 10\u00ad20;  for  a  collection  of  literary  sources,  see  N.  Lewis  ( 1958) 63\u00ad112;  for  a  synoptic  overview  of  what  we  know  of  the  cult, which  included  mysteries,  see  Burkert  ( 1993)).  The  round building  on  Samothrake  in  the  sanctuary,  dated  to  289\u00ad281 and  sometimes  regarded  as  a  bouleuterion,  is  actually  a  cult structure  (Gneisz  ( 1990)  350\u00ad51  no. 58).  Aphrodite  and Pothos  were  worshipped  within  the  sanctuary  of  the  Great Gods  (Lehmann  and  Spittle  ( 1982)  i. 277\u00ad89).A  sanctuary  to Artemis  is  reported  to  have  been  founded  before  the  arrival of  the  Greek  colonists  (BCH 118  ( 1994)  779). 770 reger The  urban  centre  was  walled  from  C 7\u00adC6  (Scranton ( 1941)  31\u00ad33,  154;  Lazaridis  ( 1971)  19).  The  preserved  walls  of, probably,  C 6,  with  later  repairs,  enclose  an  area  of  c. 20  ha (H.  Ehrhardt  ( 1985)  25\u00ad30).  Otherwise  very  little  seems  to have  been  published  about  the  urban  centre,  as  archaeolog- ical  work  has  concentrated  on  the  sanctuary.  A  harbour  is recorded  at  Ps.-Skylax  67. The  Samothrakians  struck  largely  anepigraphic  silver coins  c. 500\u00ad465  in  two  series.  Denominations:  staters,  tri- obols  and  smaller  fractions.  Types:  obv.  Sphinx,  or  Athena; rev.  incuse  square,  sometimes  with  lion's  head,  sometimes with  bearded  head  with  Corinthian  helmet.  A  few  examples bear  legends: or (Schwabacher  ( 1938),  ( 1952); IGCH  no. 696;  Erxleben  ( 1970)  117;  Sch\u00f6nert  Geiss  ( 1996) 271\u00ad72;  SNG  Cop.  Thrace 991).  No  coins  are  known  after c. 465;  the  next  series  begins  about  280  (Head,  HN \u00b2263). 516.  *Saros  (Sarios) Map  60  (inset).  Lat. 35.55,long.  27.15. Size of  territory: 1  ( 23  km \u00b2).  Type:  B.  No  toponym  is  attested (Susini  ( 1963\u00ad64)  245)  but  one  is  inferred  from  the  ethnic (IGi\u00b3283.iii.21,290.i.4).The Sarioi were members  of the  Delian  League  and  are  recorded  twice  in  the  tribute  lists, in 428/7  paying  a  phoros  of 300  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  283.iii.21)  and  in 415/14  paying  a  phoros  of 200  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  290.i.4).The  Sarioi  are absent  from  the  full  panel  of 441/0  (IG i\u00b3  271.i\u00adii.64\u00ad86). Mattingly  (( 1996)  77  n. 27)  has  suggested  that  Saros  may  have been  brought  under  Athenian  control  by  Lysikles  in  426. A  private  dedication  \"to  all  gods\",  is  known  from  C 4e  (IG xii.11040;  Susini  ( 1963\u00ad64)  246  for  date).  It  has  been  sug- gested  that  a  village  on  Saros  called     must have had a  Classical  origin  (Susini  ( 1963\u00ad64)  244;  cf.  Hiller  von Gaertringen  ( 1892)  309;  I.Lindos  p. 1013),  but  no  ancient remains  have  been  found  there  (Hope  Simpson  and Lazenby  ( 1962)  168). It  has  sometimes  been  argued  that  Saros  was  one  of  the entities  included  under  Karpathos  (Papachristodoulou ( 1989)  45),  but  this  seems  unlikely.  Karpathos  had  three poleis  according  to  Ps.-Skylax,  and  all  are  accounted  for  by written  and  archaeological  evidence  placing  them  on  the island.  Strabo  alone  ( 10.5.17)  attributes  four  poleis  to  the island  of  Karpathos,  but  to  accept  his  view  as  attesting  to Saros  as  a  fourth  polis  requires  identifying  his  Nisyros  as Saros  (so  Dawkins  ( 1902\u00ad3)  204,  followed  by  B\u00fcrchner ( 1919)  2003),  or  supposing  that  Saros  had  two  poleis  (as pointed  out  by  Susini  ( 1963\u00ad64)  245;see  also  Fraser  and  Bean ( 1954)  141\u00ad42).  This  is  convoluted,  and  it  is  easier  and  better simply  to  see  Strabo's  four  as  an  error  (Reger  ( 1997)  453  and supra 745).  It  is  just  possible  that  Saros  could  have  been  part of  Brykous  (no. 487),  for  the  two  are  never  listed  together  in ATL.  If  so,  they  will  have  been  separated  later,  when Karpathos  and  Saros  were  incorporated  into  the  Rhodian state,  for  both  andappear as demotics (IG xii.11010\u00ad1011,  220\u00ad23,  etc.).  However,  the  evidence  of the  tribute  lists  is  fragmentary  and  inconclusive.  While  certainty  in  this  matter  is  perhaps  impossible,  it  seems  simplest  to  suppose  that  Saros  was  in  fact  a  separate  entity  in C 5  and  C 4. 517.

The  only  piece  of  evidence  we  have  about  the  political institutions  is  a  casual  remark  in  Plato  that  one  may  advise the  Peparethians,  probably  in  their  assembly  (Alc. 116D). We  hear  of  two  communal  dedications  at  Delphi:  one  of booty  from  Salamis  in  480  (supra Jacquemin  ( 1999)  346 no. 387),  the  other  a  gold  crown  of  laurels  recorded  probably by Theopomp.  fr. 248  and  so  C 4  or  earlier. Hagnon  Peparethios  was  Olympic  victor  in  568 (Olympionikai 97). The  Peparethians  struck  mostly  anepigraphic  silver  coins on  the  Euboic  standard  c. 520\u00ad480.

Panormos  is  implicitly  referred  to as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense by  the  term  at  Ps.-Skylax  58.  It  is  the  second  polis  of the  island,  known  best  from  Diodorus'  narrative  of  a  siege  by Alexander  of  Pherai  in  361/0  (Diod. 15.95.1\u00ad2;Polyaen.  6.2.1). The  site  was  fortified in C 4m  (see  Diod. 15.95.2;  Fredrich ( 1906b)  117\u00ad21,  but  see  Scranton  ( 1941)  170).  Panormos  is  best regarded  as  a  dependent  polis  of  Peparethos. 511.  Peparethos Map 55.  Lat. 39.05,long.  23.45.  Size  of  ter- ritory: 2.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is  ,  (Dem. 18.70);  The  city-ethnic  is   (IG i\u00b3  270.iii.10).  The urban  centre  of  Peparethos  was  walled  by  426  and  had  a  prytaneion  (Thuc. 3.89.4;  S.  G.  Miller  ( 1978)  nos. 384\u00ad86). A  sanctuary  of  C 4l/C3e  dedicated  to  Asklepios  lay  about  1  km east  of  the  modern  town  (Liagkouras  ( 1962)).  Six  other  768 reger possible  sanctuary  sites  have  been  identified,  including two--above the main t own  and  at  Panaghia  Polemistria (Fredrich  ( 1906b)  115\u00ad16,  117)--that may have belonged t o Athena  Polias,  who  served  as  the  protective  deity  (Herbst ( 1937)  556).  Another  of  these  sites,  which  includes  a  terrace with  polygonal  blocks,  may  date  to  C 5  (Fredrich  ( 1906b)  127). 512. ", "Skiathos": "Identifier: 525. , (Skiathios) Map  55.  Lat. 39.10,long.  23.27. Size of  territory: 2  ( 50  km \u00b2).  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is ,  (Simonides  fr. 1;  Hdt. 7.179;  IG ii\u00b2  1623Aa35 ( 333/2)).  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  266.ii:5;  CID i 13.1  (C 4f);  Theopomp.  fr. 375).In  the  so-called  Charter  of  the Second  Athenian  Naval  League,  Skiathos  is  listed  under  the heading  polis  (IG ii\u00b2  43.A.78,  86).  For  polis  used  in  the  urban sense,  see  Ps.-Skylax  58,  where  Skiathos  is  described  as   \u00b5  (cf.  Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996) 156\u00ad57).  One  of  these  towns  was  the  Palaiskiathos  whose  cit- izen  was  honoured  by  the Athenians  in  408/7  (IG i\u00b3  109).That  the  territory  of  this  town and  the  island  were  coterminous  may  be  inferred  from  the language  of  the  Athenian  decree,  which  praises  him  for treating  well  Athenians  who  arrived  \"into  Skiathos\"  (IG i\u00b3 110.7\u00ad8,  10\u00ad12).  But  there  was  clearly  confusion  in  Athens between  Skiathians  and  Palaiskiathians,  because  the  decree includes  an  amendment  to  the  effect  that  Oiniades  be named instead  of (IG i\u00b3  110 26\u00ad31).  The  collective  use  of  the  ethnic  is  attested  internally on  coins  of  C 4s  (infra)  and  externally  in  the  Athenian  trib- ute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  266.ii  5).  For  the  individual  and  external  use, see  the  Athenian  C 5l  proxeny  decree  (IG i\u00b3  110.29). Skiathos  is  listed  among  the  Kyklades  by  Ps.-Skylax  58  and Diod. 15.30.5,  whereas  the  island  is  described  in  Strabo  9.5.16 as  one  of  the  islands  off  Magnesia.  According  to  Ps.- Skymnos  580  and 586,  Skiathos  was  colonised  by  the Chalkidians  from  Euboia. In 480  the  Greeks  stationed  three  ships  by  Skiathos  to watch  over  the  Persian  fleet;  signal  fires lit on the island communicated  information  back  to  the  Greeks  at Artemision  (Hdt. 7.179\u00ad83).  The  Skiathians  were  members of  the  Delian  League.  They  belonged  to  the  Thracian  district (IG i\u00b3  269.ii.30)  and  are  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from 450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.iii.40)  to  415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.iii.14)  a  total  of fourteen  times,  once  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  266.ii.5).  By  408/7  there  was  an  Athenian archon  on  Skiathos  charged  in  the  Athenian  decree  men- tioned  above  with  seeing  to  it  that  the  Palaiskiathians  not  be  mistreated  (IG i\u00b2  110.19\u00ad20).  Under  Spartan  hegemony from  the  end  of  the  Peloponnesian  War  until  Chabrias' the  aegean  773 expedition  in  the  Aegean  in  377/6  (Diod. 15.30.5),  the Skiathians  joined  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League  in  the 370s  (IG ii\u00b2  43.A.86).  In  351  Demosthenes  praised  Skiathos and  other  nearby  islands  for  the  logistical  support  they offered  the  Athenian  fleet ( 4.32);  in  345/4  an  Athenian  garri- son  stationed  on  Skiathos  offered  the  Athenian  demos  a crown  (IG ii\u00b2  1443.ii.106\u00ad8;  Dreher  ( 1995)  291  n. 55),  and ships  were  sent  to  Skiathos  commanded  by  a  strategos  (IG ii\u00b2 1623.35\u00ad49).  Inscriptions  from  Delphi  include  a  treaty between  the  Delphians  (no. 177)  and  Skiathians  about  con- sultation  of  the  oracle  (CID i13  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 295).  The treaty  opens  with  a  reference  to  the  Skiathian  demos  and colonists  (apoikoi). The  town  of  Skiathos  was  probably  located  at  modern Skiathos  town  (cf.  Fredrich  ( 1906b)  103;  see  also  Reger  ( 1997) 483  n. 25).  There  are  no  remains  of  any  other  settlement  on the  island.  A  Samian  funerary  inscription  of  C 5  has  been found  on  Skiathos  (Johnston  ( 1998)). The  Skiathians  seem  to  have  begun  to  strike  bronze  coins in  C 4m.

Lat. 38.55,long.  24.35.  Size of  territory 4  ( 223  km \u00b2).  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is  , (Soph.  Phil. 240;  IG xii.8  668.5  (C 4)),  denoting  both  the island  and  the  town  (Ps.-Skylax  58).  The  city-ethnic  is (Hdt. 7.183.3;  Stephanis  ( 1988)  no. 1797  (C 4)). Skyros  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Ps.- Skylax 58)  and  in  the  political  sense  (Xen.  Hell. 5.1.31). Two  lost  tragedies  both  entitled  testify  to  the  collective  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  (Soph.  frr. 507\u00ad10  and  Eur.  frr. 683\u00ad86,  Nauck),  which  is  also  known from  inscriptions  (IG i\u00b3  285.iv.107\u00ad10).  The  individual  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  Hdt. 7.183.3; the  internal  in  an  undated  sepulchral  inscription  (IG xii.8 676). Skyros  was  originally  inhabited  by  Pelasgians  (IG xii.8 p. 175).  The  island  was  seized  by  the  Athenians  under  Kimon (Diod. 11.60.2  ;Ephor.  fr. 191;Plut.  Cim. 8.3\u00ad7)  in,  probably, 476/5  (Plut.  Thes. 36.1).  The  inhabitants  were  subjected  to andrapodismos,  and  Skyros  was  resettled  with  Athenians (Thuc. 1.98.2),  apparently  described  as  klerouchs  by  Ephor. fr. 191  Diod. 11.60.2: ,  see  also  Graham ( 1983)  184\u00ad85;  Cargill  ( 1995)  6).  By  contrast  with  the Lemnians  and  Imbrians,  the  Skyrians  are  never  mentioned as  members  of  the  Delian  League,  and  so,  probably, remained  Athenian  citizens.  For  the  view  that  Skyros  may have  been  a  colony,  see  Figueira  ( 1991)  217,  221;  Salomon ( 1997)  68  takes  no  position  on  Skyros. Athens  had  to  surrender  Skyros  in  the  Peace  of 404 (Andoc. 3.12;Aeschin.2.76\u00ad77),but  by 392,after  a  short  peri- od  of  independence  (Andoc. 3.12,  14),  the  Athenians  had regained  control  of  the  island  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.15),  and Athenian  possession  was  confirmed b y  the  King's  Peace  of 386  (Xen.  Hell. 5.1.31).  The  grain  law  of 374/3  shows  that Skyros  was  still  an  Athenian  possession  (Hesperia  suppl. 29 5.6\u00ad8),  in  spite  of  the  decision  of 378/7  to  renounce  the  kler- ouchies  (Diod. 15.29.8).  Philip  II  must  have  recognised Skyros  as  an  Athenian  possession  in  338  (Paus. 1.25.3),  for Skyros  was  still  Athenian  in  the  320s  (Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 62.2), and  remained  Athenian  by  the  Peace  of 322  (Diod. 18.18.4; see  Cargill  ( 1995)  42\u00ad58). The  only  preserved  C 4  decree  passed  by  the  Skyrian  kler- ouchs  (IG xii.8  668)  indicates  that  the  C 4  population  of Skyros  was  divided  into  Athenians  and  inhabitants  (ll. 4\u00ad5:    [ \u00b5    ]        with  to  be  restored  in  l. 2),who  seem  to  have  had the  same  status  as  Athenian  metics  (Dem. 52.3,  9).  Such  civic subdivisions  as  are  attested  belong  to  the  Athenians  (IG xii.8 669;  Cargill  ( 1995)  389  no. 1124;  Jones,  POAG 188).  The  only important  river  was  called  the  Kephissos,  an  obvious  echo  of Attika  (Strabo  9.3.16).  Considerable  remains  of  the  main  city fortification walls are preserved;  they  have  been  dated,  exclu- sively  on  style,  to  C 4s;  the  walls  enclosed  an  area  of 4.5  ha, including  a  separately  fortified acropolis of 0.5  ha  (Fredrich ( 1906c)  262\u00ad71).  The  reference  at  Diod. 11.60.2  to  a  siege  of Skyros  indicates  that  the  city  was  fortified in C 5e.Remains  of a  small  temple  have  been  reported  (Fredrich  ( 1906c)  275\u00ad76). A  C 4  horos  inscription  has  been  found  (Finley  ( 1985)  no. 111:     ).  Plutarch  notes  a  settlement  named (Cim. 8.3),  which  has  been  identified w ith  exten- sive  ruins  on  the  south-west  coast  (Fredrich  ( 1906c)  274).  A scholiast  to  Diodorus  repeats  this  name  and  adds  another: Smyros:        (schol.  Diod. T 326).  Achilleion  has  been  taken  as  the  name  of  the  main anchorage  on  the  north-east  side  of  the  island,  south  of  the main  settlement,  and  not  as  a  settlement,  because  of  the absence  of  ancient  remains  there  (Fredrich  ( 1906c)  273\u00ad74). No  coins  appear  to  be  known  (Erxleben  ( 1970)  120). 522.Syme  (Symaios) Map  61.  Lat. 36.35,long.  27.50.  Size of  territory: 2  ( 58  km \u00b2).  Type:  [A].

The 774 reger city-ethnic  is  \u00b5(IG i\u00b3  282.ii.45).In  the  Athenian  trib- ute  lists  Syme  is  recorded  under  the  heading  h h  ~      (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.18\u00ad21,  28). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  in  the  tribute lists  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.45). According  to  Diodorus  ( 5.53.1\u00ad4),  Syme  was  settled  by Lakedaimonians  and  Argives,  later  joined  by  Knidians  and Rhodians.  Syme  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Karian  district  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.148)  and  is  record- ed  in  the  tribute  lists  either  by  toponym  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.28)  or by  city-ethnic  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.45)  from  434/3  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.28)  to 429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.45)  a  total  of  five times,  three  times  com- pletely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1,800  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.28). The  first four payments are r ecorded  among  those  by  poleis that  private  persons  had  inscribed  (IG i\u00b3  278.vi.18\u00ad21);  the fifth payment is assessed b y  the  boule  and  the  dikasterion  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.43\u00ad44).  Syme  was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3 71.ii.148)  for  3,000  dr.  Two fragments  of  the  Athenian Coinage  Decree  were  found  on  Syme  (IG i\u00b3  1453A,  D).  In 412/11  the  Peloponnesians  defeated  the  Athenians  in  a  naval battle  fought  off  Syme  (Thuc. 8.41\u00ad43). The  town  in  the  north-eastern  part  of  the  island  had  a walled  acropolis  with  a  sanctuary  of  Athena.  There  are  traces of  two  circuits  in  polygonal  masonry  with  interval  towers, probably  of  the  Hellenistic  period  (Zschietzschmann  ( 1931) 1098;  Hope  Simpson  and  Lazenby  ( 1962)  168\u00ad69,(1970) 63\u00ad64).  The  lower  wall  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 0.3  ha.  The  only inscription  antedating  the  Hellenistic  period  seems  to  be  a C 4  tombstone  set  over  a  soldier  killed  in  battle  (IG xii.3 9  CEG ii  694). Coins  sometimes  assigned  to  Syme  (see  Erxleben  ( 1970) 93)  can  now  be  assigned  rather  to  Syangela  (no. 931)  in  Karia on  the  basis  of  new  finds ( Yarkin  ( 1975),  ( 1977)). 523.Syros  (Syrios) Map  60  (inset).  Lat. 37.26,long.  24.56. Size of  territory: 3  ( 85  km \u00b2).Type:A.The  toponym  is  , (SEG 19  204A.3  (c. 375);  I.

Byz. 230.1),  denoting  both  the  island  (Strabo  10.5.3)  and  the town  (Ps.-Skylax  58).  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3 261.iv.31;  Arist.  Hist.  an. 557a3).  In Ps.-Skylax  58,  where polis is  used  in  the  urban  sense,  Syros  is  one  of  the  toponyms  list- ed  after  the  heading   ;  Syros  is  called  a  polis  in  the political  sense  at  Theopomp.  fr. 111  (rC 4f  according  to Jacoby's  commentary),  and  in  the  accounts  of  the  Delian amphiktyones,  where polis  is  used  in  the  political  sense,  the Syrians  are  recorded  under  the  heading     (I.D\u00e9los 97.13  (C 4f)).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic appears  internally  on  its  Hellenistic  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2492) and  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  261.iv.31) and  in  the  accounts  of  the  Delian  amphiktyones  (IG ii\u00b2 1635.1\u00ad2  ( 377\u00ad373)).  The  individual  and  external  use  of  the ethnic  appears  in  Aristotle  (Hist.  an. 557a3),  referring  to the C 6  poet  Pherekydes  of  Syros,  and  in  Theopomp.  fr. 111. Strabo,  citing  Artemidoros,  lists  Syros  among  the Kyklades  ( 10.5.3).  Homeric  Syrie  ( in  Od. 15.403)  is erroneously  identified w ith  Syros  by  both  Zschietzschmann ( 1932b)  1790  and  Meyer  ( 1975). Syros  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Island  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from 452/1  (IG i\u00b3  261.iv.31)  to  416/15  (IG i\u00b3  289.i.30)  a  total  of twelve  times,  four  times  completely  restored,  paying  a phoros  of 1,500  dr.  in  452/1,  reduced  to  1,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3 270.v.33)  in  or  before  448/7  (IG i\u00b3  264.ii.17),  but  raised  again to 1,500  dr.  in  or  before  433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.i.80).  It  was  assessed for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.80)  ( 1  tal.).  Syros  may  have joined  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League  in  the  370s (I.D\u00e9los 98A.11\u00ad12,B3=IG  ii\u00b2  1635A.11\u00ad12,  113  ( 377\u00ad375);  SEG 19  204  ( 375);  cf.  Dreher  ( 1995)  201  n .  22),  but  is  not  recorded among  the  members  listed  in  IG ii\u00b2  43.  In  the  thirteenth book  of  his  Philippika  Theopompos  reports  that  a  Syrian citizen,  Kallikon,  betrayed  Syros  to  the  Samians  (fr. 111). Jacoby ad  loc.  dates  the  incident  to  C 4f.The  C 4m  list  of  prox- enoi  of  Karthaia  (no. 492)  included  at  least  two  from  Syros (IG xii.5542.46). The  principal  civic  divisions  were  three  tribes  (IG xii.5 654  (undated),  with  Jones,  POAG 211),  the  names  of  two  of which  are  known:  the  Naxiatai  (IG xii.5652  (C 2),  with Gauthier  ( 1996)  35\u00ad43)  and  the  Galessioi  (I.D\u00e9los 98B.18 (C 4)).  Galessa,  which  must  have  been  the  centre  of  the  tribe of  the  same  name,  was  located  on  the  western  side  of  the island;  this  suggests  that  the  Syrian  tribes  were  territorially based.  Delian  Apollo  owned  some  property  on  the  island (I.D\u00e9los 104\u00ad11A21). The  chief  gods  were  very  likely  the  Kabeiroi,  although  the inscription  that  supposedly  attests  to  a  sanctuary  remains enigmatic  (IG xii.5673  with  commentary  there  by  Hiller  von Gaertringen  (undated);  see  also  Nicolet-Pierre  and  Amandry ( 1992)  305\u00ad6  n. 32,  for  a  late  coin  referring  to  this  cult;  Head, HN \u00b2492;  Hemberg  ( 1950)  182\u00ad84).  Archaeological  material from  the  Geometric  to  Roman  periods  that  might  be  associat- ed  with  such  a  sanctuary  has  been  reported  (Manthos  ( 1979)). The  ancient  polis  lies  beneath  the  modern  city  of  Ermoupolis and  is  therefore  unexplored  (Leekley  and  Noyes  ( 1975)  51). Syrian  drachmas  (  \u00b5  )  are  recorded  in  Delian accounts  of  C 4m  (I.D\u00e9los 104.105  ( 364/3));  in  consequence, the  aegean  775 Head's  date  of  c. 300  for  the  start  of  Syrian  coinage  is  too  late  by at  least  65  years  (Head,  HN \u00b2492).  But  the  known  coins  attrib- uted  to  the  pre-Hellenistic  period  have  now  been  shown  to  be modern  forgeries  (Nicolet-Pierre  and  Amandry  ( 1992)). 525.Telos  (Telios)  Map  61.  Lat. 36.30,long.  27.20.Size of territory: 2  ( 63  km \u00b2).Type:  B.  The  toponym  is  ,  (Hdt. 7.153.1;  Ps.-Skylax 99;  IG i\u00b3  71.ii.145).  An  alternative  toponym is (Hsch. 280;  Steph.  Byz. 621.1;  cf.  Callim.  fr. 581).  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  284.12;  RivFil 70  15.1 (c. 300)).  Telos  is  not  explicitly  called  a  polis  until  C 3f(IG  xii.3 29.6),  but  an  unpublished  arbitration  of  c. 300  strongly  sug- gests  polis  status  in  C 4s  (infra),  and  membership  of  the  Delian League  indicates  polis  status  in  C 5s.  The  collective use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  the  arbitration  of  c. 300 (supra)  and  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (supra). The  external  and  individual  use  is  attested  in  an  epitaph  from Mesambria  Pontica  (SEG 47  1075  (C 5\u00adC4)). Ps.-Skylax 99  lists  Telos  in  his  chapter  on  Karia  among  the inhabited  islands  near  Rhodos.  According  to  Strabo,  it belonged  to  the  Sporades  ( 10.5.14),  whereas  Steph.  Byz. assigns  it  to  the  Kyklades  ( 620.22). Telos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Ionian  district  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.145)  and  is  recorded  in  the  trib- ute  lists  by  city-ethnic  (IG i\u00b3  284.12),  but  in  the  assessment decree  of 425/4  by toponym (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.145).  It is recorded twice,  in  427/6  or 426/5  (IG i\u00b3  284.12)  and  in  415/14  (IG i\u00b3 290.i.27)  paying  an  unknown  amount.  Telos  was  assessed  for tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.145)  ( 2  tal.)  and  in  410/9  (IG i\u00b3 100.ii.5  ( 1  tal.),  but  city-ethnic  almost  completely  restored). Telos  was  under  Spartan  control  from  404  until  liberated  in 394  by  Pharnabazes  and  Konon;  it  remained  independent  of Rhodos  (no. 1000)  throughout  C 4  (Diod. 14.84.3  with  L. Robert ( 1969\u00ad90)  i. 569\u00ad74;  for  absorption  by  Rhodos  in  C 3, see  Papachristodoulou  ( 1989)  46\u00ad47). An  unpublished  Koan  arbitration  for  Telos  of  c. 300 includes  a  civic  oath  in  which  the  citizens  swear  to  stand  by the  existing  political  organisation  (politeuma),  to preserve the  damokratia,  and  not  to  oppose  the  damos  (RivFil 70  no. 15;  cf.  Rhodes,  DGS 290). The  cult  of  Athena  Polias  and  Zeus  Polieus  is  epigraphi- cally  attested  in  C 3e  (IG xii.340.9;  cf.  SEG 3715.8  (second century  ad))  and  probably  to  be  connected  with  the  obverse types  of  the  C 4  coins  (infra;  Fiehn  ( 1934)  430).  A  C 4  dedica- tion  inscribed  [  ] testifies t o a  cult  of  Poseidon (IG xii.337). The  town  was  situated  in  the  northern  part  of  the  island and  was  apparently  the  only  settlement.  So  far  no  traces  have been  found  of  villages,  hamlets  or  even  isolated  farmsteads (Hoepfner  ( 1999)  170).  Remains  of  the  city  walls  are  still extant  (Dawkins  ( 1905\u00ad6)  1\u00ad3);  they  have  been  dated  to  the Hellenistic  period  (Hope  Simpson  and  Lazenby  ( 1970) 63\u00ad66)  or  in  C 4  (Scranton  ( 1941)  172;  Hoepfner  ( 1999)  174) and  seen  as  part  of  Mausolos'building  programme  (Bean  and Cook  ( 1957)  142;  Hornblower  ( 1982)  331\u00ad32;  sceptical: Sherwin-White  ( 1978)  70  n. 212).  On  the  acropolis  are remains  of  a  tower  and  the  sanctuary  of  Athena  Polias  (Fiehn ( 1934)  427;  Lauffer  ( 1989)  653).  The  walls  enclosed  an  area  of just  over  10  ha,  but  the  town  lay  on  a  steep  slope  and  most  of the  houses  had  to  be  built  on  terraces.  There  cannot  have  been more  than  c. 150  houses  in  the  town  (Hoepfner  ( 1999)  185). Telos  struck  bronze  coins  in  C 4s.Types:  obv.  head  of  Zeus, or  of  Athena  (on  some,  head  of  Athena  with  aegis  outspread behind);  legend: ;  rev.  crab;  legend: and  sometimes  magistrate's  name  (Head,  HN \u00b2642). Telos  joined  Lindos  in  colonising  Gela  (Hdt. 7.153.1;see supra 192). 525. ", "Brykous": "Identifier: 488. , (Brykountios) Map  60  (inset).  Lat. 35.50, long. 27.10.  Size  of  territory:  presumably  1  or 2.  Type:  A.  The toponym is ,-  (IG xii.1  995  (first c entury  ad); IG i\u00b3  282.iv.9\u00ad10,  completely  restored).  The  city-ethnic  is (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.139)  or  (IG xii.1  220.3 (Hell.);  IG i\u00b3  100.ii.4,  restored).  Inscriptions  (IG xii.1 994\u00ad1009  (C 2  and  later))  secure  identification w ith  modern Ag.  Ioannis,  with  remains  from  the  Archaic  through  the  late Roman  period,  including  a  city  wall  of  the  late  Classical  or Hellenistic  period  (Hope  Simpson  and  Lazenby  ( 1962) 161\u00ad62),  but  Susini  ( 1963\u00ad64)  233  gives  no  date  for  the  fortifications.  It  follows  that  Brykous  is  one  of  the  three poleis  referred to by tripolis  at  Ps.-Skylax  99  and  thus  attested  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  of  the  term.  The  collec- tive  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  late the  aegean  745 inscriptions  (IG xii.1  994\u00ad95  (first c entury  ad))  and  exter- nally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.139).  The  indi- vidual  use  is  attested  both  internally  (IG xii.11000\u00ad9)  and externally  (IG xii.1  220  (Hell.)). Brykous  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League  and  is recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  mostly  by  city-ethnic  but  once probably  by toponym  (IG i\u00b3  282.iv.9\u00ad10)  from  448/7  (IG i\u00b3 264.iii.17)  to  429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.iv.9\u00ad10)  a  total  of  three  times, once  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 500  dr.  (IG i\u00b3 264.iii.17).Brykous  is  absent  from  the  full  panel  of 441/0  (IG i\u00b3  271.i\u00adii.64\u00ad86),  and  in  429/8  it  paid  the  phoros  of  that  year and  the  preceding  year  (IG i\u00b3  282.iv.9\u00ad10).It  was  assessed  for tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.139)  ( 500  dr.)  and  perhaps  also  in 410/9  (IG i\u00b3  100.ii.4).  The  sanctuary  of  Poseidon  Porthmios was  presumably  in  the  territory  of  Brykous;  perhaps Poseidon  was  the  chief  deity.  Inscriptions  starting  in  the Hellenistic  period  attest  to  a  temple  of  Athena  Lindia  on  the acropolis:  that  is,  in  the  period  when  Karpathos  was  con- trolled  by  the  Rhodians  and  formed  part  of  the  Rhodian state  (IG xii.1997\u00ad98).  On  the  unlikely  possibility  that  the island  of  Saros  was  part  of  the  territory  of  Brykous,  see under  Saros,  infra. 488.

The  toponym  is  '  (e-ta-li- o-ne  ( ') in C5  syllabic  inscriptions  such  as  ISC 217\u00ad18;  Steph.  Byz. 326.6).  The  city-ethnic  is  ' (syllabic  e-ta-li-e-we-se:  ICS 217.2).  Idalion  appears  as  a kingdom,  \"Edil\",  in  the  lists  of  Esarhaddon  and Ashurbanipal  (Borger  ( 1956)  no. 60.63).  The  C 5m  syllabic inscription  ICS 217  (Mitford  and  Masson  ( 1982)  72)  men- tions  the  basileus  Stasikypros  and  the  of  Idalion. Both  contribute  to the  emoluments  of  physicians,  and  this seems  to  imply  that  the  ptolis  had  a  separate  treasury.  Thus  here  seems  to  have  a  political  meaning,  although  it does  not  follow  from  the  extant  text  that  the  king  and  city shared  the  government  of  Idalion,  as  is  sometimes  assumed. In  line 1  referring  to a  siege  of  the  city, is  used  in  the urban  sense;  and  Idalion  is  likely  to  be  one  of  the  unnamed poleis  mentioned  in  the  urban  sense  by  Hdt. 5.115.The \u00b2  Masson  ( 1964)  210\u00ad31;  Nicolaou  ( 1976c);  Buchholz  ( 1977). \u00b2  Collombier  ( 1991)  38.

Idalion  joined  the  Ionian  Revolt  and  was  besieged  and taken  by  the  Persians  (Hdt. 5.115.1\u00ad2).  The  inscription  ICS 217  records  a  siege  of  Idalion  by  \"Medes  and  Kitians\"(its  date is  disputed,  between  c. 478  and  c. 445,  if  not  later);  but  the siege  was  unsuccessful,  as  King  Stasikypros  still  ruled  when the  inscription  was  set  up.  Thus  these  operations  cannot have  been  connected  with  the  conquest  of  Idalion  by  the Phoenicians  during  the  reign  of  King  Ozbaal  of  Kition,  who seems  to  have  ruled  shortly  after  the  middle  of  C 5  (the  pre- cise  chronology  of  these  events  and  of  the  kings  of  Kition  is still  disputed:  Collombier  ( 1991)  34\u00ad35;  Maier  ( 1994)  310).  It is  also  open  to  debate  whether  Idalion  was  incorporated  into the  kingdom  of  Kition  or  ruled  in  personal  union  only.  In any  case,  Phoenician  influence followed political c onquest: Phoenicians  lived  at  Idalion,  as  their  tomb  inscriptions  tes- tify;  Phoenician  deities  were  worshipped  in  the  city.  The  city seems  to  have  suffered  a  major  destruction  at  the  end  of  C 4 (Stager  and  Walker  ( 1989)  466;  Hadjicosti  ( 1993)),  but  sur- vived  into  Hellenistic  and  Roman  times. The  principal  (western)  acropolis  was  fortified already in the  Archaic  period,  and  thus  was  possibly  affected  by  the Persian  siege  of 498/7.  At  the  end  of  C 6  the  whole  city, including  both  citadels  (an  area  of  c. 40  ha),  was  enclosed  by a  fortification wall w ith  rectangular  bastions  (stone  founda- tion  with  mudbrick  superstructure),  which  was  rebuilt  at least  twice  and  remained  in  use  until  c. 300  (Stager  and Walker  ( 1978),  ( 1979),  ( 1989)  13\u00ad57,  462\u00ad64;  Hadjicosti ( 1994),  ( 1995)).  A  large  building  on  the  western  acropolis may  have  served  in  the  Archaic  period  as  a  palace,  and  in  the Classical  period  as  the  administrative  centre  of  Idalion  with archives  (C 4  ostraka,  with  mainly  Phoenician,  but  also  some syllabic  and  alphabetic  Greek  texts;  Masson  ( 1992); Hadjicosti  ( 1994),  ( 1995);  Stager  and  Walker  ( 1989)  5\u00ad13, 462\u00ad64).  It  remains  to  be  seen  whether  the  \"alignments  sug- gestive  of  an  overall  building  plan\"  observed  so  far  do  con- stitute  \"evidence  for  town-planning\"  in  C 5  (Stager  and Walker  ( 1989)  463). The  main  cult  of  Idalion  was  that  of  Aphrodite  (Theoc.  Id. 15.100\u00ad3;Verg.  Aen. 1.681,  692\u00ad93,  10.51\u00ad52;  Catal. 36.11\u00ad12, 64.96).  A  court  sanctuary  of  the  \"Great  Mother\",  identified by  the  Greeks  with  Aphrodite,  and  a  C 8\u00adC4  open-air  sanc- tuary  of  Apollo  Amyklos,  the  Phoenician  \"Reshef  Mikal\", were  situated  on  the  eastern  acropolis  (Masson  ( 1968a); Senff  ( 1993);  Gaber  ( 1997)  137).

It  is  called  a  polis  in the  political  sense  by  Solon  fr. 19.2,  West,  and  Aesch.  Pers. 892;  in  the  urban  sense  by  Hdt. 5.115.2  and  Ps.-Skylax  103. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in Solon  fr. 7.1,  Diehl,  and  Hdt. 5.110,  113.2. Soloi  was  founded,  according  to  Strabo  14.6.3,  by  the Athenians  Phaleros  and  Akamas.  Soloi  took  part  in  the Ionian  Revolt,  and  King  Aristkypros  was  killed  in  the  battle of  Salamis  (Hdt. 5.104.1,  by  implication);  the  city  was besieged  and  taken  by  the  Persians  in  498/7  (Hdt. 5.115.1\u00ad2). That  the  city  was  afterwards  for  a  time  controlled  by  a \"Persophile  king\"  of  Marion  remains  an  unproved  hypoth- esis  (Maier  ( 1985)  36\u00ad37,(1989a)  18;  Collombier  ( 1991) 31\u00ad32).  In  391  it  was  allied  with  Amathous  (no. 1012)  and Kition  against  Euagoras  I  of  Salamis  (Ephor.  fr. 76;Diod. 14.98.2;  Maier  ( 1994)  314\u00ad15):  after  the  Cypriot  rulers  had sided  with  Alexander  the  Great  in  332  (Arr.  Anab. 2.20.3; Plut.  Alex. 24.2),  King  Pasikrates  acted  as  choregos  at Alexander's  victory  celebrations  in  331  (Plut.  Alex. 29.2);  his son  Nikokles  served  as  trierarchos  on  the  Indian  expedition (Arr.  Ind. 18.1\u00ad2.8  (r 326)).  In  323/2  King  Stasikrates  was appointed  theorodokos  to  host  theoroi  from  Nemea  (Miller ( 1988)  148.9\u00ad10). Solon  is  said  to  have  counselled  King  Philokypros  to transfer  the  city  from  the  hill-top  position  of  Aipeia  down into  the  coastal  plain  (Plut.  Sol. 26;  cf.  Hdt. 5.113.2).  The  city must  have  been  walled  before  499/8,since  it  took  the  Persian army five months t o defeat  it  (Hdt. 5.115.2),  but  no  remains of  the  fortifications have been discovered thus far.  A  large, well-constructed  C 5l\u00adC4  building  on  a  prominent  site above  the  Roman  theatre  has  been  identified t entatively  as  a royal  palace  (de  Gagniers  and  Tam  Tinh  ( 1985)  XXII;  Maier ( 1989a)  16).Remains  of  Archaic  and  Classical  buildings  have been  traced  in  the  lower  city  (Nicolaou  ( 1976b)  851);  an Archaic  temple  has  been  excavated  on  the  acropolis (Gjerstad  ( 1937)  412\u00ad15).

Thus  we  cannot  be  certain  that  Hdt. 5.115.implies  a  siege  and  conquest  of  Kourion  by  the  Persians in 498/7;  no  remains  of  city  defences  of  this  period  have  been discovered  so  far.  In  332  King  Pasikrates  joined  Alexander the  Great  at  the  siege  of  Tyros  and  lost  his  quinquireme  (Arr.

The  protecting  god  of  Kourion  was  Apollo  Hylates (I.Kourion 41,  104,  etc.;  Strabo  14.6.3).

The  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5 (Hdt. 5.104.1\u00ad2)  or  \u00b5  (ICS 323  (C 5)).  Salamis appears  as  a  kingdom,  \"Silli\",  in  the  lists  of  Esarhaddon  and Ashurbanipal  (Borger  ( 1956)  no. 60.67).  It  is  called  a  polis  in the  political  sense  at  Aesch.

The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally in  Hdt. 5.104.1\u00ad2  and  internally  on  coins  of  King  Nikodamos (C 5e?):  syllabic  se-la-mi-ni  ( \u00b5  ( )) in ICS  323;  the individual  use  is  found  externally  in  Hdt. 5.108.1  and  SEG 29 296  (C 5). The  Greek  dynasty  of  Salamis  traced  its  ancestry  back  to the  legendary  hero  Teukros,  son  of  Telamon,  king  of  the Greek  Salamis  (Pind.  Nem. 4.46\u00ad48;  Paus. 1.3.2,  2.29.4; Pouilloux  ( 1975)  111\u00ad15).  Salamis  joined  the  Ionian  Revolt (Hdt. 5.104\u00ad15)  after  King  Gorgos  had  been  expelled  by  a  fac- tion  (stasiotai)  led  by  his  younger  brother  Onesilos  (Hdt. 5.104).  The  desertion  of  its  war  chariots  led  to  the  defeat  of the  Cypriots  in  the  battle  of  the \u00b5 (Hdt. 5.110),  but  Salamis  was  granted  exemption  from  the retaliatory  measures  of  the  Persian  army  (Hdt. 5.115.1).  At  the end of the Athenian operations in the eastern Mediterranean  in 450/49,  a  combined  action  on  land  and  sea was  fought  off  Salamis  (Thuc. 1.112.4;Isoc.  8.86).  King Euagoras  I  ( 410\u00ad374/3)  strengthened  the  fortifications, enlarged  the  harbour  and  built  a  fleet  of  triremes  (Isoc. 9.47).  In 351/0\u00ad350/49  Salamis  was  besieged  by  Persian  forces (Diod. 16.42.3\u00ad9,  46.1\u00ad3).  King  Pnytagoras  joined  Alexander the  Great  in  the  siege  of  Tyros  in 332  and  lost  his  quin- quireme  (Arr.  Anab. 2.22.2);  in 331  he  acted  as  choregos  at Alexander's  victory  celebrations  (Plut.  Alex. 29.1).  His  son Nitaphon  served  as  trierarchos  on  the  Indian  expedition (Arr.  Ind. 18.1\u00ad2.8  (r 326)).  In 323/2  King  Nikokreon  was appointed  theorodokos  to  host  theoroi  from  Nemea  (Miller ( 1988)  148.3\u00ad4).  King  Euagoras  I  was  given  Athenian  citizen- ship  in 410  or 409;  he  was  made  proxenos  in 393/2  (Pouilloux ( 1975)  117\u00ad18;  Maier  ( 1994)  313\u00ad14). The  monumental  remains  of  Archaic  and  Classical Salamis,  besides  the  sumptuous  \"princely\"  C 8\u00adC7  dromos tombs  (Karageorghis  ( 1969)  23\u00ad150  and  ( 1967\u00ad71)),  are scanty.  They  consist  mainly  of  a  short  section  of  the  south- ern  defences  which  possibly  included  a  gate.  The  stone  and mudbrick  wall  was  erected  in  the  Archaic  period  on Protogeometric  foundations  (C 11?),  and  destroyed  by  fire in C 6  (Jehasse  ( 1980)).  Inside  the  wall  the  remains  of  a  sanctu- ary  of  the  \"Great  God  of  Salamis\",  dating  to  the  same  period, were  discovered;  a  C 5\u00adC4  rural  sanctuary  of  the  Great Goddess  was  situated  outside  the  walls  to  the  west  of  the  city (Yon ( 1993)  144\u00ad46). The  most  important  cult  of  Salamis  was  that  of  Zeus Salaminios,  said  to  have  been  founded  by  Teukros  and regarded  by  Tacitus  as  nearly  as  prominent  as  that  of  the Paphian  Aphrodite  (Ann. 3.62.4). The  kings  of  Salamis  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Persian standard  from  c. 530/20  (Euelthon)  to  c. 310  (Nikokreon,  who also  used  the  Rhodian  standard).  Denominations:  stater and  fractions  down  to  twelfth.  From  411  coins  of  gold  and bronze  were  struck  too.

Whether  and  when  the  kings  of  Marion  were  lords  of  the palace  of  Vouni  and  dominated  Soloi  (no. 1021)  from  there  is  still  open  to debate  (Hill  ( 1949)  123;  Nicolaou  ( 1976d); Maier  ( 1985)  36\u00ad37;  Collombier  ( 1991)  31\u00ad32;  Reyes  ( 1994) 92\u00ad94;Nielsen  ( 1994)  54\u00ad61).Marion  must  have  been  a  walled city,  most  likely  already  in  498/7,  and  certainly  in  449,  when  it was  besieged  by  the  Athenians.

The  kings  of  Marion  struck  coins  of  silver  and  later  also  of gold  and  bronze  on  the  Persian  standard  from  C 5e  (Sasmas) to c. 312  (Stasioikos  II,  who  used  the  Rhodian  standard  for some  of  his  coins).

Paphos  took  part  in  the  Ionian  Revolt  and  was  besieged and  taken  by  the  Persians  (Hdt. 5.115.1\u00ad2).  Elaborate  siege and  counter-siege  works  recovered  by  excavation  allow  a detailed  reconstruction  of  the  operations  (Maier  and Karageorghis  ( 1984)  194\u00ad203;  Maier  ( 1996)  125\u00ad27).  A Paphian  contingent  of  twelve  ships,  commanded  by Penthylos,  fought  in  the  Persian  fleet of 480  (Hdt. 7.195). Paphos  became  an  ally  of  Alexander  the  Great  in  332  (Arr. Anab. 2.20.3,  by  implication). The  kings  of  Paphos  traced  their  origin  to  the  legendary founder-king  Kinyras;  they  alone  in  Cyprus  combined political  power  with  the  cult  functions  of  high  priest  of Aphrodite  (Maier  ( 1989b)).  Two  syllabic  inscriptions  of King  Nikokles  (ICS 8;AAP  4,237)  are  fragments  of  oaths,  but do  not  (as  suggested  by  Mehl  ( 1996a)  141)  represent  a  kind  of treaty  between  the  king  and  his  subjects. Paphos  was  defended  by  a  circuit  of  walls  with  rectangu- lar  towers,  built  in  C 8l  and  maintained  until  about  300 (remodelled  C 6l,  repaired  C 4m:  Maier  and  Karageorghis ( 1984)  128\u00ad70,  209\u00ad12;  Maier  and  von  Wartburg  ( 1985) 153\u00ad55;  cf.

A large  C 6\u00adC5  ashlar  building,  reminiscent  of  Achaemenid prototypes,  seems  to  have  been  a  royal  palace;  a  large  C 4s peristyle  mansion  may  have  served  public  functions (Sch\u00e4fer  ( 1960);  Maier  ( 1989a)  17).  An  imposing  chamber tomb  was  the  burial  place  of  two  C 4s  kings  of  Paphos, Timocharis  and  Echetimos  (Maier  and  von  Wartburg  ( 1998) 105\u00ad10;  AAP 5). Aphrodite,  the  \"Wanassa\"  of  the  syllabic  inscriptions,  was the  protective  goddess  of  Paphos  (Hom.  Od. 8.362\u00ad66; Hymn.  Hom.  Ven. 56\u00ad67).  Her  main  shrine  was  an  open court  sanctuary  (C 12  to  fourth  century  ad),  but  of  its Archaic  and  Classical  period  only  votive  statuettes  survive (Maier  and  Karageorghis  ( 1984)  182\u00ad83;  Maier  and  von Wartburg  ( 1985)  155\u00ad56).  Outside  the  intricate  north-east gate  stood  an  Archaic  sanctuary,  dedicated  possibly  to Aphrodite/Astarte  and  Melquart/Baal  and  destroyed  in 498/7  (Maier  and  Karageorghis  ( 1984)  186\u00ad92). The  kings  of  Paphos  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Persian standard  C 6l\u00adc.325;  Nikokles  (c. 325\u00adc.309)  used  the  Attic standard.

The  cult  of  Aphrodite  and  the  Archaic  sculp- ture  of  Paphos  show  definite Phoenician influences,  but traces  of  Phoenician  presence  are  lacking  so  far  (Masson and  Sznycer  ( 1972)  81\u00ad86). 1020.

Polis  in  the political  sense  is  found  in  SEG 16  789  (C 4l/C3e).  The  syllab- ic  inscriptions  of  Amathous  show  indeed  that  a  thus  far undeciphered  language  (\"Eteokyprian\")  was  written  (and spoken?)  there  (Masson  ( 1983)  203\u00ad6;  but  see  Reyes  ( 1994) 13\u00ad17);  a  Phoenician  element  is  also  attested,  especially  in  the Archaic  period  (Hermary  ( 1997)).  The  collective use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  Hdt. 5.104.2. Amathous  sided  with  the  Persians  in  the  Ionian  Revolt. The  city  must  have  been  fortified b y  then,  as  it  was  besieged by  Onesilos  of  Salamis  and  successfully  defended  (Hdt. 5.104\u00ad8,  114).  In  391  it  was  allied  with  Soloi  (no. 1021)  and Kition  against  Euagoras  I  (Ephor.  fr. 76;Diod.  14.98.2).  King Androkles  joined  Alexander  the  Great  during  the  siege  of Tyros  in  332  and  lost  his  quinquireme  (Arr.  Anab. 2.22.2). During  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  the  acropolis and  the  lower  town  were  defended  by  a  city  wall  with  rectan- gular  towers  (Hermary  ( 1993)  174\u00ad75;  Aupert  and  Hermary ( 1995)  95;  Aupert  ( 2000)  47\u00ad52);  the  defences  enclosed  c. 18 ha.  The  main  architectural  remains  on  the  acropolis  consist of  a  large  public  building  (a  palace?),  rebuilt  several  times between  C 8m  and  c. 300,  and  the  open  court  sanctuary  of Aphrodite,  C 8m  to  first c entury  ad  (Hermary  ( 1993)  175\u00ad76, 183\u00ad87,(1997)  88;  Aupert  and  Hermary  ( 1995)  90\u00ad93;Aupert ( 2000)  52\u00ad55,  59\u00ad63). The  \"goddess  of  Amathous\"  was  Aphrodite,  often  called \"Kypria\"  or  \"Aphrodite  Kypria\"  (Catal. 36.11\u00ad14,  68.51;Verg. Aen. 10.51;Ov.  Met. 10.220\u00ad42;  Paus. 9.41.2  mentions  an \"ancient  sanctuary  of  Adonis  and  Aphrodite\").  The  epony- mous  hero  Amathous,  son  of  A\u00ebrias,  the  founder  of  the Paphian  shrine  of  Aphrodite,  is  said  to  have  founded  the sanctuary  of  the  Amathousian  Venus,  one  of  the  three  oldest shrines  in  Cyprus  (Tac.  Ann. 3.62.4).  Another  tradition makes  the  Amathousians  descendants  of  \"companions  of Kinyras,  who  had  been  put  to  flight b y  the  Greeks  who accompanied  Agamemnon\"  (Theopomp.  fr. 103).

In  the  Classical  period  Orikos  was  probably  part  of  the peraia  of  Korkyra  mentioned  by  Thuc. 3.85.2.  The  collective use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  a  Korkyraian decree  of  C 3l  (I.Magnesia 44.46  IG ix\u00b2.1  1196)  and  inter- nally  in  a  C 3  oracle  inquiry  (IG ix  12  4.  1203)  and  on  C 3\u00adC2 coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2314\u00ad15;  Hammond  ( 1967)  639). According  to  the  ancient  sources,  Orikos  was  situated  on the  Ionian  coast  near  the  Acroceraunian  mountains  at  a  distance  of 80  miles  from  Salentinum  (Plin.  HN 3.145);  the site  has  been  identified w ith  the  ancient  remains  found  on an  island  in  the  southern  part  of  the  Gulf  of  Valona,  which already  in  Antiquity  became  connected  with  the  mainland (Plin.  HN 2.204),  i.e.  modern  Pascha  Liman  (Hammond ( 1976c)).  Orikos  is  situated  on  a  small  promontory  which  is easily  defensible  on  the  landward  side.  The  settlement  cov- ered  an  area  of 5  ha  (Corvisier  ( 1991)  287).  The  archaeologi- cal  remains  are  scarce.

Byz. 499.22.Hellenistic  coins  bear an  abbreviated  form  of  the  city-ethnic: (Head  HN \u00b2 321;  Dakaris  ( 1971b)  169).  Pandosia  is  classified as a polis  in the  urban  sense  by  Dem. 7.32  and  by  Theopomp.  fr. 206.  It  is also  regarded  as  being  a  colony  of  Elis  (no. 251)  (Dem. 7.32). Pandosia  was  a  polis  belonging  to  the  Kassopians (Theopomp.  fr. 206),  who  in  turn  formed  a  section  of  the Thesprotians  (Strabo  7.7.5,  6.1.5).  In  C 4s  Pandosia  was  a dependency  of  Kassopa  (no. 100).  Pandosia  is  recorded  in the  C 4m  list  of  theorodokoi  from  Epidauros  (IG iv\u00b2.195.24). An  oracle  from  Dodona,  misinterpreted  by Alexander  I, shows  that  Pandosia  was  built  on  three  hills  near  the Acherusian  lake  and  the  river  Acheron  (Strabo  6.1.5)  and was  situated  in  the  region  of  Kassopaia  (Dem. 7.32;Strabo 7.7.5).  On  the  basis  of  the  literary  sources,  Hammond (( 1967)  477\u00ad78,  674\u00ad75,  with  map)  identified P andosia  with Gourana  near  modern  Trikastro  (accepted  by  Barr.). Dakaris,  on  the  other  hand,  combined  the  thesis  of  Leake (( 1835)  4.55,  73,  75)  with  that  of  Philippson  ( 1956)  106  and identified P andosia  with  the  ancient  remains  of  a  site  near Kastri:  a  rounded  hill  in  the  middle  of  the  Acheron  plain  ris- ing  to a  height  of 107  m  between  Kanalikon  and  Ephyra. Contrary  to  the  ancient  description,  the  Acheron  flows t o the  south  of  this  hill.  Dakaris  counters  this  objection  with the  suggestion  that  the  course  of  the  Louros  has  changed and  that  in  Antiquity  the  river-bed  was  on  the  southern  side of  the  hill  (Dakaris  ( 1971b)  164). Pandosia  was  connected  with  the  sea  by  the  Acherusian lake  and  the  navigable  river  Acheron.  Dakaris  believes  that  a port  existed  on  the  south  side  of  the  lake  at  Dromos Skalomatos,  where  oak  keels  of  ancient  vessels  have  been found.  Another  port  may  have  existed  on  the  north  side  of the  lake  near  the  south  wall  of  Pandosia,  because  ancient metal  rings  were  formerly  affixed t o  the  rocks  for  tying  up epeiros  347 small  ships.  The  bridge  mentioned  by  Plin.  HN 4.1.4  proba- bly  linked  the  main  settlement  on  Kastri  hill  with  the  two northern  hillocks  (Dakaris  ( 1971b)  170). The  site  was  settled  from  the  prehistoric  period (Corvisier  ( 1991)  201).  The  way  Philip  besieged  and  pillaged the  land  of  the  colonists  (Dem. 7.32)  was  one  normally adopted  against  walled  cities.  Therefore  the  conquest  of Pandosia  by  Philip  II  ( 343/2)  constitutes  the  terminus  ante quem  of  the  older  walls.  This  date  is  in  accordance  with  the style  of  the  walls  and  the  political  role  Pandosia  played  at this  time.  Dakaris  suggests  that  Pandosia  was  fortified between  C 5l  and  343/2;  the  polygonal  enclosure  encom- passed  an  area  of 13.1  ha  (Dakaris  ( 1971b)  167).  The  settle- ment  is  divided  into  two  parts  by  an  inner  wall  (ibid. 167 with  fig. 42;  cf.  AR  ( 2000\u00ad1)  67).  The  wall  was  reinforced with  twenty-two  towers  and  had  two  gates  on  the  eastern side,  the  southern  one  leading  to  the  Acherousian  lake (Dakaris  ( 1971b)  167  with  fig. 42).  From  the  very  few  remains of  buildings  it  is  impossible  to  reconstruct  the  city  plan (ibid. 168).  The  nature  of  the  terrain  makes  it  most  unlikely that  the  city  was  grid-planned  (ibid. 167).  On  the  hill-top two  large  cisterns  are  preserved  (ibid. 169\u00ad70). 105.

A  C 4m  manumission  inscrip- tion  naming  the  eponymous  prostates  of  the  Thesprotians testifies t o  the  importance  of  this  town  already  in  the Classical  period  and  shows  that  Gitana  belonged  to  the Thesprotian  tribal  community  (SEG 26  717). According  to  the  C 4m  manumission  inscription,  Themis was  worshipped  in  Gitana  (SEG 26  717);  Tzouvara-Souli ( 1979)  appendix  fig. 1  mentions  a  cult  of  Aphrodite  but  does not  suggest  any  date. Gitana  is  situated  near  Philiates  on  the  north-west  side  of the  limestone  mountain  Brysella  at  the  confluence of  the Kalpakiotikos  and  Kalamas,  which  was  navigable  up  to  this point  (Dakaris  ( 1972)  35).  According  to  Polyb. 27.16.4\u00ad6, Gitana  was  situated  c. 16  km  from  the  sea.

The  rough  breathing  is  attested  in the  Latin  form  Horreum  (Livy  45.26.4). epeiros  345 Horraon  is  not  explicitly  classified as a polis  in  any  source; but  in  a  decree  of  c. 330,  a  citizen  of  Horraon  is  recorded among  the  hieromnemones  of  the  Molossian  koinon (Cabanes  ( 1976)  539\u00ad40  no. 3;  cf.  BCH 109  ( 1985)  522).  It  follows  that  Horraon  was  a  member  of  the  koinon  and probably  a  polis  in  the  political  sense.  The  collective  use  of the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  a  C 2m  treaty  (SEG 35 665A.24).  The  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested externally  in  a  C 4  manumission  document  (Cabanes  ( 1976) 586  no. 70).

The  earliest  evidence  of  Batiai  as  a  polis  is  Theopomp.  fr. 206,  where  Batiai  is  mentioned  together  with  Elateia  (no. 94),Pandosia  (no. 104)  and  Boucheta  (no. 90)  as  .  Since  these  three  sites  are  mentioned  by Dem. 7.32  as  being  colonies  of  Elis  (no. 251),  it  seems  reason- able  to  suppose  that  Batiai  too  was  an  Elean  colony.  Batiai was  a  polis  belonging  to  the  Kassopians  (Theopomp.  fr. 206), who  in  turn  formed  a  section  of  the  Thesprotians  (Strabo 7.7.5).  In  C 4s  Batiai  was  a  dependency  of  Kassopa  (no. 100). Batiai  is  identified w ith  the  ruins  of  the  Kastri  hill  3  km south  of  Rizovouni  (Podogora), 3.5  km  east  of  the  modern village  of  Thesprotiko  (plain  of  Lelovo),  an  advantageous position  controlling  the  plain  and  the  main  route  to  central Epeiros  (Dakaris  ( 1971b)  183).  The  construction  of  a  poly- gonal  wall  around  the  hill  makes  good  use  of  the  natural  for- mation  of  the  ground.  Its  construction  is  dated  to  the  period after  343/2.  It  was  1,400  m  in  circumference  and  enclosed  an area  of 10.1  ha  (ibid. 185).  The  principal  northern  side  (main entrance)  was  protected  by  large  towers.  Four  other  gates have  been  identified in the north-east,  south,  south-west and  north-west  corners  (ibid. 186  figs. 45\u00ad46).  Traces  of  a polygonal  wall  are  also  visible  inside  the  town,  indicating  the existence  of  a  walled  acropolis  (ibid.).  In  the  northern  part  of  the  acropolis  is  preserved  a  wall,  which  may  have enclosed  a  shrine  or  a  temenos  (ibid.).  Four  cisterns  have been  found  with  a  total  capacity  of  about  300\u00ad400  m \u00b3 (ibid.).  Dakaris  ( 1971b)  87  states  that  it  is  impossible  to determine  the  specific functions of  the  buildings  inside  the town. 89.  [Berenike] Map 54.  Lat. 39.02,long.  20.45.

The  town  was  situ- ated  at  modern  Michalitsi  (Dakaris  ( 1971b)  fig. 30,  pace Barr.).  The  place,  however,  was  fortified already in C 4s (Dakaris  ( 1971b)  fig. 30).  Dakaris  ( 1971b)  51  supposes  that Berenike  was  a  seaport  of  Kassopa  (no. 100)  in  addition  to the  one  at  modern  Kastrosykia.  Therefore  the  precursor  of Berenike  can  perhaps  be  recognised  as  a  dependent  polis from  C 4s,  viz.  a  dependency  of  Kassopa. 90. ", "Nikaia": "Identifier: 102. , Map 49.

According  to  Ps.-Skylax  30,  Elea  was  just  a  harbour ( \u00b5),  but  the  archaeological,  numismatic  and  epigraph- ical  record  reveals  that  in  C 4s  Elea  must  have  been  a  polis. Franke  ( 1961)  301\u00ad2  suggests  that  Elea  was  a  colony  of Corinth  (no. 227).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  internally  on  C 4s  coins  (infra).  The  individual  use of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  a  C 4s  manumis- sion  inscription  from  Dodone  (no. 93)  which  records  the name  of  a  witness  from  Elea  (SGDI 1351). Elea  was  situated  in  the  region  of  Elaiatis  which,  in  turn, was  part  of  the  region  of  Thesprotia  (Thuc. 1.46.4;  Ps.- Skylax 30).This  is  confirmed b y  a  C 4s  manumission  inscrip- tion  from  Dodona  recording  an  '  among  the Thesprotian  witnesses  (SGDI 1351). Dakaris  ( 1972)  97  identifies  Elea  with  Charauge  (near modern  Veliani)  on  the  slopes  of  the  Korila  and  describes  it as  a  fortified  settlement  of 10  ha  (Dakaris  ( 1987)  75).  Gates are  visible  in  the  south-western  and  eastern  part  (Dakaris ( 1972)figs.  42  and 43).  The  city  was  grid-planned  and  had an  agora  (Dakaris  ( 1971b)  184),  a  Hellenistic  theatre  compa- rable  in  size  to  the  small  theatre  of  Kassopa  (no. 100),  and two  stoas  to  the  west  and  east  of  the  theatre  (Dakaris 344 funke,  moustakis  and  hochschulz ( 1971b)  178,(1972)figs.  42  and 43),  probably  of  the Hellenistic  period.

The  city-ethnic  is  (Paus. 9.36.3). Ephyra  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Thucydides in  a  passage  where  he  explicitly  distinguishes  between  the polis  Ephyra  and  its  harbour  Cheimerion  ( 1.46.4).  Like  Elea, Ephyra  was  situated  in  the  region  of  Elaiatis,  which  in  turn was  part  of  the  region  of  Thesprotia  (Thuc. 1.46.4). Thucydides'  description  of  Ephyra  as  lying  inland  and above  the  harbour  has  led  to  the  identification of  Ephyra with  the  ancient  settlement  at  Xylokastro  near  modern Likouresi, 800  m  north  of  the  junction  of  the  river  Kokkytos with  the  Acheron.  This  site  was  inhabited  from  the  pre- historic  period  and  was  already  in  LH  III  a  fully  developed settlement  with  a  fortified acropolis enclosing an area of 4.24  ha  (Dakaris  ( 1972)  80  fig. 40);  the  settlement  was  the same  size  in  C 4  (ibid. 115).  A  gate  has  been  found  in  the  southern  part  (ibid.  fig. 40).  The  identification of  the ancient  remains  on  the  opposite  hill  (Dakaris  ( 1993b))  with the  Nekromanteion  mentioned  in  Hdt. 5.92 is  now  unten- able  in  the  light  of  Baatz  ( 1999),  who  shows  that  the  excavat- ed  building  was  an  aristocratic  residence  erected  between C 4l  and  C 3l,  whereas  the  Nekromanteion  must  have  been situated  at  the  foot  of  the  hill  instead. 97.

Phoinike  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Polyb. 2.5.5 and 2.8.4.  Polis  status  in  C 4  is  strongly  indicated  by  the  epi- graphical  and  archaeological  record:  an  oracle  inquiry  of C 4l/C3e  from  Dodone  (no. 90)  filed b y   is  ascribed  to  Phoinike  (Dakaris  et al.( 1993) 58  SEG 15  397.4).  Phoinike  seems  to  have  been  the  political centre of  the  Chaonians  from  C 4m  (Cabanes  ( 1976)  115\u00ad16). Phoinike  is  recorded  in  the  C 4s  list  of  theorodokoi  from  Argos (SEG 23  189;  Charneux  ( 1966a)  156\u00ad239,(1966b).

Phoinike  has  been  identified w ith  the  ancient  site  on  the hill  above  modern  Finik  in  southern  Albania,  where  a  small walled  acropolis  of  about  1.5  ha  can  be  traced  back  to  C 5 (Corvisier  ( 1991)  218;  Budina  ( 1986)  119:  6  ha).

In  most cases  it  is  impossible  to  determine  whether  the  evidence concerns  the  polis  Kassopa  or  the  region  Kassopia.

According  to  Strabo  7.7.5,  the  Kassopaians  were Thesprotians,  and  c. 330\u00ad325  they  became  members  of  the Epeirote  Federation  (Hoepfner  and  Schwandner  ( 1994) 116).  From  C 4m  Kassopa  was  the  political  centre  of  the region  and  is  recorded  in  the  C 4m  list  of  theorodokoi  from Epidauros  (IG iv\u00b2.195.25).  The  attested  political  institutions are  all  of  the  Hellenistic  period  (SEG 15  383  (C 2)).  A  C 3\u00adC2 honorific decree passed b y  the     (SEG 35  671)  suggests  that  there  was  a  popular  assembly.  The archaeological  evidence  (infra)  indicates  that  these  institu- tions  existed  already  in  C 4  (Hoepfner  and  Schwandner ( 1994)  119). Kassopa  is  identified w ith  the  remains  of  an  ancient  set- tlement  near  modern  Kamarina.  Situated  on  the  slopes  of Mt.  Zalongo,  Kassopa  had  a  dominating  position  with  a superb  view  of  the  Gulf  of  Ambrakia.  The  C 4m  defence  cir- cuit  enclosed  an  area  of 30  ha  (Hoepfner  and  Schwandner ( 1994)  123).  The  agora  is  situated  south  of  the  main  road,  in the  westernmost  part  of  the  town.  The  place  was  probably chosen  because  of  its  magnificent v iew.  The  town  was  grid- planned,  and  the  west  side  of  the  agora  was  probably  from the  beginning  reserved  for  public  buildings.  The  open  ekkle- siasterion  of  C 3l  (Hansen  and  Fischer-Hansen  ( 1994)  62\u00ad63) most  likely  had  a  predecessor  in  the  form  of  a  natural  the- atre.  A  temple  of  Aphrodite  was  built  about  C 4m  (Hoepfner and  Schwandner  ( 1994)  120\u00ad45  figs. 94  and 95).  The  main deity  of  the  town  seems  to  have  been  Aphrodite  (coins (infra),  temple,  SEG 15  383  (C 2)).  A  C 4\u00adC3  theatre  is  located in  the  western  part  of  the  city  (TGR  ii. 231).

Elateia  was  a  polis belonging  to  the  Kassopians  (Theopomp.  fr. 206),  who  in turn  formed  a  part  of  the  Thesprotians  (Strabo  7.7.5).In  C 4s Elateia  was  a  dependency  of  Kassopa  (no. 100). Elateia  controlled  the  plain  east  of  the  river  Louros  and also  the  northern  highland  region  (Dakaris  ( 1971b)  173).The location  of  Elateia  has  been  much  in  dispute  (cf.  Dakaris ( 1971b)  n. 456).  Hammond  ( 1967)  477\u00ad78  and  Dakaris ( 1971b)  171  locate  it  convincingly  at  the  foot  of  Mt.  Zalongo north  of  the  village  Paliorophoro.  This  site  was  settled  from prehistoric  times.  Probably  colonists  established  themselves on  the  north  side  of  the  hill,  where  the  most  ancient  remains of  buildings  have  been  found  (Dakaris  ( 1971b)  172).  Dakaris (ibid.) 172  suggests  that  in  C 5l  the  settlement  was  fortified with  a  polygonal  wall  of 1,690  m  in  circumference,  which enclosed  an  area  of 12.7  ha  corresponding  to  a  population  of about 3,800.  The  main  gate  was  in  the  south-east  leading  to the  Louros  plain  and  Boucheta  (no. 90),a  second  gate  was  in the  south,  a  third  in  the  east,  and  a  fourth  in  the  north  (ibid. 174).  There  were  at  least  two  cemeteries  outside  the  main section  of  the  walled  town  (ibid. 176).  The  uneven  nature  of the  terrain  necessitated  the  construction  of  terraces  and  the building  of  tiered  streets.

The  only reason  to include  Tekmon  in  this  inventory  is  the  site-classifi- cation  in  Steph.

Hammond,  however, (( 1997)  31)  prefers  to identify  this  site  with  Eurymenai  (no. 97).  The  site  was  settled  from  the  prehistoric  period (Dakaris  ( 1951),  ( 1952)).

In  Ptolemy's  list  Torone  is  recorded  between  the  mouth  of the  Thyamis  and  Sybota.  Accordingly,  Dakaris  ( 1972)  115 with  fig. 49  locates  Torone  on  a  peninsula  in  the  northern part  of  Sybota  Bay  (  modern  Lygia)  and  suggests  that  the site  belonged  to  the  peraia  of  Korkyra  (no. 123),  referred  to by Thuc. 3.85.2.  This  place  was  settled  from  the  Archaic  peri- od.  Probably  in  C 5  the  open  settlement  was  transformed into  a  small  fortified acropolis of 1.2  ha.  It  expanded  to  the south  and  west;  by  427  it  had  grown  to  21.5  ha,  and  in  C 4  it covered 58  ha  (Corvisier  ( 1991)  205\u00ad6;  Dakaris  ( 1972)  115  figs. 49\u00ad51).  Three  parts  can  be  distinguished:  part  A,  fortified already  before  427  with  gates  to  the  south,  east  and  west (ibid.  fig. 51);  part  B,  also  fortified before  427  with  a  gate probably  in  the  east;  and  part  C,  fortified after  427  with  a  gate in  the  west  (ibid.  fig. 50). 111.

In C 4s  Boucheta  was  a  dependency  of  Kassopa  (no. 100). According  to  tradition,  Boucheta  was  situated  in  the Kassopaia  at  the  river  Louros  at  a  short  distance  from  the sea.  Dakaris  ( 1971b)  177  fig. 9  and  Hammond  ( 1976a)  locate it  on  a  secluded  hill,  where  ruins  of  the  Byzantine  castle  of Rogoi  are  visible,  on  the  right  bank  of  the  river  Louros.  This 342 funke,  moustakis  and  hochschulz was  an  advantageous  position  near  the  Ambrakian  Gulf,  to which  Boucheta  was  connected  by  the  navigable  Louros. Dakaris  ( 1971b)  178  suggests  that  Boucheta  was  the  port  of Elateia  (no. 94)  and  Batiai  (no. 88). The  site  was  settled  from  prehistoric  times.  Corvisier ( 1991)  201  suggests  that,  already  in  the  Archaic  period, 0.75 ha  was  fortified.  By  C 5l  an  isodomic  wall  with  eight  towers had  been  built  and  enclosed  an  area  of 1.5  ha.  The  only  gate was  in  the  north-west  corner  (Dakaris  ( 1971b)  181  fig. 47). When  in  C 4f  the  settlement  extended  westward,  the  wall with  interval  towers  was  increased  and  now  enclosed  up  to 3.5  ha,  with  a  population  of  about  1,000.  The  gateway  was situated  on  the  western  side  (ibid.). The  visible  remains  of  the  urban  structure  have  been destroyed  by  building  activity  in  mediaeval  and  modern times;  the  only  traces  are  of  a  large  ancient  building  on  the southern  foothill  which  can  be  followed  for  about  80  m;  it might  be  a  stoa-shaped  structure  which  probably  served  as  a wharf  or  shipyard  of  the  navigable  river  (ibid. 182\u00ad83  fig. 47). 91.

This  territory  corre- sponds  quite  well  with  the  tradition  (Strabo  7.5.8;  Ptol.  Geog. 3.13.4). Byllis  was  part  of  the  Atintania  (Ceka  ( 1987)  141,  map). Ptol.

Ceka ( 1987)  137  traces  the  origin  of  the  koinon  back  to C 4m.  The Bylliones  acted  for  the  first time as a political unit c.C 4m, when  they  posed  an  oracle  inquiry  to  Dodone  (Dakaris  et al. ( 1993)  56). The  town  of  Byllis  was  situated  at  the  right  side  of  the Aoos,  at  modern  Gradisht.  It  was  fortified in C 4m  (Ceka ( 1990)  221).  The  wall  enclosed  an  area  of 28  ha  (Corvisier ( 1991)  288).

Dodone  is  situated  22  km  south-west  of  modern Ioannina  at  the  foot  of  Mt.  Tomaros  (Dakaris  ( 1993a)  6). The  acropolis  was  surrounded  by  a  C 4  polygonal  wall  which enclosed  an  area  of 3.4  ha  (Dakaris  ( 1971a)  72\u00ad73).  It  had  ten towers,  two  main  gates  (in  the  north-east  and  south-west) and  a  small  gate  in  the  south  (Dakaris  ( 1993a)  34\u00ad35).On  the acropolis  some  foundations  of  buildings  and  a  rectangular cistern  hewn  out  of  the  rock  are  noticeable,  but  not  yet  com- pletely  excavated  (Dakaris  ( 1971a)  75). The  main  sanctuary  was  situated  below  the  acropolis.  The central  cult  site  was  the  prophetic  oak.  In  C 5l  the  first t emple was  built,  simple  in  construction  with  pronaos  and  cella (Evangelidis  and  Dakaris  ( 1959)  27;  Dakaris  ( 1960)  6; Dieterle  ( 1999)  ch.  iii. 1). The  Molossian  and  Epeirote  federal  coins  had  among other  types  the  head  of  Zeus  Dodonaios  and  Dione,  eagle, thunderbolt  or  oak  leaves,  all  referring  to  the  oracle  at Dodone.

Byz. 487.5); (dat.)  at  Xen.  Hell. 6.4.24  and (acc.)  at  6.5.25  could  be  masculine  or  neuter;  the assumption  that  the  nominative  is     may  have  no foundation  other  than  similarity  with  the  Attic  deme.  At Paus. 8.27.4,however, (nom.)  is  a  likelier  emendation than (Pikoulas  ( 1987)  137,  148,(1988a)  145  n. 445,  239, following  Niese  ( 1899)  540  n. 1).  The  city-ethnic  is   (Xen.  Hell. 6.5.26).  (Paus. 8.45.1  refers  to ,a \u00b5  of Tegea  (no. 297)  in  early  times;  it  may  refer  to  the  same  place.) Attestations  of  Oios  as  a  polis  are  only  post-C 4  and implicit.  Paus. 8.27.4  (r 371)  may  combine  the  topographical and  political  senses. The  only  attested  collective  external  use  of  the  ethnic  is  at Xen.  Hell. 6.5.26,where  he  calls  it  a  \u00b5  (Hansen  ( 1995a)  74). At Hell. 6.5.24  Xenophon  assigns  Oios  to Lakonike;at 6.5.24,  25,  specifically t o  Skiritis.  It  is  the  only  settlement explicitly  included  in  Skiritis  in  any  source  (Pikoulas  ( 1987) 135).  In  Paus. 8.27.4  (r 371),  if  correctly  read,  Oion  is  an Aigytian  and/or  Skiritan  polis;  but  Skiritis  had  probably been  subsumed  under  Aigytis  by  then. Oios  was  possibly  at  Ai-Gianni  Kerasias  (Kerasia  was  for- merly  Arvanitokerasia;  Loring  ( 1895)  60  and  n. 141;  Pikoulas ( 1987)  135\u00ad37  and  n. 35;  cf.

Hell. 6.5.26  mentions  that  attacking  Arkadians  went  up  on  to  the roofs  of  houses  (   ).(See also LS  ii. 283,dd43.) If  correctly  identified,  Oios  may  have  existed  only  in  the Classical  period. 340. ", "Kythera": "Identifier: 338. , (Kytherios) Map  58.  Lat. 36.15,long.  23.05. Size of  territory: 4  ( 262  km \u00b2).  Type:  A.  (S 4).  The  island (called at  Hdt. 7.235.2  and    at 1.82.2)  and  the  town  were  homonymous,  so  the  toponym was ,  (Ps.-Skylax  46:   ).  The city-ethnic  is  (Thuc. 4.54.1,  the  earliest  evidence for  the  town;  IG ii\u00b2  9110,C4e). Kythera  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skylax 46.  There are  many  references  to a      in the  urban  sense  (e.g.  Thuc. 4.54.1  and  Xen.  Hell. 4.8.8),  but  it appears  that  no  source  uses  polis  in  the  political  sense  about the  community,  surely  by  coincidence.  Its  politeia  was  the subject  of  an  Aristotelian  treatise  (Heracl.  Lemb. 54;  Arist. no. 88,  Gigon). The  external  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  in Ephor.  fr. 2  (apud  Ath. 352C)  and  IG ii\u00b2  9110  (C 4e);  the  exter- nal  collective use  occurs  in  Thuc. 4.54.1,  2;Xen.  Hell. 4.8.8; RO 96.48,  52  (Kyrene, 330\u00ad326),  a  record of  grain  donations by  Kyrene  (no. 1028)  to  the  Kytherioi  amounting  to  8,100 medimnoi. Ps.-Skylax 46  places  Kythera  in  Lakedaimon.  Thuc. 4.53.2 and  perhaps  7.26.2  seem  to  imply  that  Lakonike  does  not include  Kythera,  though  usually  it  includes  all  places  under Spartan  control;  at  4.53.2  he  locates  Kythera  the  island  oppo- site  Lakonike  ( ...    ).  The  territory of the  polis  is (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.7).  Its  inhabitants  are Lakedaimonians  and  perioikoi,  but  used  (in  C 5l?)  to be administered  by  a  magistrate  called  the  kytherodikes  and were  garrisoned  (Thuc. 4.53.2).  According  to  Hdt. 1.82.2,  the island  had  been  taken  from  the  Argives  prior  to  C 6m.For  the strategic  importance  of  the  island  to  Sparta  (no. 345),  see Hdt. 7.235.2. The  polis  was  on  the  homonymous  island,  c. 10  stades (c. 1.8  km)  inland  (Paus. 3.23.1)  at  Palaiokastro  (Huxley ( 1972)  38\u00ad39;  Cartledge  ( 1979)  122).Xen.Hell.4.8.8  mentions the  fortification walls of  the  polis;  cf.  Huxley  ( 1972)  38\u00ad39. The  second  settlement  on  the  island  was  (  )  (KlPauly  v. 221;  RE  iiiA. 438),  probably  at  Palaiopolis Kastriou;  post-Bronze  Age  archaeological  evidence  begins in  C 6  (Huxley  ( 1972)  34).  Skandeia,  the  epineion  of  Kythera according  to  Paus. 3.23.1,  is  called      at Thuc. 4.54.1  (to  be  contrasted  with   ,i.e.Kythera town  itself,  at  4.52.2)  and       \u00b5 \u00b5  at 4.54.4;  it  is  apparently  thought  of  as  a  part  of  Kythera  town and  not  as  a  polis  in  its  own  right  (Hansen  ( 1995b)  43\u00ad44; Shipley  ( 1997)  227\u00ad28;  see  also  the  note  by  Hansen  in CPCActs 4:  173\u00ad75).  Hdt. 1.105.3  mentions  the  famous  sanc- tuary  of  Aphrodite,  which  was  at  Palaiokastro  (Waterhouse and  Hope  Simpson  ( 1961)  148ff;  alternative  location:  Huxley ( 1972)  35  with  fig. 6,pl.4).(The  island  was  the  mythical  place of  arrival  of  the  goddess  (Hes.

In 424,  the  Athenians  with  allies  attacked  Kythera  (Thuc. 4.53.1),  captured  Skandeia  ( 54.1),  and  defeated  the Kytherians  in  battle  outside  the  city  ( 54.2);  there  had  already been  contact  between  the  Athenians  and  some  of  the Kytherians  before  the  attack  ( 54.3),  and  soon  after  the  battle an  agreement  was  reached  ( 54.4, \u00b5):  the  Athenians took  over  Skandeia  and  placed  a  garrison  in  the  city  of Kythera  (ibid.).  A  little  later,  the  Kytherians  were  enrolled  in the  Delian  League  on  the  conditions         (Thuc. 4.57.4); they  are  not,  however,  named  in  the  extant  tribute  quota lists.  The  Athenian\u00adSpartan  treaty  in  Thuc. 4.118.4  stipulates that  the  Athenians  on  Kythera  are  not  to  have  dealings  with Peloponnesian  League  members  ( \u00b5  \u00b5\u00b5     \u00b5\u00b5).  The  Peace  of  Nikias  stipulated  that  the Athenians  restore  Kythera  to  the  Lakedaimonians  (Thuc. 5.18.7);  however,  Kytherian  forces  joined  the  Athenians  in the  attack  on  Syracuse  (Thuc. 7.57.6),  so  \"it  had  evidently not  been  evacuated  by 413\"(HCT  iv:  399  ad 7.26.2).  In  393, Pharnabazos  landed  on  Kythera;        left  the  fortifications and w ere  sent  hypospondoi to Lakonike,  whereupon  Pharnabazos  had  the  teichos repaired  and  left  a  garrison  and  the  Athenian  Nikophemos as  harmost  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.8). According  to  Thuc. 7.57.6  the  Kytherians  were  Dorians and  colonists  ( ) of  the  Lakedaimonians.  They  had the  capacity  to  organise  themselves  militarily  during  the Peloponnesian  War  (Thuc. 4.54.1,  cf. 7.57.6). IG v.1937  (SEG 11  896  (C 4))  is  a  dedication  to  the Tyndaridai  by an \u00b5,  perhaps  the  Spartan Kytherodikes  (Cartledge  ( 1979)  244)  or  possibly  an  Athenian commander  (cf.  Xen.  Hell. 4.8.8;MacDowell ( 1986)  30). 337.Las  (Laos) Map  58.  Lat. 36.40,long.  22.30.  Size  of  ter- ritory: 1?  Type:  A.  (S 5).  The  toponym  is  ,  (Ps.-Skylax 46);  alternatively ,  (Thuc. 8.91.2,  92.3).  Steph.  Byz. 404.5 lists  the  feminine,  but  comments  ( 6\u00ad7) .S ometimes  it  is  unclear  which  is  being  declined: e.g.  at  Hom.  Il. 2.585,  the  earliest  mention.  The  city-ethnic in  Steph.  Byz. 404.9  is  confirmed b y  coins  of ad 193\u00ad211  (Head,  HN \u00b2  436)  and  Horos 10\u00ad12  ( 1992\u00ad98)  564 (Hadrianic). Las  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skylax  46 (   \u00b5). Paus.  at  3.24.6  locates  Las  40  stades  ( 7  km)  \"right\"  (i.e. west)  of  Gytheion  (no. 333)  and  10  stades  ( 1.8  km)  from  the sea;  at  3.24.8  it  is  c. 30  stades  (c. 5.5  km)  from  Hypsoi,  which  is at  the  edge  of  Spartan  territory.  It  was  probably  near Chosiari,  on  the  hill  with  the  Frankish  castle  of  Passava  (so Barr.,  following  S 5);  in  the  land  beneath  the  acropolis, Classical  finds have been noted ( LS  ii. 300,  ll153; Giannakopoulos  ( 1987)  52\u00ad54  and 51  fig. 12  notes  Archaic finds from Chosiari). Las  is  explicitly  assigned  to  Lakonike  by Thuc. 8.91.2.Its territory  would  have  been  bounded  on  the  east  by  that  of Gytheion  (cf.  Paus. 3.24.6),on  the  west  by that  of  Pyrrhichos ( 3.25.2).  Paus. 3.24.7  refers  to the  spring  of  Galako,  which presumably  existed  earlier;  his  sanctuaries  of  Asklepios  and Artemis  Daphnaia  at  Hypsoi  ( 3.24.8),  and  of  Diktynna Artemis  on  a  cape  ( 3.24.9),  need  not  be  Classical,  but  the tomb  of  the  hero  Las  at  nearby  Arainos  ( 3.24.10)  is  more likely  to  be. The  acropolis  has  produced  Protogeometric  to  Roman finds,  including  a  late  Archaic  or  early  Classical  votive  stele (IG v.11217).Paus.3.24.6  says  that  the  city  was  formerly  on  the summit  of  Asia,  where  the  ruins  of  the  old  city  and  its  fortifi- cation  walls  were  situated.  A  stretch  of  polygonal  walling  has been  found  (Forster  ( 1906\u00ad7)  232\u00ad34;  cf.  Traquair  ( 1905\u00ad6) 262  fig. 3),  suggesting  that  Passava  is  Mt.  Asia. On  the  acropolis  was  Pausanias'  ruined  temple  of  Athena Asia  ( 3.24.7);  it  could  be  Classical,  as  could  his  \"ancient\" statue  of  Hermes  (ibid.).  His  temples  of  Dionysos  and  of Asklepios  on  Mt.  Ilion,  and  of  Apollo  Karneios  by Knakadion,  need  not  be  old,  though  Apollo  Karneios  is  a classic  cult  of  Laconia.  His  story  of  the  oecist  Las,  buried  at Arainos  ( 3.24.10),  may  have  a  Classical  origin. According  to  Ephor.  fr. 117  apud  Strabo  8.5.4,  Las  was  euli- menos,  and  Ps.-Skylax  mentions  a  limen;  Thuc. 8.91.2,  92.3, mentions  naval  activities  at,  presumably,  this  harbour.  The harbour  of  Las  was  probably  at  Vathy  Bay,  where  there  are Roman  remains  (Forster  ( 1906\u00ad7)  233).  This  is  supported  by the  location  of  the  tomb  of  the  founding  hero,  Las,  on  the promontory  of  Arainos  (Paus. 3.24.10),  probably  modern Ageranos  on  the  south  side  of  Vathy  Bay  (Waterhouse  and Hope  Simpson  ( 1961)  118  n. 28). 338. ", "Anthana": "Identifier: 326. , Map 58.  Lat. 37.20,long.  22.50.  Size  of  terri- tory: 1?  Type:  A.  (S 1).  The  toponym  is  ,  (Thuc. 5.41.2;Lys.  fr. 21,  Sauppe).  In  the  Doric  dialect  it  is   (Steph.  Byz. 95.11),  which  is  a  plausible  restoration  (in  place of ) in Ps.-Skylax 46.  The  city-ethnic  is attested  (or  was  invented)  by  Steph.  Byz. 95.15. Anthana  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Thuc. 5.41.2, and  presumably  by  Ps.-Skylax  46  (accepting  for ). Thuc. 5.41.2  places  Anthana  (with  Thyrea)  in  Kynouria, and  says  it  was  a  Lakedaimonian  possession  in  C 5l ( \u00b5  ... \u00b5);  Harp.  s.v.  (quoting  Lys.  fr. 31 for  the  toponym)  puts  it  in  Lakonike,  and  Ps.-Skylax  (as restored,  supra)  in  Lakedaimon;  Paus. 2.38.6  seemingly  in Thyreatis.  It  will  have  remained  Spartan  until  338,  when Philip  II  assigned  some  Spartan  territory  to  Argos  (no. 347) (Shipley  ( 2000)  371,376\u00ad77);  it  may  never  have  been  retaken. Given  that  its  location  is  disputed,  the  extent  and  borders  of its  territory  must  remain  uncertain.  Several  possible  loca- tions  have  been  proposed  in  Thyreatis,  the  northern  part  of Kynouria,  the  area  long  disputed  by  Sparta  and  Argos  (cf. Thuc. 5.41.2).  Tsiorovos  and  Nisi  Agiou  Andrea  both  have Classical  to  Roman  pottery  (Shipley  ( 1997)  226  no. 1;  cf. 230\u00ad31  no. 10;  see  also  under  Neris,  supra 575),  but  Frazer ( 1898)  iii. 309  points  out  that,  if  we  read  in \u00b2  References  to komai  are  assembled  by  Shipley  ( 1997)  261\u00ad63.  The  only  pre- Hellenistic  reference  to  a  kome  is  Xenophon's description  of  S 16,  Oion  (Hell. 6.5.25).The  inhabitants  of  S 101,Tyros,described  their  town  as  a  kome  in 275.Two settlements  are  described  as  komai  in  Hellenistic  sources:  S 22,  Belbina  (C 1 papyrus,  perhaps  quoting  Phylarchos)  and  S 65,  Helos  (Strabo).  Pausanias  adds the  rest:  S 1,  Anthana;  S 30,  Eua;  S 96,  Glyppia;  S 97,  Krokeai;  S 98,  Neris;  S 99, Pleiai/Palaia;  and  S 100,  Selinous. \u00b2  On  local  settlement  hierarchies,  see  Shipley  ( 1992). 578 shipley Ps.-Skylax 46,it  would  be  a  coastal  place;  this  would  rule  out Tsiorovos.  (On  the  problems  of  identification,  see  summary in  Shipley  ( 1993)  132\u00ad33.)  Barr.'s  location,  \"on  Mt.  Zavitsa\", presumably  derives  from  the  possible  location  of  Athana  at Tsiorovos,  a  village  2  km  west\u00adsouth-west  of  the  mountain (cf.  Phaklaris  ( 1990)  41  fig. 3). According  to  Paus. 2.38.6,  Anthana  was  formerly  inhabit- ed  by  Aiginetans;  these  would  be  the  ones  who  in  C 5l  also settled  at  nearby  Thyrea  with  the  permission  of  the Lakedaimonians  (Thuc. 2.27.2),  as  Pausanias  is  aware ( 2.29.5). Whether  Anthana  is  Nisi  Paraliou  Astrous  or  Nisi  Agiou Andrea,  it  was  a  fortified acropolis in late Classical and early Hellenistic  times  (for  Nisi  Paraliou  Astrous,  see  Shipley  LS  ii. 277,  aa6;  Phaklaris  ( 1990)  56\u00ad78;  Waterhouse  and  Hope Simpson  ( 1961)  131;  Goester  ( 1993)  91\u00ad93,  99;  for  Nisi  Agiou Andrea,  see  Shipley  LS  ii. 279,  aa19;  Phaklaris  ( 1990)  47\u00ad55; Goester  ( 1993)  84\u00ad88,  97\u00ad98). 325.  Aphroditia,  Aphrodisia Unlocated.  Type:  C.  (S 83). The  toponym  is  ,  (Thuc. 4.56.1  codd.),  perhaps best  emended  to  the  laconizing  ,  as  by  Herodian (repeated  by  Steph.  Byz. 150.24),  less  plausibly   (Paus. 3.22.11,  8.12.8;  Steph.  Byz. 150.17).  A  city-ethnic  is  not attested.  Aphroditia's  location  is  unknown  (LS  ii. 312\u00ad13, nn251),  but  was  presumably  in  the  same  region  as  Etis  and Side,  the  other  two  poleis  from  which  Boia  is  said  to  have been  synoecised  (Paus. 3.22.11). In Thuc. 4.56.1,Aphroditia  is  a  coastal  place  with  a  guard- post.  The  only  reference  to it  as  a  polis  is  Paus. 3.22.11  (retro- spective  but  referring  to  legendary  times),  apparently  in both  the  topographical  and  the  personal/political  senses (repeated  by  Steph.  Byz. 150.17).  Steph.  Byz. 150.24  seems  to infer from Thuc.Aphroditia may still have existed in C 4m  or  later  (see  Boia  (no. 327)).The  only  reason  for  includ- ing  it  here  is  analogy  with  Side,  which  was,  according  to Paus. 3.22.11,  like  Aphroditia  synoecised  into  Boia,  presum- ably  in  C 4s;  Side  is  described  as  a  polis  (in  the  urban  sense) by  Ps.-Skylax 46  and  was,  then,  a  polis  before  the  synoecism; Aphroditia  may  possibly  have  been  one  as  well.  See  further Boia  (no. 327),  Etis  (no. 330)  and  Side  (no. 344). The  name  implies  a  cult  of  Aphrodite.  Paus.  ( 3.22.11, 8.12.8)  says  the  town  was  founded  by  Aineias.  It  is  not  attest- ed  after  C 4  (except  in  Paus. 3.22.11),  and  if  it  disappeared  as  a polis  by c. 300,both  cult  and  legend  should  predate  that  time. 326.

According  to  Paus. 3.24.4  its  name  was  '  before  the Lakedaimonians  took  it  over;  an  archaizing  or  poetic  form of  that  name, '  ,  appears  in  the  grave  epigram  IG v.1 723  (SEG 11  864.3  (C 3f  or  possibly  C 4s)).

Prasiai  is  called  a  polis  (kai  limen)  at  Ps.-Skylax  46,  using polis  in  the  urban  sense;  Thuc. 2.56.6  twice  calls  it  a  \u00b5 (cf.  Flensted-Jensen  ( 1995)  129\u00ad31;  Hansen  ( 1998)  21,  25), once  adding  .If  IG v.1723  (supra)  refers  to it, it  is  here  called  patris. The  territory  is  termed  by Thuc. 2.56.6.  The  C 7\u00adC5 sanctuary  of  Apollo  Tyritas  at  the  kome  of  Tyros  ( 11  km north  of  Plaka),  and  that  of  Apollo  Maleatas  at  Kosmas  in Mt.  Parnon,  may  both  have  lain  in  the  territory  of  Prasiai (unless  Tyros  was  a  polis).  Thuc. 2.54.6  assigns  Prasiai  to Lakonike,  Ps.-Skylax 46  to  Lakedaimon.  It  also  belonged  to Kynouria  (as  indicated  by  the  extent  of  this  area),  periodi- cally  disputed  between  Sparta  and  Argos  (Thuc. 5.14.4,41.2). By C 3l  it  was  Argive  again  (Polyb. 4.36.5;  Shipley  ( 2000)  378). Strabo  8.6.2  locates  it  on  the   ;  Pausanias calls  the  area  Lakonike  (e.g. 3.23.11). According  to  Strabo  8.6.14,  Prasiai  was  one  of  seven  cities in  the  Kalaureian  Amphiktyony,  the  Lakedaimonians  paying  their  dues  on  their  behalf  (presumably  after  they captured  Kynouria  in  C 6m).  This  perhaps  preserves  a  non- Lakedaimonian  ethnic  categorization  of  Prasiai  (OCD \u00b3 273). In 430,  Prasiai  was  captured  and  plundered  by  the Athenians  who  also  ravaged  its  territory  (Thuc. 2.56.6;  cf.  Ar. Pax 242);  it  was  raided  by  Athenian  forces  twice  again  later (Thuc. 6.105.2,  7.18.3).  In  366,  Peloponnesian  League  troops assembled  at  Prasiai  (Xen.  Hell. 7.2.2\u00ad3). Prasiai  was  200  stades  ( 37  km)  by  sea  from  Kyphanta  (no. 335)  (Paus. 3.24.3).  The  town  was  at  Paralia  Leonidiou,  with an  acropolis  at  Plaka,  south  of  Leonidi,  where  ancient remains  have  been  found;  there  has  been  no  systematic investigation  of  the  area.  Finds  from  c.C 7l  to  Roman  are  evi- dence  of  a  nucleated  settlement.  There  are  ancient  towers and  foundations  on  the  acropolis  hill  between  the  two  har- bours  (LS  ii. 282,  bb33;  Phaklaris  ( 1990)  129\u00ad37).  We  have  no Classical  evidence  of  cults,  but  Paus. 3.10.7  names  Ino  and Dionysos,  sanctuaries  of  Asklepios  and  Achilles  which  may be  Classical,  and  a  headland  cult  with  small  statues.  Paus. 3.24.3\u00ad4  gives  the  story  of  Semele  and  the  baby  Dionysos  in explanation  of  the  name  of  the  polis;  this  may  have  had  a Classical  origin. 343.

There  is  no  direct  evidence  for  Sellasia's  territory,  but Plut.  Agis 8.1  makes  it  one  of  the  boundaries  of  Spartan  ter- ritory  in  Agis  IV's  proposals.  Sellasia  is  placed  in  Lakonike  by Theopomp.  fr. 11,  if  correctly  reproduced  by  Steph.  Byz. ( 561.2\u00ad3).  The  phrase      is  deleted by editors  of  Xen.  Hell. 2.2.13;  perhaps  another  word (such  as ,  or \u00b5) stood before  (e.g.  ,    ). Paus. 3.10.7  places  the  ruins  on  the  main  road  just  before Thornax.  Polyaen. 3.11.6  probably  implies  that  Sellasia  was 586 shipley 200  stades  ( 37  km)  from  Sparta  (it  is  actually  20\u00ad25  km).

Konstantinos  ( b111,  late  Archaic  to middle  Hellenistic).  From  archaeological  evidence,  Sellasia was  probably  founded  in  C 6m  and  abandoned  in  C 3  (Catling ( 2002)  238\u00ad40).  It  was  seen  in  ruins  by  Pausanias  ( 3.10.7).

It  is  presumed  to  have  been a  perioikic  polis;  in  Thuc. 6.105.2  an  attack  upon  it  is  an attack  upon  the  Lakedaimonians.  Its  C 2  boundary  dispute with  Zarax  is  recorded  in  IG v.1931  (supra);  in  Paus. 3.23.6  its territory  marches  with  that  of  Boia  (no. 327).

Pausanias  records various  features  in  the  town  and  its  territory  ( 3.23.7\u00ad10).

The  obscure  polis of '  (Steph.  Byz. 283.6\u00ad7;  Shipley  ( 1997)  266  no. 114) may  be  a  doublet  of  Etis.

Paus. 3.22.13  (if  correctly  restored)  describes  Etis  as  in ruins.  It  may  have  disappeared  in  C 4m.

Hill ( 1917)  notes  an  Achaean  League  hemidrachm  with  the  leg- end (cf.  Nielsen  ( 1996b)  119\u00ad20;  SEG 35  287);  Phaklaris ( 1990)  103\u00ad4  doubts  that  the  coin  belongs  to  Eua.  (Steph.  Byz. 283.13)  may  be  an  invention. Eua  is  probably  Elliniko,  a  settlement  with  Geometric  to Roman  finds near A nemomylos,  the  findspot of  SEG 30  377. Anemomylos,  a  Classical  to  Roman  cult  site,  is  possibly  the sanctuary  of  Asklepios,  of  whom  a  statuette  was  found.  Less plausibly,  Eua  could  be  the  nearby  site  now  renamed  Eva (near  Moni  Loukous)  with  the  excavated  villa  of  Herodes Atticus  and  a  cult  of  Asklepios  (so  Phaklaris  ( 1990)  78\u00ad90, 96\u00ad104,  185\u00ad92);  but  Eva  is  mainly  Roman,  and  for  Pritchett not  a  nucleated  settlement  (( 1965\u00ad91)  vi. 87\u00ad89).(See  also  LS ii. 277,  aa5  Eva,  Moni  Loukous; 278,  aa10  Anemomylos, Elliniko; 278,  aa13  Elliniko;  Goester  ( 1993)  81\u00ad84,  100\u00ad6). It  is  possible  that  Eua  was  called  a  polis  by Theopomp.  fr. 60,  but  there  is  no  certainty  that  Steph.  Byz.  (the  source  of the  fragment)  is  not  adding  his  own  gloss.  The  city-ethnic  is used  individually  and  presumably  internally  on  the  C 4 gravestone  from  Phonemenoi  (SEG 13  267),  and  this  is  the primary  reason  for  its  inclusion  here  (cf.  Hansen  ( 1996)). The  Hellenistic  stamped  tile  cited  above  preserves  a  collec- tive  internal  use,  as  does  the  Achaean  League  coin.  The  city-ethnic  is  used  collectively  and  externally  in  the  Eleian treaty  of  c. 500,  if  it  refers  to  Eua  (see  supra). Pausanias  appears  to  place  Eua  in  Thyreatis.  It  will  have been  Spartan  between  C 6m  and  C 4m  (Shipley  ( 2000)  377). It  was  later  a  member  of  the  Achaean  Confederacy  (BCH 39 ( 1915)  118).  The  extent  and  borders  of  Eua's  territory  are uncertain,  but  it  will  have  included  the  important  cult  site  of Asklepios  at  modern  Eva,  which  may  have  had  a  late Classical  origin.  If  the  ethnics  all  refer  to  the  same  place,  and it  is  Elliniko,  it  has  a  long  life,  though  the  archaeological  evi- dence  suggests  late  Classical  and  Hellenistic  decline.  The nearby  sanctuary,  however,  may  have  continued  to  flourish. The  Hellenistic  stamped  tile  is  evidence  of  the  capacity  to take  a  communal  decision  about  a  building  project,  perhaps at  the  nearby  sanctuary.  Elliniko  also  has  fortification walls (Phaklaris  ( 1990)  78\u00ad90,  esp. 80\u00ad81). 332. ", "Geronthrai": "Identifier: 333. , (Geronthretes) Map  58.  Lat. 36.60,long. 22.45.

Synecd. 647.9, second  half  of  sixth  century  ad)).  The  city-ethnic  is (IG v.1  1111;  cf.

Geronthrai  is  first called a polis  in  the  political  sense  in  IG v.1  1111  (C 2s).  Paus. 3.2.6  (rC 8m)  says  it  was  a  perioikic  polis when  captured  by  King  Teleklos  (c. 760\u00ad740)  (Cartledge ( 1979)  109),  but  this  cannot  be  relied  upon.  If  the  name  lists IG v.11133\u00ad34  (infra)  are  public  records  of  athletic  victories by  people  (citizens)  of  Geronthrai  (Hodkinson  ( 1999) 156\u00ad57),  then  it  was  possibly  a  polis  by c. 500.  Decrees  of  the polis  use  the  city-ethnic  collectively  and  internally;  see  IG v.1 1111,  1113  (both  Hellenistic).  Externally  it  is  used  collectively by  Paus. 3.2.6. According  to  Pausanias,  the  Dorians  of  Lakedaimon under  Teleklos  replaced  the  Achaian  population  of  the  pre- Heraklid  settlement  with  from  among  their  own number  ( 3.22.6,  cf. 3.2.6).  The  probable  Archaic  and Classical  polis  was  presumably  perioikic.  It was  probably  lost to  Sparta  in  195  (Shipley  ( 2000)  379\u00ad80).Archaeological  and epigraphic  finds,  especially  the  name  lists  IG v.11133\u00ad34 (c. 500;  LSAG 201  no. 46,  SEG 11  918)  and  the  victory  stele,  IG v.1  1120  (C 5;  SEG 17  189  ),  found  on  the  acropolis,  make  the lakedaimon  581 existence  of  an  important  Archaic  and  Classical  settlement  a virtual  certainty.  In  the  Hellenistic  period  the  city  granted proxenies  with  various  combinations  of  rights  (IG v.1 1110\u00ad13). Two  sepulchral  inscriptions  commemorating  men  fallen in  battle  ( \u00b5  \u00b5) ma y  provide  evidence  of  Geronthriate military  forces  (IG v.1  1124  (  SEG 11  915,  33  313;  LSAG 202  no. 60  (C 5s))  and  1125  (  SEG 11  916,  33  313;  LSAG 201  no. 58 (C 4e));  see  Hodkinson  ( 2000)  250\u00ad54. Paus. 3.22.7  names  a  temple  of  Apollo  on  the  acropolis; Archaic  and  Classical  sculptures  may  derive  from  it  (Wace and  Hasluck  ( 1904\u00ad5);  Wace  ( 1904\u00ad5);  de  Waele  ( 1997) 77\u00ad81).  Excavations  have confirmed the e xistence  of  a Hellenistic  circuit  wall  and  of  Classical  and  Hellenistic buildings,  abandoned  in  C 3l  (Crouwel  et al.( 1995)  47\u00ad52, ( 1996)  90\u00ad98,(1997)  esp. 58\u00ad60,  63\u00ad65,  70,  72,(1999)  24, 25\u00ad33). IG v.1  1120  (C 5)  lists  athletic  victories,  but  the  name  and location  of  the  festival  are  missing.  Pausanias  and Hellenistic  votives  testify  to  cults,  but  none  need  be  early other  than  the  temple  of  Apollo  destroyed  by  fire (Paus. 3.22.7);  probable  capitals  and  votives  from  it  have  been found,  as  well  as  Archaic  to  Classical  votive  pottery,  relief sculptures,  and  architectural  fragments  (Crouwel  et al. ( 1995),  ( 1996),  ( 1997);  Wace and  Hasluck  ( 1904\u00ad5)).  IG v.1 1113  (Hellenistic)  refers  to  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo.  IG v.1  1118 is  a  C 3l/C2  votive  relief  to  Eleusia  (i.e.  Demeter);  her  cult may  have  existed  earlier. 333. ", "Gytheion": "Identifier: 334. , (Gytheates) Map  58.

No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  explicitly  calls  Gytheion  a polis,  but  is  seems  very  likely  that  Xen.

The  only  individual  internal  use  of  the  city- ethnic  is  IG v.1  1176  (Imperial  date).  The  only  individual external  use  is  IG v.1  1111  (C 2s);  in  Jalabert  ( 1904)  8\u00ad9,no.  5 (supra)  the  fuller  specification  \u00b5    is  used.  The  city-ethnic  is  used  collectively  and internally  in  IG v.1  1165  (C 2s)  and  on  Roman  coins;  exter- nally  in  IG v.11147  (SEG 15  222  ,  c. ad  122\u00ad135). Gytheion  is  placed  in  Lakedaimon  by  Ps.-Skylax 46; implicitly  in  Lakonike  by  Diod. 11.84.6  (r 456).  Tolmides  rav- aged  its  chora  in 456  (Diod. 11.84.6).  Paus. 3.21.6  locates Gytheion 30  stades  ( 5.5  km)  from  Aigiai,  on  the  sea,  and about  the  same  distance  from  Trinasos  ( 3.22.3).  Epigraphic and  archaeological  finds  confirm  the  site  as  the  modern town  of  Gytheio  (formerly  Marathonisi).  The  city  was evidently  fortified  in 370\u00ad369  (Xen.  Hell. 6.5.32,  quoted supra;  Ps.-Skylax 46: ).  Archaeological  finds,  howev- er,  begin  in  the  Archaic  period.  SEG 11  926  (C 5)isabronze goat  dedicated  to  Apollo--ineios  (Karneios?).

For  Hellenistic  cults  of  the  polis,  see  e.g.  IG v.1  1152 (C 2),  1144  (C 2/C1e).  Rescue  archaeology  has  brought  to light  Hellenistic  structures  and  many  more  of  Roman  date (AR 26  ( 1979\u00ad80)  32;  35  ( 1988\u00ad89)  31;  Roman  at  AR 38 ( 1990\u00ad91)  27  and  earlier).  See  generally  Giannakopoulos ( 1987);  LS  ii. 296\u00ad97,  jj218  . Gytheion  served  the  Lakedaimonians  as  naval  base:  Diod. 11.84.6  (r 456)  refers  to it  as  an  where  there  are (similarly  Paus. 1.27.5;  Cic.  Off. 3.11.49  (rC 5e)).

Two  different  toponyms  are  used  for  the  central  settlement of  Lakonike: ( 1) ,  ,(Hom.  Il. 2.582;  Tyrtaios  fr. 4.4;  Thgn. 785  Anon.  Megarensis  (c. 480);  Hdt. 1.68.5;  Thuc. 1.130.1, 4.3.2;Xen.  Hell. 7.1.28;  Ps.-Skylax 46;  SEG 22  460  post 369);  in Doric  (Alc.  fr. 360.2,  Liberman  (Aeolic);  Pind.

Sometimes  Homer  seems  to  think  of  Sparte as  an  area  (Od. 11.460),as  does  Pherekydes  (FGrHist 3)  fr. 168 (cf.  Oitylos  (no. 340)). ( 2) \u00b5,  (Hdt. 1.82.1),  also  a  word  for  the region  (see  supra 570).  It  was  already  the  name  of  the  settle- ment  in  the  late  Bronze  Age  (Hall  ( 2000)).  Lakedaimon, probably  in  the  sense  of  the  city  of  Sparta,  includes  the Amyklaion  (treaty  quoted  at  Thuc. 5.18.10).  For  Lakedaimon (without  ) as probably meaning the town,  see  Pind. Pyth. 4.49;  Hdt. 1.82.1;  Thuc. 1.43.1;Xen.  Hell. 2.3.8;  IG iv\u00b2.1 122.xxi.1  (C 4s);  Polyb. 8.33.8.  In  a  C 4l  dedication  by  a Lakedaimonian  victor  at  Olympia  (Syll. \u00b3  1069  IvO 171, 316),  Lakedaimon  is  said  to  be  660  stades  ( 121  km)  from Olympia,  which  should  refer  to  the  city  of  Sparta  rather  than its  territory.  See  further  Hall  ( 2000)  78\u00ad79. Sometimes  the  two  seem  to  be  combined  for  variety's sake:  Maiandrios  sails  \"to  Lakedaimon\"  (though  this  could be  the  region)  and  meets  Kleomenes  who  is  \"ruling  Sparta\" (Hdt. 3.148.1).  At  other  times  the  distinction  seems  deliber- ate:  if  Dorieus  had  remained  in  Sparta,  he  would  have  been king  of  Lakedaimon  (Hdt. 5.48).  On  other  occasions  the variation  seems  to  have  no  special  significance:  the  kings may  rule  in  Sparta  (Hdt. 1.65.1)  or  in  Lakedaimon  (Hdt. 1.67.1);  Ainesias  is  ephor  in  Sparta  (Thuc. 2.2.1),  Pleistolas  in Lakedaimon  (Thuc. 5.25.1). The  city-ethnic  also  has  two  versions: ( 1) (Thuc. 1.128.3,  2.25.2;Xen.  Hell. 3.3.5, 7.4.19);  Doric  (LSAG \u00b2446  no. 16a  (c. 550);  IvO 263  (C 6);  IvO 244  (C 6/C5e));  Ionic  (Hdt. 8.42.2,  9.54.2). ( 2) \u00b5  (Pind.  Pyth. 4.257;  Hdt. 1.6.2;  Thuc. 1.6.4;Xen.  Hell. 1.2.18;  SEG 11  1180a  (C 6f);  SEG 26  476  (C 6?); IvO 247  (C 6l/C5e);  ML  22  ( 490\u00ad480),  no. 67  (c. 427);  IG ii\u00b2 43.A.9  ( 378/7)). denotes  only  the  citizens  of  Sparta,  the dominant  polis. \u00b5  strictly  denotes  all Lakedaimonians  (Spartans  and  perioikoi),  but  today  it  is often  translated  as  if  Greek  authors  used  it  as  a  synonym  for \"Spartans\".  This  misconception  may  be  based  partly  on  the false  premiss  that  the  perioikoi  were  treated  almost  as  badly as  helots.  It  is,  of  course,  true  that  the  Spartans  held  almost all  decision-making  power  in  Lakonike;  and  when  Thuc. 1.10.2  comments  on  the  underdeveloped  physical  urban form  of  the  \"polis  of  the  Lakedaimonians\",  he  certainly means  the  town  of  Sparta.  Sparta  was  the  dominant  political community,  purporting  to  speak  for  all  Lakedaimonians; this  may  be  why  \"Lakedaimonians\"  often  appears  to  denote the  Spartans.  This  need  not  be  true  in  every  case,  however. When  Simonides,  in  his  epigram  on  Thermopylai  (Hdt. 7.228.2),  asks  the  passer-by  to  take  a  message  to  \"the Lakedaimonians\",  he  may  mean  what  he  says.  The  same  con- sideration  may  apply  to  Thucydides'  statements  that  the Lakedaimonians  do  not  make  their  allies  pay  tribute  but favour  oligarchies  ( 1.19.1),  and  that  it  was  Lakedaimonian fear  of  growing  Athenian  power  that  led  to  war  ( 1.24.5).  A telling  pairing  of  the  two  ethnics  is  at  Thuc. 1.128.3,where King  Pausanias  \u00b5  is  sent  for  by the lakedaimon  587 :  though  king  of  the  wider  Lakedaimonian community,  he  is  recalled  because  the  Spartans  will  it. The  claim  to  \"speak  for  Lakonike\"  may  explain  why  a Spartiate  abroad  is  usually  called  Lakedaimonios,  the  only epigraphic  exception  being  the  lion  dedicated  to  Hera  in Samos  by  Eumnastos  Spartiates  (Dunst  ( 1972)  140\u00ad44; LSAG \u00b2446  no. 16a  (c. 550)).  On  the  other  hand,  there  are  no demonstrable  examples  of  \"Lakedaimonios\"  being  used  as the  ethnic  of  an  individual  perioikos:  as  far  as  we  know,  he  is always  called  by  the  ethnic  of  his  own  polis  (e.g.  Gytheates, Oinountios;  Hansen  ( 1996)  185  and  n. 96;  Shipley  ( 1997) 209).  Therefore,  when  we encounter  \u00b5  indi- vidually,  we  can  probably  assume  it  means  a  Spartan.  Thus, in  IG xii.5542,a C 4m  catalogue  of  proxenoi  from  (presum- ably)  Karthaia  (no. 492),  while  three  citizens  of  perioikic poleis  of  Lakonike  are  listed  with  their  city-ethnics  ( 20\u00ad22),a Lakedaimonios  is  also  catalogued  ( 18),  and  he  ought  to  be  a Spartan,  as  ought  the  two  Lakedaimonians  attested  as  Eleian proxenoi  in  C 6  (SEG 11  1180a  (C 6f);  SEG 26  476  (C 6?))  and the  Lakedaimonian  sculptor  who  signed  Corinth viii.315 (C 5l\u00adC4e). The  short  form  (SEG 31  559  ( 369/8);  Arist.  Pol. 1271b28)  is  less  common.  It  is  sometimes  used  in  poetic  and colloquial  contexts  (Ar.  Ach. 305;  Hdt. 1.68.2)  or  for  variety. It  seems  to  be  interchangeable  with  \u00b5,but can  be  applied  specifically t o Spartiatai  (Xen.  An. 2.1.3,  5, 5.31)  as  well  as  to  Lakedaimonians  in  general  (cf.  Xen.  An. 5.1.15,  where  it  is  applied  to  a  man  explicitly  described  as being  a  perioikos). Both  Sparte  and  Lakedaimon  are  described  as  a  polis. ( 1)  Sparte:  A  rare,  perhaps  unique,  epigraphic  descrip- tion  of  Sparta  as  a  polis  is  in  Tod  204  (          ...     \u00b5),  where  the  political  sense  may  also  be  present. For  the  Archaic  period  we  have  Tyrtaios  fr. 4.4,  West,  with connotations  of  state  and  perhaps  country;  frr. 8  and 10 seem  to  use  polis  in  the  political  sense.  Hdt. 7.234.2  combines the  urban  and  political  senses  of  polis  with  a  reference  to Lakedaimon  the  district,  and  includes  the  polis  of  Sparte within  Lakedaimon  (      \u00b5  ).  Ps.-Skylax  46  implicitly  includes  Sparte  among  the inland  poleis  of  Lakedaimon.  Couplings  of in  the urban  sense  with  occur  at  Xen.  Hell. 6.5.28:             and 7.5.11:     .Whereas the urban sense of polis  is  somewhat  rare,  the  political  sense  occurs  somewhat more  frequently  (e.g.  Xen.  Lac. 1.1,  cf. 10.4).  Phrases  combin- ing and occur  more  often  (Thuc. 1.132.1; Anaximenes,  Ars  rhetorica 24.3;  Isoc.  Hel. 63,  Panath. 41,  65; Arist.  Pol. 1271b11).  There  seem  to  be  no  examples  of  Sparta or  the  Spartiatai  being  described  as  a  polis  in  the  rarer  terri- torial  sense,  unless  Tyrt.  fr. 4  (supra)  or  Thuc. 5.63.4 (       ) are examples. ( 2)  Lakedaimon:  Lakedaimon  is  never  explicitly  called  a polis  in  the  urban  sense,  though  \u00b5 on  its  own often  clearly  denotes  the  city  (e.g.  the  Corinthians  deliver  a  speech   \u00b5  (Thuc. 1.43.1))  and  \u00b5  in  the  urban  sense  is  found  at  Thuc. 1.10.2;  note  also  that  at  Aen.  Tact. 2.2  the  ethnic \u00b5  is  coupled  with  \u00b5  (cf.  Flensted- Jensen  ( 1995)  129).  However,  at  Pl.  Leg. 683D  polis  is  used about  Lakedaimon  primarily  in  the  urban  sense  (  ,  ,  ,  \u00b5;  cf. Hansen  ( 2000)  178),  but  the  political  sense  is  a  connotation, and  the  reference  is  to  the  mythical  period.  Lakedaimon  is also  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  (Xen.  Hell. 5.2.32;  cf. 5.3.25,  4.23;  Lac. 9.4;  Pl.  Resp. 599D;  Isoc.  Paneg. 64).  The phrase  \"polis  of  the  Lakedaimonians\"  in  the  political  sense also  occurs  at  Thuc. 5.23.2,  where  the  text  of  a  treaty  couples \"the  Lakedaimonians  and  Athenians\"  as   ;  cf. 8.2.3; Xen.  Hell. 2.1.14,  3.5.6;  Arist.  Eth.  Nic. 1180a25;  CID ii  4.ii.48, 360).Sometimes,when  \u00b5  is  not  called  a  polis,  the name  possibly  refers  to the  wider  polis  embracing  Spartiatai and  perioikoi  (Thuc. 5.28.2).Apparently, \u00b5  is  not described  as  a  polis  in  the  territorial  sense.  For \u00b5,  Thuc. 8.40.2  provides  a  probable  example (there  are  more  slaves  in  Chios  than  in  any  polis  except  that  of the  Lakedaimonians).  Lakedaimon  is  also  called  an  in the  sense  of  an  ethnic  territory  containing  poleis  (Ps.-Skylax 46: \u00b5   ...       ,  including Sparta  itself).  For  the  perioikic  poleis  see  Hdt. 7.234.2: \u00b5  ...    (perioikoi  and  Spartans together);  Isoc.  Areop. 7: \u00b5  ...     ;Ps.-Skylax46:      \u00b5. Without  being  explicitly  coupled  with  Sparte  or Lakedaimon  the  urban  sense  of  polis  occurs  at  Hdt. 6.58.1, Thuc. 1.134.1;Xen.  Hell. 3.3.10\u00ad11;Isoc.  5.48;  the  political sense  occurs  at  Xen.  Hell. 1.6.5,  3.3.4,  4.2.9. The  term  is  applied  to  Spartans  (Hdt. 6.85.2, 9.35.1)  and  Lakedaimonians  (Xen.  Hell. 5.4.13,  7.4.20,  21; Aeschin. 1.180).  Without  being  explicitly  coupled  with Spartiates  or  Lakedaimonians,  politai  occurs  at  Xen.  Hell. 5.4.28,  23,  6.4.26. There  are  many  references  to the  of  the Lakedaimonian  or  Spartan  state.  Sometimes  it  is  that  of  the 588 shipley Spartiatai  (Isoc.  Panath. 109),  much more  often  that  of  the Lakedaimonioi  (Thuc. 1.18.1;Xen.  Hell. 2.3.34;  Arist.  Pol. 1269a29). \u00b5   was  the  title  of  works by Xenophon  (Lac.),  Kritias  (DK  no. 88  frr. 6\u00ad9,  32\u00ad37),  and Aristotle  (frr. 539\u00ad51).  Occasionally  is  linked  with \u00b5  (Pl.  Leg. 712D).  We  also  find   (Arist.  Pol. 1272b33)  and  (Ephor.  fr. 118  apud  Strabo  8.5.5). The  verb  \u00b5  is  used  in  laudatory  accounts  of the  Lakedaimonian  constitution  (Isoc. 3.24;Dem.  20.105). The  terms     (Xen.  Hell. 4.4.19)  and   (Xen.  Hell. 7.1.28)  are  used  to  distinguish Lakedaimonian  (including  perioikic)  forces  from  those  of the  allies.  Polyb. 6.45.3  refers  to   , \"the land  divided  among  the  citizens\"  (see  Hodkinson  ( 1986)  385). Sparte  is  called  an  asty  in  Thgn. 785  Anon.  Megarensis (c. 480,Hdt.7.220.4;  and  Simon.  fr. 11.29,West\u00b2; occurs at  Hdt. 6.57.2,  61.2  (cf.  Hansen  ( 1997)  10\u00ad11). Sparta  is  called  patris  in  IG xii.9286  (Eretria,  C 6)  and Xen.  Lac. 1.2  and  [ ] [  ] in  Simon.  fr. 11.32, West \u00b2.  Lakedaimon  is  called  \"the  akropolis  of  Greece\"  and patris  in  Lysander's  monument  commemorating  the  battle of  Aigos  potamoi  (ML  95c;  SEG 33  439;  F.Delphes iii.150).Cf. Xen.  Hell. 7.1.30  (patris)  and  Hdt. 9.76.1  (patre). The  different  uses  of  the  two  city-ethnics  are  found  as  follows. ( 1)  Spartiates:  internally,  Spartiates  is  not  attested  in  the Archaic  or  Classical  periods.  The  external  individual  use  is found  in  LSAG \u00b2446  no. 16a  (c. 550)  and  IvO 263  (C 6)  (Dunst ( 1972)  140\u00ad44);  and  in  Hdt. 7.226.1,  8.42.2;  Thuc. 2.66.2, 4.11.2;Xen.  Hell. 5.4.39,  7.1.25;  An. 4.8.25.  The  external  collec- tive  use  is  found  in  IvO 244  (  LSAG 199  no. 10  (C 6f?));  and in  Hdt. 1.65.4,  67.1;  Thuc. 1.28.3,  132.1;Xen.  Hell. 3.3.5,  4.3.23, 6.5.21. ( 2)  Lakedaimonios  is  much  more  common  than Spartiates.  The  internal  collective  use  occurs  in  the  list  of contributions  to  the  \"Spartan\"  war  fund  (IG v.11;ML  67, with  SEG 39  370  , 44  342;  LSAG 201  no. 55  and  Matthaiou and  Pikoulas  ( 1989);  Loomis  ( 1992)  (C 5l/C4e))  and  the treaty  with  the  Aitoloi/Erxadieis  (ML 67  bis  (c. 426?);cf.IG  v.1 219.2  (C 5)).The  external  individual  use  (on  which  see  supra) is  found  in  C 6  in  SEG 11  1180a  (C 6f)  and 29  408  (LSAG 199 no. 20;  Olympia  (c.C 6s));  in  C 5  in  SEG 28  724  (Eretria,  C 5l) and  IG xi.2  161.B.59  (Delos),  votive by  \u00b5  (Lysander  was  a  mothax,see supra 570); and  in  C 4  in  Tod  135  ( 367);  IG xii.5542.18  (C 4m).  The  exter- nal  collective  use  is  found  in  ML  22  (c. 490\u00ad80);  IvO 247 (C 5e);  IG i\u00b3  522,  425;  F.Delphes iii.4462.A.3  ( 375/4);  CID ii 4.ii.48  ( 360);  Hdt. 1.6.3;  Thuc. 5.77.1  (certainly  equivalent  to Spartiatai  here);  Xen.  Hell. 1.2.18.  Coupled  with  the  wider ethnic  \"Dorian\"  it  occurs  in  CID ii  32.43:   []\u00b5  (C 4l).  For  the  use  of  the  vari- ant  ethnic  Lakon,see SEG 31  559  (Delphi, 369\u00ad368),  weapons captured  from  ;  the  external  individual  use  is found  in  Xen.  An. 2.1.5,  5.31. The  territory,  when  referred  to as  ge  or  chora  in  prose,  is always  that  of  the  Lakedaimonians  (Thuc. 8.58.3;Xen.  Hell. 6.5.24;  Ps.-Skylax 46;  F.Delphes iii.16,  369),  never  of  the Spartans.  Between  C 6s  and  371  Sparta  controlled  two-fifths of  the  Peloponnese  (Thuc. 1.10.2),  an  area  of  c. 8,500  km \u00b2 (Cartledge  ( 1979)  7).  (For  Lakedaimon  the  region,  and  for Lakonike,  see  Introduction). The  Eurotas  valley,  with  or  without  the  hills  of  Vardounia and  the  coastal  plain  of  Helos  including  Gytheion  (no. 333) to  its  west,  has  sometimes  been  considered  the  Spartan  \"core territory\".  Even  if  such  an  entity  was  not  juridically  defined or  precisely  bounded  (which  it  may  have  been),  it  seems likely  that  Sparta  had  a  contiguous  territory  which  was ringed  by  those  of  perioikic  poleis.  In  the  Classical  period  it would  have  been  bounded  on  the  north  by  those  of  Pellana (no. 341)  (Plut.  Agis 8.1)  and  Sellasia  (no. 343),  on  the  east  by that  of  Geronthrai  (no. 332),  to  the  south  perhaps  by  that  of Gytheion,  and  on  the  west  by  the  crest  of  Ta\u00ffgetos  and/or the  area  known  as  Dentheliatis.  The  Archaic  and  Classical territory  of  Sparta  proper  amounted  to c. 270  km \u00b2,  of  which almost  half  was  prime  arable  land  (Catling  ( 2002)).  There are  no  ancient  references  to  the  so-called  Spartiatike  ge,  a  fig- ment  of  modern  scholarship.  Instead,  post-Classical authors  refer  to  \"the  land  belonging  to  the  asty\"(Plut.  Lyc. 8.5)  or  \"the  civic  land\"  (    :  Polyb. 6.45.3;see MacDowell  ( 1986)  91\u00ad92;  Hodkinson  ( 1986)  385). Notoriously,  the  Spartan  land  economy  was  based  on extraction.  The  Spartans  expropriated  a  large  part  of  the agricultural  produce  of  helot  cultivators,  mostly  in Messenia  but  also  in  Laconia  (Tyrt.  frr. 6\u00ad7  apud  Paus. 4.14.5; Myron  (FGrHist 106)  fr. 2  apud  Ath. 657d;  Plut.  Lyc. 24.2; Mor. 239D\u00adE).  Their  farms  were  allegedly  assigned  as  kleroi (plots)  to  individual  Spartiates  from  which  to  draw  their contributions  to  the  communal  messes  (syssitia).  Lykourgos was  believed  to  have  allocated  9,000  kleroi  to  the  Spartiates and 30,000  to  the  perioikoi  (Plut.  Lyc. 8.5).  The  Spartans  supposedly  held  equal  kleroi  from  the  state  (possibly  called \"the  ancient  portion\",  Heracl.  Lemb. 12;or  \"the  anciently  dis- tributed  portion\",  Plut.  Mor. 238E);  but  Hodkinson  ( 2000) argues  that  it  is  the  helots'  tribute,  and  doubts  that  the  kleros system  existed. lakedaimon  589 Spartiate  numbers  probably  peaked  in  C 5e;they  may  have increased  after  new  farmland  was  opened  up  in  C 6m (Catling  ( 2002)  210\u00ad11).Referring  to 480,Hdt.  7.234.2  makes Damaratos  say  that  the  polis  of  Sparta  contains  approxi- mately  8,000  men--possibly the only r emotely  reliable  esti- mate  of  total  Spartiate  numbers.At  Plataiai  in  479  there  were 5,000  Spartans  (Hdt. 9.28.2),perhaps  formally  two-thirds  of the  total  levy  (Cartledge  ( 1979)  207\u00ad8).Arist.  Pol. 1270a36\u00ad38 reports  that  there  were  \"once\" 10,000  Spartiatai.  According to Diod. 11.63.1\u00ad2,  the  earthquake  of  c. 465  and  subsequent shocks  killed  more  than  20,000  Lakedaimonians,  but  this  is no  basis  for  reliable  statistics  (Cartledge  ( 1979)  218,  222).  In 480,  the  total  population  in  citizen  families  may  have  been c. 35,000\u00ad40,000  (Cartledge  ( 1979)  222).  At  Nemea  in  394, there  were some  6,000  Lakedaimonian  hoplites  (Xen.  Hell. 4.2.16).  At  Leuktra  in  371,  there  were  only  700  Spartiates (Xen.  Hell. 6.4.15),  plus  half  as  many  left  at  home  ( 6.4.17), suggesting  a  total  Spartiate  class  of  c. 1,050.  On  the  causes  of the  decline  in  Spartiate  numbers,  commonly  called  \"oligan- thropy\",  see  Hodkinson  ( 1986),  ( 2000)  406\u00ad23. The  Lakedaimonians  were  the  leaders  of  the  Hellenic League  which  defeated  the  Persian  invasion  of 480\u00ad479 (Thuc. 1.18.2;ML  27  coil 2;  Brunt  ( 1953)).  They  were  likewise the  leaders  of  the  \"Peloponnesian  League\"  (a  modern name),  referred  to  in  our  sources  as  \"the  Lakedaimonians and  the  allies\"  (Thuc. 1.108.1)  or  \"the  Peloponnesians\" (Thuc. 1.1.1).This  system  of  alliances,  often  one-sided,  prob- ably  came  into  being  during  C 6  and  functioned  until  the League  was  dissolved  after  the  Spartans'  defeat  at  Leuktra ( 371),which  caused  the  loss  of  most  of  Messenia  and  some  of the  perioikoi.  (These  alliances  did  not  involve  the  perioikoi; as  members  of  the  Lakedaimonian  polis,  they  and  the Spartans  formed  a  single  party  in  treaties.)  In  506  the Corinthians  (no. 227)  showed  that  allies  could  restrain Sparta,  causing  an  expedition  to  be  halted  (Hdt. 5.91\u00ad93). Soon  after,  c. 504,  decision-making  procedures  were  regu- larised  (Cartledge  ( 1979)  147\u00ad48).  On  the  League,  see Cartledge  ( 2002);  Salmon  ( 1984)  ch. 17;  Gschnitzer  ( 1978). There  are  many  references  to  the  Lakedaimonian\u00ad Peloponnesian  alliance  (e.g.  Thuc. 1.108.1)  and  to  other alliances  made  by  the  Lakedaimonians  (e.g.  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge ii nos. 112,  144,  etc.).  An  important  epigraphic  example  from Sparta,  dating  from  perhaps  460\u00ad380,  is  the  treaty  between the  Lakedaimonians  and  the  Aitolian  Erxadieis  (ML  67  bis  (p. 312);  SEG 26  461,  42  308  ;  LSAG \u00b2447g,  448),  which  contains the  key  phrase  h \u00b5]  h   [\u00b5] h (for  similar  formulations,  see  Hdt. 1.151.3;Xen. Hell. 2.2.20,  4.6.2,  5.3.26;  Lac. 15.2;Isoc.  12.180).  When  a  treaty or  alliance  involves  Sparta,  the  contracting  party  is  the \u00b5:  I.D\u00e9l. 6\u00ad787  fr.  a. 1  ( 402\u00ad399):  h    ~ \u00b5;  Thuc. 5.18.1:       \u00b5   \u00b5\u00b5. Exiles  are  attested  at  Thuc. 5.72.1;Xen.Hell.1.1.32,An.1.1.9; and  Theopomp.  fr. 240. The  Spartans,  with  the  Lakedaimonians,  enjoyed  the greatest  military  reputation  of  any  hoplite  army  from  the late  Archaic  period  until  their  catastrophic  defeat  by  the  Thebans  at  Boiotian  Leuktra  in  371.  On  the  Serpent Column  celebrating  victory  over  Xerxes,  the  Lake- daimonians  head  the  list  of  Greek  allies  (ML  27).As  in  other matters,  it  is  generally  as  Lakedaimonians,  not  Spartans,  that the  army  takes  the  field (Hdt. 6.72.1;  Thuc. 2.66.1,  5.33.1;Xen. An. 7.6.1;  cf.  IG i\u00b3  86.d\u00adg.14,  417;  IG ii\u00b2  107.43  ( 368/7)),  and indeed  the  shield  badge  was  often  a  for \u00b5 (Eupolis  fr. 359,  Kock;  Theopomp.  fr. 402;  cf.  Xen.  Hell. 4.4.10,  7.5.20;  see  further  Lazenby  ( 1985)  30);  booty  is  taken from  the  Lakedaimonians  (IvO 247;  LSAG 182  no. 4 (c.C 5m?);  Bauslaugh  ( 1990);  IG i\u00b3  522,  425;  F.Delphes iii.4 462.A.3  ( 375/4));  Leuktra  was  remembered  as  a  Lake- daimonian  defeat  (Parian  Chronicle  of 264/3:  IG xii.5  444; Tod 205.84).  It  is  possible  that  in  practice  each  of  the  five divisions,  lochoi,  of  the  hoplite  army  was  recruited  primari- ly  from  one  oba  of  the  polis  (infra),  without  there  being  any formal  link  (Singor  ( 1999)  74\u00ad75).  Chief  command  of  the land  army  was  normally  held  by  one  or  both  kings;  that  of the  navy  in  the  Classical  period  by  a  nauarchos  (Thuc. 2.66.2; Xen.  Hell. 1.5.1),  sometimes  with  an  epistoleus,  secretary (Hell. 2.1.7).Further  details  of  Spartan  military  organisation and  its  chronological  development  may  be  found  in Lazenby  ( 1985)  and  Sekunda  and  Hook  ( 1998). The  perioikoi  were  integral  to  the  army;  at  Plataiai  there were  10,000  Lakedaimonians,  of  whom  only  half  were Spartans  (Hdt. 9.28.2).  Until  the  late  Classical  period,  how- ever,  they  were  probably  brigaded  separately  from  Spartiates (Lazenby  ( 1985)  15\u00ad16).At  times  they  exercised  command  in the  navy  (Thuc. 8.22.1).  Helots  also  normally  served:  Hdt. 9.10.1  says  that  at  Plataiai  there  were  seven  helots  to  each Spartan  (no  doubt  an  exaggeration;  see  further  Hunt  ( 1998) 33\u00ad39). Spartans  of  military  age  were  required  to  reside  in  the  city (Xen.  Lac. 5;Plut.  Lyc. 15.3\u00ad4),  but  their  private  farms  were presumably  spread  all  over  the  core territory of  Lakedaimon and  probably  the  whole  of  Lakonike;  perhaps  their  families resided  there. Envoys  are  regularly  sent  to  and  from  Lakedaimon  or  the Lakedaimonians,  not  Sparta  or  the  Spartans  (though  see 590 shipley Hdt. 1.141.4,  6.85.1,  7.149.2,  etc.):  (a)  to  Lakedaimon:  Hdt. 9.7.1;  Thuc. 3.85.3,92.3;Xen.Hell.3.2.12;  cf.  IG ii\u00b2  1.45  ( 403/2); (b)  to  the  Lakedaimonians:  Ktesias  (FGrHist 688)  T  7,  cf.  fr. 30);  Dem. 20.73;  Arist.  Ath.  Pol. 32.3;  (c)  from  Lakedaimon: Thuc. 1.139.3;  IG ii\u00b2  106.7  ( 368/7);  (d)  from  the Lakedaimonians:  Hdt. 7.153.1;  Thuc. 1.28.1;Xen.  Hell. 5.4.22; Ktesias  (FGrHist 688)  T  7.  The  Lakedaimonians  acted  as arbitrators  between  Elis  (no. 251)  and  Lepreon  (no. 306)  in 421  (Thuc. 5.31.4). Proxenia,  too,  is  conducted  in  the  name  of  the Lakedaimonians.  For  proxenoi  of  the  Lakedaimonians  in other  poleis,  see  e.g.  Thuc. 3.52.5  (Plataiai  (no. 216));  5.43.2 (Athens  (no. 361));  5.59.5  (Argos  (no. 347));  Xen.  Hell. 5.4.22 (Athens); 6.1.3  (Pharsalos  (no. 413)).  For  Lakedaimonians  act- ing  as  proxenoi  of  other  poleis,see SEG 11  1180a  (LSAG 199  no. 15  (C 6f)  (Elis  (no. 251));  SEG 26  467  (C 6?)  (Elis);  IG xii.5542.18 (Karthaia  (no. 492)?  (C 4m));  Thuc. 5.76.3  (Argos).  According to  Hdt. 6.57.2,  it  was  a  royal  privilege  to  appoint  Spartans (astoi)  to act  as  proxenoi  of  foreign  states  (Cartledge  ( 1987) 108,  245\u00ad46);  however,  grants  of  proxeny  to Lakedaimonians by foreign poleis  are  attested,  e.g.  IG ii\u00b2  106.14  ( 368/7). Citizenship  grants  may  have  been  enacted  by  allowing  the sons  of  favoured  xenoi,  such  as  Xenophon  (Diog.  Laert. 2.54),  to  proceed  through  the  agoge  and  join  the Lakedaimonian  army  (cf.  the  \u00b5  of  Xen.  Hell. 5.3.9). Poor  Spartans  could  be  sponsored  through  the  upbringing (cf.  Introduction).  At  times  of  crisis  even  helots  might  be offered  citizenship  in  return  for  military  service  (Thuc. 4.80.3,  5.34.2;Xen.  Hell. 6.5.28\u00ad29);  some  were  selected  for elevation  to  the  citizen  body  as  \u00b5  (Thuc. 7.19.3, 8.5.1;Xen.  Hell. 3.1.4),  presumably  as  members  of  the Lakedaimonian  damos  rather  than  the  Spartan.  A  grant  of citizenship  is  attested  prior  to  the  Persian  War  by  Hdt. 9.35.1. In  later  political  theory  the  Spartan  constitution  was famously  \"balanced\",  containing  elements  of  monarchy,  oli- garchy  and  democracy  through  the  combination  of  king- ship,  council  and  popular  assembly.  To  these  were  added  five ephors  elected  annually  by  shouting.  This  constitution-- the  renowned  eunomia--and the social organisation that went  with  it  were  attributed  to  Lykourgos,  who,  if  he  was  not wholly  legendary,  may  have  enacted  reforms  in  C 7e  (Forrest ( 1980)  55\u00ad58).  (On  Archaic  developments  see  Hodkinson ( 1997).)  The  Great  Rhetra,  of  which  a  seemingly  genuine (C 7e?)  text  in  early  Doric  has  come  down  to  us  (Plut.  Lyc. 6), established  (or  recognised)  the  phylai  and  obai  (tribes  and villages),  the  gerousia,  or  council  of  elders  (twenty-eight plus  the  two  kings),  and  an  apella  or  assembly  of  Spartan  cit- izens.  The  phylai  (civic  tribes)  may  have  been  the  standard Dorian  ones:  Pamphyloi,  Hylleis,  and  Dymanes  (Tyrt.  fr. 19, West;  Jones,  POAG 118).  The  peculiar  social  practices  of Classical  Sparta,  however,  were  perhaps  partly  \"reinstitu- tionalizations\"  (Finley  ( 1981))  of  traditional  customs,  given new  meaning  c.C 6m  in  order  to  strengthen  Sparta's  military security. The  C 4  Athenian  orator  Lykourgos  was  able  to produce  a text  of  a  Spartan  law  (Leoc. 129),  so  at  least  some  laws  were written  down.  New  laws  probably  required  the  initial  back- ing  of  an  ephor,  after  which  they  were  discussed  by  the  ger- ousia  and  only  then  by  the  assembly  (MacDowell  ( 1986) 6\u00ad7).  In  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  the  Spartans inscribed  few  public  documents,  but  important  examples include  the  list  of  war  contributions  and  the  treaty  with  the Erxadieis,  both  cited  above.  A  stele  recording  a  treaty  with Athens  is  to  be  put  up  at  the  Amyklaion  (rather  than  Sparta), according  to Thuc. 5.18.10  (cf. 5.23.6).  Possibly  the  earliest preserved  decree  of  the  Lakedaimonians  is  a  C 3  resolution  in Doric  dialect  granting  asylia  to  Kos  (SEG 12  371  (Kos, 242)), beginning  \u00b5 \u00b5.  It  avoids,  perhaps deliberately,  the  wordy  formulas  of  normal  Hellenistic decrees.  Cf.  Thuc. 5.77. Spartan  civic  order  was  famously  stable  (Thuc. 1.18.1),but the  accounts  of  the  foundation  of  its  colony  at  Taras  (no. 71) in  C 8l  include  references  to instability  and  stasis  (Antiochos (FGrHist 555)  fr. 13;  Arist.  Pol. 1306b31). On  trial  procedures  and  punishments,  see  MacDowell ( 1986)  135\u00ad50.  Hdt. 6.57.4\u00ad5  states  that  the  kings  adjudicated cases  concerning  heiresses  (cf.  Hodkinson  ( 2000)  94\u00ad95), adoption  and  public  roads.  Arist.  Pol. 1285a6\u00ad7  adds  reli- gious  matters.  Beyond  that,  the  extent  of  kings'  functions  is debatable  (MacDowell  ( 1986)  123\u00ad26;see supra  on  prox- enoi).  The  gerousia  was  the  ultimate  capital  court  for Spartiatai  (Xen.  Lac. 10.2;  cf.  Arist.  Pol. 1294b33\u00ad34,  1275b10). Ephors  could  perhaps  impose  the  death  penalty  on  perioikoi (Isoc. 12.181),  no  doubt  after  due  process.  They  probably  did so  upon  the  rebel  Kinadon,  apparently  an  inferior  (Xen. Hell. 3.3.11).  Probably  the  assembly  did  not  try  cases  except those  involving  disputed  royal  succession,  and  then  not automatically  (MacDowell  ( 1986)  133\u00ad35).  A  death  sentence against  a  king  is  attested  by  Xen.  Hell. 3.5.25  (on  trials  of kings,  see  de  Ste  Croix  ( 1972)  350\u00ad53). The  eponymous  official was the e phoros  (IG v.1213.66, 73\u00ad74,  81,  90  (C 5s  or  C 4e),  1228;  Thuc. 2.2.1),  who  acted  as chairman  (Sherk  ( 1990)  241\u00ad43)  of  the  board  of  five (Arist. Pol. 1272a6).  According  to  tradition,  the  high  office of ephoros  was  instituted  by  Lykourgos  (Hdt. 1.65.6)  or  by  King Theopompos  (Arist.  Pol. 1313a26ff).  Ephors  are  attested  in lakedaimon  591 manumission  stelai  from  Tainaron,  e.g.  IG v.1  1228\u00ad33 (C 5l\u00adC4e).  The  ephors  were  elected  annually    \u00b5 (Arist.  Pol. 1270b7\u00ad8;  see  Rahe  ( 1980);  Rhodes ( 1981)).  The  ephors'  official r esidence  was  the  ephoreion (Xen.  Ages. 1.36). The  council  was  called  (Dem. 20.107;  Arist.  Pol. 1270b24,  1272b37;Ar.  Lys. 980  has ;Xen.  Lac. 10.3 calls  it  ).  It  was  composed  of  thirty  members  who held  tenure  for  life  and  acted  as  the  probouleumatic  body: the  two  kings  were  members  ex  officio,  and  the  remaining twenty-eight  members  were chosen  by the  assembly  from among  citizens  above  the  age  of 60  (Pl.  Leg. 691D\u00ad692A; Plut.  Lyc. 26;  Michell  ( 1952)  135\u00ad40). The  post  of  kytherodikes,  magistrate  in  charge  of  Kythera (no. 336),  was  probably  a  special  institution;  there  is  no  evi- dence  that  Sparta  appointed  harmostai  as  governors  of  peri- oikic  poleis  in  the  normal  course  of  events  (Cartledge  ( 1979) 179;MacDowell ( 1986)  28\u00ad30).  The  existence  of  lesser  mag- istrates  seems  certain  from  Xen.  Lac. 8.3. The  existence  of  an  assembly  is  attested  already  in  the Great  Rhetra  (Plut.  Lyc. 6.2).  Meetings  of  the  assembly  are attested  in  Thuc. 6.88.18  (cf. 1.67.3,  87.1)  and  Xen.  Hell. 2.2.19, 3.2.23,  5.2.11,etc.(Andrewes ( 1966)  6).  The  assembly  was presided  over  by the  ephorate  (Thuc. 1.87.1\u00ad2;  Andrewes ( 1966)  13\u00ad14).  In Thuc. 5.77.1,  a  treaty  with  Argos  voted  by the  assembly,  the  name  is    \u00b5 (cf.  Thuc. 1.87.2;  5.34.1;  Aeschin. 1.180).  Its  early  epichoric name  was  possibly  apella  (Plut.  Lyc. 6.2),but  see  de  Ste  Croix ( 1972)  346\u00ad7.  In  Xen.  Hell. 3.3.8  is  a  unique  reference  to \u00b5 \u00b5   . The  city  of  Sparta  is  48  km  from  the  sea,  further  than  most major  poleis.  Its  location  is  modern  Sparti.  The  low  acropo- lis  (now  Palaiokastro),  \"standing  out  to  no  conspicuous height\"  (Paus. 3.17.1),  overlooks  the  northern  end  of  the town.  The  layout  of  the  town  is  increasingly  well  understood (Cartledge  ( 1979)  102\u00ad29;  Raftopoulou  ( 1998);  Kourinou ( 2000)).  In  Classical  and  even  Hellenistic  times  the  city  had no  regular  street  plan  (Raftopoulou  ( 1998)  127).  It  was,  as Thucydides  famously  remarked  ( 1.10.2),  an  unimpressive urban  entity,  discontinuously  settled  (  \u00b5;  cf. Hansen  ( 1997)  34\u00ad35),  but  apparently  somewhat  densely built  up  in  the  360s  (Aen.  Tact. 2.2).  Only  the  completion  of the  city  wall  paved  the  way  for  the  infilling of  the  asty  (prob- ably  from  C 3l  on:  Kourinou  ( 2000)  59\u00ad60,277).Sparta  com- prised  four  neighbouring  villages:  Pitana  in  the  northern and  north-western  part  of  the  city,  Limnai  to  the  east,  Mesoa in  the  south  and  south-west,  and  Kynosoura  (Konooura, Konosoura)  in  the  south-east  (Kourinou  ( 2000)  89\u00ad95, 279\u00ad80).  (Xenophon  mentions  rich houses  on  the  east  bank of  the  Eurotas,  Hell. 6.5.27;  cf. 7.5.11.)  A  fifth v illage,  Amyklai, lay  c. 6  km  south  at  modern  Amykles  and  included  the  sanc- tuary  of  Apollo  Hyakinthios.  These  probably  corresponded to  the  five Classical obai  (civic  subdivisions)  of  the  polis  (on which  see  Wade-Gery  ( 1958)  and  Lazenby  ( 1985)  51\u00ad52).  The main  roads  and  gates  have  been  traced  in  part  (Kourinou ( 2000)  67\u00ad75,  131\u00ad54,  277\u00ad78),  as  have  the  bridges  across  the Eurotas  and  its  tributaries  (Armstrong,  Cavanagh  and Shipley  ( 1992);  superseded  by  Kourinou  ( 2000)  77\u00ad88, 278\u00ad79).  The  agora  (Xen.  Hell. 3.3.5;  Paus. 3.11.2\u00ad11),  once thought  to  lie  east  or  south-east  of  the  acropolis  (Cartledge and  Spawforth  ( 1989)  128),  has  now  been  placed  on  its  sum- mit  (Kourinou  ( 2000)  99\u00ad129,  280,  esp. 108).  The  C 5  Persian stoa  (Paus. 3.11.3)  built  to  celebrate  the  victory  over  Xerxes may  have lain  on  the  north-western  side  of  the  agora (Kourinou  ( 2000)  109\u00ad14,  281).  The  famous  C 6m  Skias  was designed  by  Theodoros  of  Samos  (Paus. 3.12.10).  The  exca- vated  \"Round  Building\",  sometimes  thought  to  be  the  Skias, is  now  tentatively  dated  C 3/C2  and  identified as the Choros (Paus. 3.11.9),  successor  to  an  earlier  structure  or  space where  the  Gymnopaidiai  took  place  (Kourinou  ( 2000) 114\u00ad27,  281).  Palaistrai  are  referred  to at  Pl.  Tht. 162B. The  Archaic  and  Classical  town  of  Sparta  was  without  a city  wall  (Xen.  Hell. 6.5.28),  a  fact  which  contributed  to Spartans'  military  reputation  (Lys. 33.7).  They  apparently built  a  rudimentary  one  in  317  under  the  threat  of  invasion from  Cassander  (Just.  Epit. 14.5.5,  7),  though  this  is  not archaeologically  confirmed.  The  C 3e  ditches  and  palisades (Paus. 1.13.6;Plut.  Pyrrh. 27.5;  Polyb. 5.19.4)  were  expanded into  walls  with  a  circuit  of 48  stades  (Polyb. 9.26a.2),  enclos- ing  c. 209  ha  (Cartledge  and  Spawforth  ( 1989)  133).  (For details  of  the  walls,  see  Kourinou  ( 2000)  35\u00ad66.) Burials  took  place  at  the  margin  of  each  of  the  four  main obai  and  thus  within  the  \"urban\"  area,  continuing  for  several generations  after  the  single  city  wall  was  built  in  C 3.  The  ear- liest  burials  are  thus  evidence  for  the  boundaries  of  the  obai (Kourinou  ( 2000)  215\u00ad19,  283\u00ad84).  One  C 6e\u00adC5m  cemetery contained  two-storey  tombs  (Raftopoulou  ( 1998)  134\u00ad35). There  is  little  evidence  for  the  Classical  management  of water-supply  and  drainage  before  C 3,  only  some  C 4  drains in  different  obai  (Kourinou  ( 2000)  229\u00ad33,  284\u00ad85). The  Rhetra  of  Epitadeus,  alleged  by  Plut.  Agis 5.2\u00ad4  (cf. Arist.  Pol. 1270a15\u00ad34)  to be  a  C 5  decree  allowing  land  to be disposed  by  will,  is  probably  fictitious (Hodkinson ( 1986) 389\u00ad91,(2000)  90\u00ad94).  Spartans  could  certainly  acquire  and dispose  of  private  land;  on  the  mechanisms  of  inheritance, notably  the  effects  of  partible  transmission,  see  MacDowell 592 shipley ( 1986)  89\u00ad110;  Hodkinson  ( 1986),  ( 2000).  Sparta  differed from  many  poleis  in  permitting  women  to  own  and bequeath  land;  Arist.  Pol. 1270a15\u00ad34  estimates  that  in  his  day two-fifths of  the  land  belonged  to  them.  (On  other  aspects of  women's  life  in  Sparta,  see  Cartledge  ( 1981);  Schaps ( 1979);  MacDowell  ( 1986)  71\u00ad88.)  Some  land  in  perioikic communities  was  assigned  to  the  kings  (Xen.  Lac. 15.3).Land in  Lakonike  was  sometimes  granted  to  homeless  groups  of outsiders:  at  Methone  (no. 319)  to  Nauplians  (Paus. 4.24.4, 27.8),  at  Messenian  Asine  (no. 313)  to  the  Argive  Asinaians (Paus. 4.8.3,  14.3,  27.8,  34.9),  and  at  Thyrea  (no. 346)  to  the Aiginetans  (Thuc. 2.27.2,  4.57.1,  3).We  do  not  know  whether in  such  a  case  the  perioikic  community  in  question  was  con- sulted,  but  it  is  possible. Spartan  citizens  made  regular  contributions  in  kind  to the  common  messes  (syssitia)  (Arist.  Pol. 1271a26\u00ad37, 1272a13\u00ad15;  Hodkinson  ( 2000)  190\u00ad99),  and  probably  paid the  cost  of  their  sons'  education  (Ducat  ( 1999)  48).A  system of  eisphora  is  mentioned  (and  criticised)  by  Arist.  Pol. 1271b11\u00ad15  (Hodkinson  ( 2000)  189\u00ad90).  It  is  disputed whether  the  perioikoi  paid  taxes;  the  account  of  Ephor.  fr. 117 (apud  Strabo  8.5.4)  is  not  creditworthy  (but  see  Hodkinson ( 2000)  188,190).Helots,of  course,  paid  a  fixed proportion of their  agricultural  produce,  or  a  fixed amount,  to  the  Spartan state.  On  the  realities  of  wealth  and  property  in  Classical Sparta,  which  recent  research  suggests  was  closer  to  \"nor- mal\"  Greek  societies  than  previously  thought,  Hodkinson ( 2000)  supersedes  previous  studies. Despite  the  notorious  secrecy  of  Sparta  (Thuc. 5.68.2) and  periodic  expulsions  of  aliens  (Ar.  Av. 1012\u00ad13;  Thuc. 1.144.2,  2.39.1),  foreigners  did  reside  there:  Xen.  Mem. 1.2.6 refers  to xenoi  \"visiting  Lakedaimon\"  ( \u00b5    \u00b5;  cf.  Hodkinson  ( 2000)  337  with  n. 6). The  Lakedaimonians  were proverbially  pious  (on  cults see  Wide  ( 1893);  Ziehen  ( 1929);  Parker  ( 1989)).  The Dioskouroi  were  among  the  most  popular  heroes.  At  Sparta, cult  worship  was  also  paid  to  Leukippides,  Lykourgos, Agamemnon,  Orestes,  Talthybios  and  the  ephor  Chilon.  The major  festivals  were  devoted  to  Apollo:  the  Karneia  (Hdt. 7.206.1,  8.72);  Gymnopaidia(i)  (Thuc. 5.82.2,  3;Xen.  Hell. 6.4.16);  and  Hyakinthia  (Hdt. 9.11.1).Important  Archaic  and Classical  cult  places  include  the  temple  of  Athena Chalkioikos,  built  on  the  acropolis  by  Gitiadas  (Paus. 3.17.2; Dickins  ( 1906\u00ad7);  on  Gitiadas,  see  Romano  ( 1980)  129\u00ad32:he may  have been  active C 6m).  That  of  Athena  Poliachos  was the  premier  intra-urban  cult  site,  shared  by  all  five obai (Cartledge  ( 1979)  55,  106).  At  the  edge  of  the  city,  beside  the river  Eurotas,  was  the  sanctuary  of  Artemis  Orthia  (first temple  c. 700,  second  c. 575\u00ad560;  Dawkins  ( 1929);  Boardman ( 1963)).  Other  sanctuaries  identified from archaeological evidence  include  those  of  Athena  Alea  (Xen.  Hell. 6.5.27), Artemis  Agrotera  (converted  to  or  combined  with  Artemis Kyparissia  c.C 3),  Poseidon  Tainarios  and  the  Phoibaion (Hdt. 6.61.3;  on  these  see  Kourinou  ( 2000)  155\u00ad213).  There was  another  important  cult  of  Apollo  at  Thornax  just  north  of  the  city  (Paus. 3.10.8;  probably  LS  site  h45, Geladari). On  a  ridge  overlooking  the  south-eastern  part  of  the  city across  the  Eurotas  stands  the  Menelaion,  or  sanctuary  of Menelaos  and  Helen,  established  c. 700  near  the  site  of  a  late Bronze  Age  mansion;  the  third  Menelaion  dates  from  C 5e (Cartledge  ( 1979)  120\u00ad21,  155).  At  Amyklai,  Bathykles  of Magnesia  built  the  temple  of  Apollo  known  as  the Amyklaion,  where  important  public  documents  were lodged  (Thuc. 5.18.11;  Paus. 3.18.9;  Tomlinson  ( 1992)).  Its colossal  Archaic  statue  of  Apollo,  some  15  m  high,  was  a  key monument  in  Laconia  (Parker  ( 1989)  146).Amyklai  was  one of  a  ring  of  sacred  sites  protecting  the  city  at  a  few  kilome- tres'  distance,  such  as  Zeus  Messapeus  on  the  Tsakona  ridge (Catling  and  Shipley  ( 1989);  Catling  ( 1990)),  another  cult site  of  Messapian  Zeus  at  Messapeai  in  the  plain  to  the  south, a  hill-top  sanctuary  of  unknown  identity  to  the  east  at Phagia  (LS  site  u3002),  and  the  Eleusinion  at  Kalyvia  Sochas to  the  south.  Most  or  all  of  these  were  mutually  inter-visible. A  regular  calendar  of  festivals  involving  both  Spartans and  perioikoi  took  place  around  Laconia.  (Agonistic  culture within  Laconia  is  discussed  by  Hodkinson  ( 1999)  148\u00ad60.) The  \"Damonon  inscription\"  IG v.1213  (SEG 38  333  ;  LSAG \u00b2 201  no. 52,  addenda  p. 448  (post- 403))  records  the  victories of  Damonon,  and  his  son  at  several  of  them:  the  Pohoidaia for  Poseidon  (in  Sparta,  Thouria  and  Helos),  the  Athanaia (at  Sparta),  the  Eleuhinia  (at  Kalyvia  Sochas?),  the  Ariontiai (probably  at  Sparta),  the  Lithehia  (in  the  Malea  peninsula?), the  Parparonia  in  Thyreatis,  and  the  Maleateia  (probably  at the  sanctuary  of  Apollo  Maleatas  at  modern  Kosmas).  IG v.1 222  (SEG 30  402  ;  LSAG 199  no. 22  (c. 530\u00ad500?)),  a  votive to (Apollo)  Karneios,  commemorates  a  victor  at  the  Athanaia. The  calendar  appears  to  have  been  same  throughout Lakedaimon.  It  began  in  midsummer  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 140).  Months  attested  as  Lakedaimonian  (never  Spartan)  in Archaic  or  Classical  texts  are  \u00b5  (Thuc. 5.19.1;  also IG v.1.  11  (C 1)), (Thuc. 4.119.2)  and   (Thuc. 5.54.2;  cf.  Epidauros  Limera  (no. 329)  (Hellenistic)). The  Spartans  not  infrequently  consulted  the  Delphic  ora- cle,  for  example  in  C 8l  (Parke  and  Wormell  ( 1956)  i. 71\u00ad73;  ii. no. 46),  C 7e  (Hdt. 1.65.2\u00ad4;Xen.  Lac. 8.5;Plut.  Lyc. 6),  C 6e lakedaimon  593 (Hdt. 1.66.2,  67.4),  and  in  426  (Thuc. 3.92.5).  In  C 4, Lakedaimonians  served  the  Delphic  Amphiktyony  as naopoioi  (CID ii  31.35,  356;  31.75,  345)  and  hieromnamones (CID ii  32.43  (C 4l)). Numerous  Spartan  victors  at  international  games  are known,  particularly  from  Archaic  and  Classical  times (Olympionikai 17\u00ad18,  21\u00ad22,24,30,  32,34\u00ad35,  37,40\u00ad47,50,55, 57,  59,  60\u00ad68,  70,  72\u00ad73,  75\u00ad76,  78,  80,  82\u00ad86,  91,  108,  etc.;  for the  importance  of  Olympic  competition  to  Spartans,  see Hodkinson  ( 1999)  160\u00ad76,(2000)  307\u00ad11,  319\u00ad23);  two  peri- odonikai  are  on  record  (Paus. 6.1.7,  2.1;  Knab  ( 1934)  8).  In surviving  victory  dedications,  victors  use  the  ethnic \u00b5,  e.g.  SEG 11  1227  (c. 500)  (cf.  SEG 32  217.3\u00ad4 (r 628);  15  (r 384)).  In  420,  Spartans  were excluded  from  the Olympic  Games  by  the  Eleian  authorities  due  to  an  alleged breach  of  the  Olympic  Truce  (Thuc. 5.49.1\u00ad50.4,  on  which see  Roy  ( 1998);  cf.  Hodkinson  ( 2000)  329  n. 10). Communal  dedications  by  the  Spartiatai  are  rare:  see  IvO 244  (C 6f?).  Those  in  the  name  of  the  Lakedaimonians include  ML  22,  a  dedication  to  Zeus  Olympios;  cf.  Hdt. 1.51.4;  CID ii  4.ii.48  ( 360);  3.ii.28  ( 358);  24.i.15  ( 336)  (dona- tions  to  Delphi). Coinage,  like  luxuries  generally,  was  proverbially eschewed  by  the  late  Archaic  and  Classical  Spartans  (Xen. Lac. 7.2;Plut.Lyc.24.2),though  Xen.  Lac. 14.3  alleges  that  this law  is  no  longer  observed  (cf.  Hodkinson  ( 2000)  154\u00ad76). Only  under  Areus  I  ( 309/8\u00ad265)  and  intermittently  there- after  was  coinage  struck  (Grunauer-von  Hoerschelmann ( 1978)). It  is  often  asserted  that  Sparta  founded  only  one  overseas colony,  at  Taras  (no. 71),  founded  according  to  tradition  in 706  (Antiochos  of  Syracuse  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 13;see  Cartledge ( 1979)  123\u00ad24;  Malkin  ( 1994)  115\u00ad42).  Malkin  ( 1994),  howev- er,  has  shown  that  the  Spartans  were  active  colonizers,  both inside  and  outside  the  Peloponnese.  According  to  Strabo 8.4.4,  King  Teleklos  (c. 760\u00ad740)  established  colonies  at Poie\u00ebssa,  Echeiai  and  Tragion  in  south-eastern  Messenia some  time  before  the  main  conquest  of  Messenia.  Whether the  perioikic  towns  of  Messenia  were colonies  is  debatable; Malkin  ( 1994)  85  tentatively  advances  Thouria  (no. 322)  and Aithaia  (no. 312)  as  possible  C 8  foundations.  Both Geronthrai  (no. 332)  and  Pharis  (S 67)  are  said  to  have  been captured  from  their  Achaian  inhabitants  (Paus. 3.2.6). Geronthrai  was  resettled  by  the  \"Dorians  occupying Lakedaimon\"  ( 3.22.6),  but  Pharis  may  have gone  out  of  exis- tence  (cf. 3.20.3).  The  Spartans  settled  Minyans  in  six Triphylian  towns  (Hdt. 4.148.4),  of  which  Lepreon  (no. 306) was  resettled  in  421  (Thuc. 5.31.4,  34.1).  Sparta  colonized Herakleia  in  Trachis  (no. 430)  in  432  (Thuc. 3.92.1;  Malkin ( 1994)  219\u00ad35).  Links  with  Sparta  as  a  metropolis  were claimed  by  various  communities.  Thera  (no. 527)  was allegedly  an  apoikia  of  Lakedaimon  (Hdt. 4.147.1),  as  were Knidos  (no. 903)  (Hdt. 1.174.2;  Malkin  ( 1994)  80\u00ad81), Kythera  (no. 336)  (Thuc. 7.57.6;  Malkin  ( 1994)  81\u00ad82),  and Melos  (no. 505)  (Hdt. 8.48;  Thuc. 5.84.2,  etc.;  Malkin  ( 1994) 74\u00ad76).  Several  Cretan  cities  came  to  believe  the  same (Malkin  ( 1994)  8,  78\u00ad80). The  Spartans  and/or  Lakedaimonians  regarded  them- selves  as  an  immigrant  population,  having  arrived  as Dorians  (Thuc. 3.92.3)  or,  in  a  developed  version  of  the myth,  returned  (a  feature  of  Dorian  ideology  unique  to Sparta)  after  the  Trojan  War  together  with  the  descendants of  Herakles,  the  Herakleidai  (Hdt. 9.26.2,  4;  Malkin  ( 1994) 15\u00ad45,  esp. 43). 346.Thyrea  Map 58.  Lat. 37.25(?),  long. 22.40.  Size  of  ter- ritory: 1?  Type:  A.  (S 10).  The  toponym  is  ,  (Thuc. 4.56.2,  57.3),  which  is  also  a  name  for  the  surrounding  area (cf.  Hdt. 1.82.2;  Thuc. 4.57.3,  if  the  wording  implies  that  the place  captured  was  not  the  polis  town).  The  plural  form seems  to  be  used  only  of  the  district  (e.g.  Hdt. 1.82.2, who  uses  it  despite  having  just  given  the  singular  form  for the  district;  Isoc. 6.99).  A  city-ethnic  is  not  attested  in Classical  evidence. Although  Thyrea  is  never  quite  explicitly  called  a  polis, Thucydides  in  effect  twice  calls  it  a  polis  in  the  topographical sense  ( 4.57.1  with 4.57.3). Thuc. 2.27.2  and 4.56.2  says  that  the  Lakedaimonians  gave the  exiled  Aiginetans  one  of  their  own  frontier  possessions, Thyrea  in  Kynouria,  as  a  new  home.  At  2.27.2  the  expressions \"Thyrea  to  live  in  ( ) and the land to cultivate ...The land  (named)  Thyreatis  .  .  .\"  clearly  imply  that  Thyrea  was already  a  nucleated  settlement,  and  Thyreatis  its  territory. Later  he  tells  how  the  Athenians  attacked  the  Aiginetans  as they  were  building  a  fort  on  the  coast,  whereupon  they retreated  ...        ( 4.57.1).  Here, too,  it  is  a  reasonable  inference  that  the  inland  town  existed before  the  Aiginetans  started  building  the  coastal  fort.  When the  Athenians  \"capture  Thyrea  and  burn  the  polis\"( 4.57.3), this  equally  implies  that  the  town  was  called  Thyrea  like  the district,  otherwise  Thucydides  would  have  given  its  name. The  \"upper  polis\",  the  main  part  of  Thyrea,  has  been  vari- ously  located  (see  Shipley  ( 1997)  231,  and  cf.  Shipley  ( 1993)). The  MSS  of  Thuc.  place  it  c. 10  stades  (c. 1.8  km)  inland,  which might  suit  Kastraki  Kato  Meligous,  but  archaeological  confir- mation  is  lacking  (Phaklaris  ( 1990)  104\u00ad5,late  Hellenistic  and 594 shipley Roman  sherds;  Goester  ( 1993)  93  and 99,  Roman  architectur- al  fragments,  pottery  including  Classical  to  Hellenistic). Other  proposed  locations  are  LS  ii. 278,  aa13,  Elliniko (favoured  by  Phaklaris  ( 1990)  78\u00ad90,  Geometric  to  Roman; Goester  ( 1993)  55\u00ad81,  fortifications C 4s),  identified above  as  Eua  (no. 331);  277,  aa5,  Eva  Monis  Loukous  (Phaklaris ( 1990)  96\u00ad104,  mainly  Roman); 279,  aa16,  Marmaralona Xerokambiou  (Phaklaris  ( 1990)  111\u00ad17,  prehistoric, Geometric  to  Classical).  (See  also  Phaklaris  ( 1990)  18\u00ad20  on Thyreatis;  Pritchett  ( 1965\u00ad91)  vi. 94\u00ad101,  vii. 215\u00ad22.) The  Aiginetan  fort  next  to  the  sea  must  be  one  of  three promontories  in  the  bay  of  Astros.  It is  unlikely  to be  at Cherronisi  in  the  centre  of  the  bay,  which  is  a  small,  round- ed  hill  not  easy  to  fortify;  pottery  may  include  Classical  and probably  Hellenistic  pieces  (Goester  ( 1993)  88,  98,  though Phaklaris  ( 1990)  40\u00ad46  reports  nothing  later  than  C 6).  The fort  may  have  been  at  Nisi  Agiou  Andr\u00e9a  (LS  ii. 279,  aa19; Phaklaris  ( 1990)  51  fig. 12;  Goester  ( 1993)  84\u00ad88,  97\u00ad98), which  has  a  street  grid  and  a  Classical  circuit  wall  with  tow- ers.  This  could,  however,  be  a  late  Classical  to  Hellenistic successor  of  the  fort  on  the  same  site,  since  the  Aiginetans had  not  completed  their  work  when  the  Athenians  attacked and  may  have  had  no  opportunity  to  resume  it. Alternatively,  this  site  may  be  Anthana  (no. 324),  and  the  site of  the  Aiginetan  fort  might  be  Nisi  Paraliou  Astrous,  where there  is  a  Classical  circuit  wall  (Goester  ( 1993)  91\u00ad93,  undat- ed; 99).  Of  course,  no  trace  of  the  fort  may  survive  at  all. The  district  of  Thyrea  is  placed  in  Argolis  by  Hdt. 1.82.2 prior  to c. 545;at  6.76.2  it  is  a  coastal  place  within  reach  of Tiryns  and  Nauplion.  It  is  placed  on  the  borders  of  Argeia and  Lakonike  by Thuc. 4.56.2  (cf. 8);  in  Kynouria  by  Thuc. 5.41.2. Thuc. 2.27.3  suggests  that  Thyreatis  (or  Thyrea,  cf. 4.56.2) is  the  chora  of  a  polis.  Hdt.'s  ... ( 1.82.1)  and ( 1.82.2),  like  Thuc.'s  ( 2.27.2,  4.56.2,  5.41.2),    (supra)  and  ( 4.57.2),  will  be  different names  for  the  chora  of  the  polis  of  Thyrea,  which  existed before  the  Aiginetans  came  (though  there  may  have  been  a time  when  the  area  was  called  Thyrea  but  did  not  contain  a polis).  The  cult  of  Polemokrates  at  Eua  (Paus. 2.38.6;modern Eva)  and  that  of  Parparos  on  a  nearby  mountain (Marmaralona,  Xerokambi)  may  have  been  in  the  territory of  Thyrea. Though  there  is  implicit  evidence  that  the  polis  existed before  the  Lakedaimonians'  grant  to  the  Aiginetans,  there  is no  written  evidence  that  it  survived  later.  Thucydides'  juxta- position  of  \"Thyrea  and  the  polis  of  Anthana\"  (no. 324) ( 5.41.2)  could  imply  that  Thyrea  is  not  now  a  polis;  perhaps  it ceased  to  exist  in  424.  If,  however,  Thyrea  was  Nisi  Agiou Andrea,  it  had  a  long  post-C 4  life. lakedaimon  595", "Kyphanta": "Identifier: 336. , (Kyphantaseus) Map  58.  Lat. 37.00,long. 23.00.

(C 4m))  proves  that  it  was  a  polity  already  in  the  Classical period. Pausanias  implicitly  places  Kyphanta  in  Lakonike (named  at  e.g. 3.23.11).  Its  territory  perhaps  marched  with that  of  Prasiai  (no. 342),  since  Pausanias  gives  the  distance from  Prasiai  to  Kyphanta  ( 3.24.3):  Kyphanta  is  c. 100  stades (c. 18  km)  from  Zarax  and  c. 10  stades  (c. 1.8  km)  inland ( 3.24.2);  200  stades  ( 37  km)  from  Prasiai  by  sea  ( 3.24.3).  It was  probably  at  Kyparissi  (ancient  fort  with  polygonal masonry,  presumably  late  Classical  or  Hellenistic;  LS  ii. 282\u00ad83,  bb38).  It  was  ruined  in  Pausanias'  day  ( 3.24.2);  if correctly  identified,  the  archaeology  points  to  occupation into  Roman  times  (Wace  and  Hasluck  ( 1908\u00ad9)  173\u00ad74; Hood  ( 1956)  12). 336.

(At  8.27.4 (Teubner)  is  presumably  a  scribal  error.)  The  city- ethnic is  attested  (or  invented?)  by  Steph.  Byz. 161.13.  Paus. 3.21.3  locates  Belemina  100  stades  ( 18  km) beyond  Pellana.  The  settlement  was  probably  not  on  the  hill of  Chelmos  (LS  ii. 283,  cc41);  Pikoulas  ( 1988a)  122  regards Belminatis  chora  or  Belemina  as  the  area  around  Chelmos. Possible  sites  for  Classical  Belemina/Belbina,  if  there  was one,  are  Vardouka  Skortsinou  (C 4  to  Roman  finds) and three  less  precisely  dated  sites  near  Giakoumaiika  (Pikoulas ( 1988a)  120\u00ad21  nos. 75,  77).  Geometric  to  Archaic  finds in the area  (Pikoulas  ( 1988a)  119  no. 74,  i,  ii)  tend  to  push  the  exist- ence  of  this  possible  polis  back  before  300. Belbina  is  called  a  polis  in  the  topographical  sense  by  Ptol. Geog. 3.14.43  and  Steph.  Byz. 161.12,  in  the  (urban  and)  polit- ical  sense  only  by Paus. 8.27.4  (r 369),  in  his  list  of  poleis  from which  Megalopolis  (no. 282)  was  founded.  It  is  called  a  kome by  Phylarchos  and  Hsch. Belbina  is  explicitly  placed  in  Lakonike  by  Phylarchos  and by  Paus. 3.21.3.The  area  is  \u00b5   (Polyb. 2.54.3), ager  Belbinates  (Livy  38.34.8),or  \u00b5  (Strabo  8.3.12). As  the  territory of  a  polis,  if  it  existed  before  the  synoecism  of Megalopolis,  it  will  have  bordered  on  those  of  its  fellow Aigytian  towns  Leuktron  and  Malea  to  the  north-west  and of  the  Arkadian  towns  of  Oresthasion  (no. 287)  to  the  north and  Eutaia  (no. 270)  to  the  north\u00adnorth-east.  Athenaion,  a C 3l  fort  (Plut.  Cleom. 4.1  ( 25.1)),  may  have  been  an  import- ant  pre-C 3  cult  place. 327.Boia  (Boiates) Map  58.  Lat. 36.30,long.  23.04.  Size  of territory: 2?  Type:  A.  (S 2).  The  toponym  is  ,  (Ps.- Skylax 46); ,  (Strabo  8.5.2);  or  , (e.g.  Polyb. 5.19.8;  Paus. 1.27.5,  3.21.7,  3.22.11,  etc.;  second  century  ad grave-epigram,  Forrest  ( 1972)).  The  city-ethnic  is   (e.g.  Paus. 3.22.13;  restored  in  IG v.1932  (C 2m);  cf.  SEG 11 894).  The  polis  is  located  c. 200  stades  (c. 37  km)  from Epidauros  Limera  by  Paus. 3.23.6.It  lay  in  the  Malea  (Malias) peninsula,  at  or  immediately  north  of  Neapolis  Voion  (formerly  Vatika;  LS  ii. 312\u00ad13,  nn251;  Pikoulas  ( 1988b);  (S 2), followed  by  Barr.).  Epigraphic  finds (especially IG v.1952, late  Hellenistic)  confirm the presence of  a  polis  before Roman  times  even  if  they  do  not  preserve  its  name. Boia  is  first called a polis,  in  the  urban  sense,  by  Ps.-Skylax 46;  in  the  political  sense  in  IG v.1932  (if  correctly  restored (C 2m)).  According  to  Paus. 3.22.11,  Boia  was  founded  by lakedaimon  579 Boios  the  Heraklid,  who  brought  men  from  three  poleis,  Etis, Aphrodisia  and  Side;  but  since  Aphroditia  (no. 325)  existed in  C 5l  and  Side  (no. 344)  was  a  polis  in  or  not  long  before C 4m,  it  seems  that  the  three  did  not  disappear  early;  in  fact the  ruins  of  Etis  (no. 330)  were  still  visible  in  the  second  cen- tury  ad.  Neither  Aphroditia  nor  Side  is  attested  after  C 4 except  in  Paus. 3.22.11  (retrospectively)  and  Steph.  Byz. (derivatively).  Possibly  these  poleis  or  settlements  synoe- cised  with  an  existing  polis  of  Boia  in  the  late  Classical  peri- od,  perhaps  as  a  result  of  changes  in  the  Spartan  state following  369.See  further  Aphroditia  (no. 325),Etis  (no. 330) and  Side  (no. 344). The  collective  and  internal  use  of  the  city-ethnic  occurs only  on  Roman  coins  (Head,  HN \u00b2433).  The  collective and external  use  occurs  in  IG v.1932,  otherwise  only  in  literary texts  such  as  Paus. 3.23.13. Ps.-Skylax 46  lists  Boia  under  \u00b5   ,  and the  polis  can  be  assumed  to  have  been  perioikic  (cf.  Paus. 1.27.5  (r 456/5):   ).  The  only  evidence for  the  extent  of  its  territory,  or  for  cult  places,  is  post-C 4 (Paus. 3.23.2,  6).  Supposing  Boia  to  have  been  founded  in C 4m  (supra),  it  certainly  absorbed  the  territory of  Etis,  less than  a  mile  away  (if  Paus. 3.22.13  is  correctly  restored). Archaeological  evidence  for  the  Classical  polis  is  so  far lacking,  though  Paus. 3.22.13  mentions  temples  that  could  be Classical. 328.Chen  (Cheneus) Unlocated.  Type:  C.  (S 13).

Prt. 343A,  the  earliest  evidence  for  the  place.  Paus. 10.24.2  and Diod. 9  frr. 5\u00ad7  put  Chen,  birthplace  of  Myson  (one  of  the seven  wise  men),  in  Thessalia,  but  sources  cited  by  Diog.

Byz. 692.13;Aristox.fr. 130,Wehrli,apud  Diog.  Laert. 1.108  implicitly  calls  it  a  \u00b5. The  C 1  gravestone  of  a  Lakedaimonian  from  Koroneia (IG vii  2936)  is  the  only  epigraphic  evidence  for  the  external use  of  the  individual  city-ethnic  (in  the  form  );  the  lit- erary  evidence  comprises  Plato  and  Eudoxos  (supra). 329.

The few  genuine  attestations,  all  post-C 4,are of ,  e.g. IG v.1935  (Kythera,  C 2). Oitylos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  topographical  sense  by Pherekydes  (FGrHist 3)  fr. 168  using  the  unusual  expression \"the  polis  in  Sparta\";  but  as  he  is  writing  about  mythological material,  and  as  this  usage  is  unparalleled,  it  does  not amount  to reliable  evidence  of  polis  status  (cf.  Hansen  and Nielsen  ( 2000)  148\u00ad49). Paus.  locates  Oitylos  150  stades  ( 27  km)  from  Hippola ( 3.25.10)  and  c. 80  stades  (c. 15  km)  from  Thalamai  ( 3.26.1).  It is  near  modern  Oitylo  (formerly  Vitylo).  Architectural  frag- ments  found  in  churches  could  be  from  the  ancient  polis; part  of  a  possible  cult  building  has  been  uncovered,  and  a possible  defensive  wall  (AR  ( 4)  ( 1957)  10;  LS  ii. 300\u00ad1,  ll154; Waterhouse  and  Hope  Simpson  ( 1961)  121).  Pausanias' xoanon  of  Karneian  Apollo  in  the  agora  may  be  old.  The archaeological  evidence  to  date  is  too  imprecise  to confirm that  Oitylos  was  a  Classical  polis,  though  that  remains  a  pos- sibility. 341.

The  internal collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on  C 4  coins  (infra); the  external  collective  use  is  found  in  SEG 11  1211  ( 525\u00ad500), Thuc. 5.5.3  (supra),  and  Diod. 14.78.5  (r 396).  The  external individual  use  has  been  restored  in  Hermodorus,  De  Platone fr.  C. iii.35,  Lasserre  (rC 4\u00adC3)  (cf.  Steph.  Byz. 440.7  with Settis  ( 1965)  131;  Philippos  of  Opous  (FGrHist 1011)  fr. 1;  Test. 5  and  fr. 15b,  Lasserre). Medma  was  a  foundation  of  Lokroi  (no. 59;  Thuc. 5.5.3; Ps.-Skymnos  308;Strabo 6.1.5),  bordering  on  Lokroi  itself (Thuc. 5.5.3,  supra).  Archaeological  evidence  points  to  a foundation  in  C 7  (Paoletti  ( 1981b)  147).  The  scanty  evidence shows  very  varied  relations  with  the  metropolis:(a)  SEG 11 1211  ( 525\u00ad500)  is  a  dedication  by  Hipponion  (no. 53),  also  a Lokrian  colony,  Medma  and  Lokroi  (cf.  Lombardo  ( 1989) 429)  of  spoils  taken  from  Kroton  (no. 56)  and  thus  a  testi- mony  to  an  alliance  between  colony  and  metropolis;(b) Thuc. 5.5.3  (supra)  attests  to  a  war  between  Lokroi  and  its two  neighbouring  colonies  Medma  and  Hipponion  c. 422. See  further  Hipponion  (no. 53). The  foundation  of  Medma  (and  Hipponion)  was  the result  of  Lokrian  expansion  across  the  Aspromonte  through the  M\u00e9tramo  valley  to  gain  access  to  the  Tyrrhenian  Sea  by circumventing  Rhegion  (no. 68)  and  Messana  (no. 51)  at  the straits  (B\u00e9rard  ( 1957)  209\u00ad10;Settis  ( 1965)  121\u00ad22).As  a  result of  Lokrian  expansion,  the  Chalkidian  (Zanklaian)  site  of Metauros  on  the  Tyrrhenian  coast  near  Medma  came  under Lokrian  influence or e ven  occupation  (see  Metauros  (no. 62)).  For  the  chronology  of  the  Lokrian  expansion  there  is useful  evidence  from  local  indigenous  sites,  such  as  that from  Torre  Galli,  where  the  cemetery  reveals  Greek  influ- ence  C 7l\u00adC6m,  which  probably  coincides  with  the  founda- tion  of  Medma  and  Hipponion  (Guzzo  ( 1982b)  250).Studies in  the  hinterland  of  Medma  have  revealed  Greek  influence from  C 7l  (Cantarelli  ( 1974\u00ad75)  34\u00ad37).  The  chora  of  Medma was  the  Rosarno  valley  and  the  lower  slopes  of  the Aspromonte,  the  crest  of  these  hills  dividing  Medma  from Lokrian  territory;  in  all,  the  territory  measured  c. 100 km \u00b2.  According  to  Strabo  6.1.5,  Medma  had  a  harbour named  Emporion,  the  location  of  which  is  uncertain  (Settis ( 1989)),  though  some  locate  it  at  Nicotera  (cf.  Pontrandolfo ( 1993)). An  alliance  between  Lokroi  (cf.  Lombardo  ( 1989)  429), Hipponion  and  Medma  is  attested  by  SEG 11  1211  ( 525\u00ad500), a  joint  dedication  by  these  cities  at  Olympia  of  spoils  taken from  Kroton  (Settis  ( 1965)  122).  Some  kind  of  treaty  with  or dependency  upon  Kroton  is  probably  indicated  by C 5e Krotoniate  coinage  with  the  legend  (Settis  ( 1965)  123 and  Gorini  ( 1985);  rejected  by Moltrasio  ( 1972\u00ad73)  175;  cf. infra).  Thucydides'  phrasing  at  5.5.3  (supra):  `  \u00b5 \u00b5,  suggests  that Hipponion  and  Medma  were  allies  in  the  war  against  Lokroi c. 422. In 396,  Dionysios  I  of  Syracuse  relocated  4,000  Med- maians  to  Sicilian  Messana  (no. 51;Diod.  14.78.5);  if  this  is correct  (and  it  was  disputed  by,  for  example,  Beloch  ( 1923) iii. 2190),  it  probably  meant  a  depopulation  of  Medma,  but depopulation  is  not  supported  by  the  archaeological  evi- dence  (Paoletti  ( 1981b)  150).  When  the  populations  of Kaulonia  (no. 55)  and  Hipponion  (no. 53)  were  relocated  to Sicily  in  389  (Diod. 14.106.3,  107.2),  Dionysios  handed  over their  territories  to Lokroi  (no. 59),  and  it  is  not  impossible that  the  same  happened  in  the  case  of  Medma  (RE  xii. 2. 1333).  The  figure of 4,000  is  the  only  indication  of  the  order of  size  of  the  Medmaian  population,  and  if  it  is  historical,  it probably  refers  to  the  entire  population  (Settis  ( 1965)  125). The  settlement  of  Medma  was  located  on  the  site  of present-day  Rosarno  and  has  therefore  been  accessible  to sporadic  investigations  only.  The  ancient  site  joined  a  larger plateau  by a  narrow,  easily  defendable  isthmus.  The  larger plateau  had  an  extent  of  about  130\u00ad140  ha,  but  the  urbanised area  in  its  western  part  comprised  only  about  30\u00ad35  ha  (sur- veys:  Paoletti  ( 1981a)  47\u00ad54  fig. 8;(2001)).  There  are  traces  of habitation  from  the  Archaic  and  Hellenistic  periods,  with evidence  of  C 5s  urban  layout  joining  habitation  areas  and sanctuaries  (Sabbione  ( 1981a);  Paoletti  and  Parra  ( 1985)). The  C 4  remains  conflict w ith  the  passage  in  Diodorus describing  the  C 4e  deportation  of  the  inhabitants  of  Medma to  Messana  by  Dionysios  I  (Diod. 14.78.5;  cf.  Paoletti  ( 1981b) 278 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo 150),  at  least  if  this  passage  is  taken  to  indicate  complete depopulation. The  sanctuaries  seem  to  have  been  situated  on  the  out- skirts  of  the  habitation  area  (Iannelli  ( 1996)).  Most  of  the archaeological  evidence  is  from  votive  deposits  and  not from  structural  remains  (Orsi  ( 1913);  Paoletti  ( 1996c);  Hinz ( 1998)  209\u00ad10).  The  votive terracottas  are  associated  above all  with  the  C 5f  cult  of  Kore and  Persephone.  Finds  also emphasise  the  importance  of  Athena  Promachos  and  possi- bly  Athena  Hippia  (Orsi  ( 1913)  100\u00ad7;  Agostino  ( 1996)).  The Athena  Promachos  could  indicate  a  poliad  cult.  On  the north-eastern  edge  of  the  plateau  (zone  \"S.  Anna\")  outside the  urban  centre,  C 6\u00adC4  votive  deposits  are  evidence  of  a temenos  with  a  cult  of  Athena,  revealed  by  figurines of Athena  enthroned,  and  also  of  Athena  Hippia  as  shown  by several  horse  figurines (Parra ( 1996a);  Hinz  ( 1998)  210). C 3\u00adC2  epigraphical  evidence  attests  a  cult  of  Demeter (Cygielman  ( 1980)). A  C 5\u00adC4  cemetery  has  been  investigated  on  the  confining plateau  (Lattanzi  ( 1988)  591\u00ad92). Medma  began  striking  coins  in  C 4f,  contemporaneously with  the  metropolis  Lokroi  Epizephyrioi  (no. 59).  However, an  earlier  coinage  was  issued  as  an  ally  or  dependency  of Kroton,  probably  as  early  as  C 5e,  as  is  indicated  by  two Krotoniate  series  of  staters  carrying  the  legend :  the first  series  has  obv.  eagle  standing  on  Ionic  capital,  legend ;  rev.  tripod,  corn-grain,  legend and  in  exer- gue (Gorini  ( 1985)  130\u00ad31);  the  second  series,  more uncertainly interpreted as a Medmaian-Krotoniate coinage,  has  obv.  head  of  Hera  Lakinia;  rev.  seated  Herakles holding  cup,  legends: and  (Gorini  ( 1985)  131);  for  the  historical  context  of  this coinage,  see  Gorini  ( 1985)  128\u00ad33;  however,  for  the  rejection of  such  an  alliance  coinage,  see  Rutter,  HN \u00b3,p.  168.  Staters of  Corinthian  type  were  issued  under  the  influence  of Syracuse  and  Dionysios  I  from  C 4m;  two  types  have  been documented:  ( 1)  obv.  winged  Pegasos  and  monogram  of the  letters ;  rev.  helmeted  head  of  Athena  (Gorini ( 1985)  133;Rutter,  HN \u00b32424;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1899);  ( 2)  obv. winged  Pegasos;  rev.  head  of  Athena  and  letter  M  (Gorini ( 1985)  133;Rutter,  HN \u00b32425).  Bronze  coinage  was  issued from  C 4e,  the  obvs.  depicting  heads  of  Apollo  and Persephone  (?)  and  the  revs.  the  nymph  Mesma  or  Pan, with  various  similar  types;  the  obv.or  rev.  carries  the  leg- end (Gorini  ( 1985)  136\u00ad38;Rutter,  HN \u00b3 2426ff;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1900\u00ad1),  while  some  obvs.are inscribed ,  possibly  a  reference  to  the  epony- mous  nymph  (Guarducci,  EG  ii. 626). In 525\u00ad500,  Medma,  with  Hipponion  (no. 53)  and  Lokroi (no. 59)  (cf.  Lombardo  ( 1989)  429),  dedicated  at  Olympia spoils  taken  from  Kroton  (no. 56)  (SEG 11  1211). 61. ", "Kroton": "Identifier: 58. , was  famous  for  its  athletes  (Strabo  6.1.12), who  achieved  an  amazing  number  of  victories  (cf.  Miller ( 2000)  286\u00ad87;  Mann  ( 2001)  164\u00ad91),  of  which  twenty-six are  mentioned  in  our  sources  (Olympionikai 38,  87,  90,  92, 100,104,109,115,122,126,129,133,135,139,145,148,153,166,172, 178,  179,  186,  187,  196,  197,  198).  Astylos,  however,  the  winner of  various  races  in  484  and 480,  was  on  both  occasions  pro- claimed  a  Syrakosios  (cf.  Mann  ( 2001)  188\u00ad89,  246\u00ad48).  One of  the  most  famous  Krotoniate  athletes,  Phayllos,  never achieved  an  Olympic  victory,  but  was  a  triple  Pythionikes prior  to 480  (Hdt. 8.47  (twice  in  the  pentathlon  and  once  in running:  Paus. 10.9.2);  cf.  RE  xix. 2.  1903\u00ad4). Architectural  fragments  of  Krotoniate  type  from Olympia  and  Delphi  may  testify  to  Krotoniate  thesauroi (Heiden  ( 1990)  44;  Mertens-Horn  and  Viola  ( 1990)  244\u00ad45). LSAG 104.22  SEG 40  426  ( 510\u00ad470)  is  an  external  com- munal  dedication  to Pythian  Apollo,  presumably  of  spoils taken  from  Sybaris.  SEG 11  1211  (C 5),  on  the  other  hand,  is  a dedication  at  Olympia  of  spoils  taken  from  Kroton  and  ded- icated  by the  Hipponians  (no. 53),  the  Medmaians  (no. 60) and  the  Lokrians  (no. 59)  (cf.  Lombardo  ( 1989)  429).  C 5s Krotoniate  publication  of  a  public  document  at  Delphi  is attested  at  Iambl.  VP 263.  Communal  consultation  of  the Delphic  oracle  is  reported  by  Just.  Epit. 20.2.5,  3.1\u00ad3  (rC 6s). Kroton  minted  an  incuse  coinage  on  the  Achaian  stand- ard  from  c. 530,  mainly  staters  and  drachms.  The  principal type,  and  sole  type  initially,  is  the  Delphic  tripod,  legend: ,  ,  ,  (Stazio  ( 1983a)  369\u00ad74; Parise  ( 1990b);  Rutter,  HN \u00b32075\u00ad94,  2100\u00ad6;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1735\u00ad64).  The  tripod  refers  to  the  importance  of  the  cult  of the  Pythian  Apollo,  alluded  to  more  specifically on C 5l  types (infra).  For  Apollo  Pythios  at  Kroton:  Iambl.  VP, 28.9\u00ad10, 35.261,  discussed  by  Maddoli  ( 1983)  336.  A  variant  type  with a  flying eagle on the rev.  (Stazio  ( 1983a)  375\u00ad77;Rutter,  HN \u00b3 2095,  2108;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1765\u00ad69)  is  either  an  \"alliance\"  or \"dominion\"  coin  (unknown  alliance  city;  Kraay  ( 1976)  168 suggests  Hipponion)  or  a  reference  to Zeus  at  Kroton  or  to special  ties  between  Kroton  and  Olympia--an interpreta- tion  perhaps  supported  by  later  issues  with  a  seated  eagle  on a  column  (infra)  (Stazio  ( 1983a)  375\u00ad76).  The  dominion issues  (supra;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  p. 168)  all  have  the  Krotoniate  tri- pod  on  the  obv.,  with  legend  whereas  the  rev.type varies:  Sybaris  (no. 70.II):  bull  standing  r.  looking  back, legend: (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  2098);  Pandosia  (no. 64):  bull standing  r.  looking  back  (relief  in  incuse  square),  legend: italia  and  kampania  269 (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  2097);  Temesa  (no. 72):  tripod,  leg- end: also  C 5  stater,  double  relief,  obv.  tripod,  legend: ;  rev.  helmet,  legend  (Gorini  ( 1975)  26\u00ad27;Rutter, HN \u00b3  2080  with  refs.;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1828). Smaller  denominations  (triobols,  diobols  and  obols)  in double  relief  were  minted  from  C 6l  and  through  the  C 5:  obv. tripod;  rev.  a  variety  of  types  known  from  other  mints: Pegasos,  cuttlefish,  hare,  cock,  crab  and  wheel  (Stazio ( 1983a)  377\u00ad80;Rutter,  HN \u00b32125ff;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1785\u00ad94). The  issue  is  explained  as  denominations  used  to  make  up the  weight  of  Krotoniate  staters  to that  of  coins  minted  on other  standards,  or  as  politically  motivated  issues  (Stazio ( 1983a)  381\u00ad84;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  p. 170). The  full  transition  from  an  incuse  to  a  double-relief coinage  took  place  c. 435,  at  first w ith  the  tripod  on  both  obv. and  rev.(Rutter,  HN \u00b32113\u00ad19;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1770\u00ad72),  the obv.  type  later  replaced  by  other  types:  an  eagle  seated  on  an Ionic  capital  (Stazio  ( 1983a)  384\u00ad85;Rutter,  HN \u00b32141;  SNG Cop.  Italy 1775\u00ad81);  Herakles  seated  and  the  legend claiming  Herakles  as  founder  of  the  city  (cf. Diod. 4.24.7;  Stazio  ( 1983a)  385;Rutter,  HN \u00b32139;  SNG  Cop. Italy 1773\u00ad74).  The  cult  of  the  Pythian  Apollo  is  alluded  to  in types  with  Apollo  shooting  arrows  at  the  Python  (Lacroix ( 1965)  158\u00ad61;Rutter,  HN \u00b32140;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1773).  By  C 5l  the  is  replaced  by and by ,  with  legends  , , , , . Types  on  the  later  issues  include  obv.  head  of  Hera Lakinia,  rev.  seated  Herakles  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  2159;  SNG  Cop. Italy 1800\u00ad4),  both  types  reflecting the importance of Kroton  in  the  Italiote  League  (Stazio  ( 1983a)  390\u00ad94).A  C 4e type  with  the  infant  Herakles  strangling  snakes  was  also adopted  by  a  number  of  cities  in  Asia  Minor,  reflecting a monetary  league  or  a  common  use  of  \"Greek  fighting Barbarian\"  symbolism  (Stazio  ( 1983a)  391\u00ad92;Rutter,  HN \u00b3 2157;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1804\u00ad5).Bronze  coinage  was  introduced c. 400  (Stazio  ( 1983a)  394\u00ad95;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  2202ff;  SNG  Cop. Italy 1821\u00ad27). Kroton  was  the  metropolis  of  Kaulonia  (no. 55)  (Ps.- Skymnos  318\u00ad19),  founded  in  C 7s,  and  of  Terina  (no. 73) (Ps.-Skymnos  306\u00ad7),  founded  at  the  latest  c. 460. 57.Kyme  (Kymaios) Map  44.  Lat. 40.50,long.  14.05.  Size of  territory: 4.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is  \u00b5,  (Thuc. 6.4.5),  spelled  \u00b5  on  C 5f  coins  (infra);  the  Doric  form  is \u00b5  (ML 29  ( 474));  it  is  qualified b y   '  at  Diod. 11.51.1  (r 474).  The  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5  (C 5f  coins,  infra; Diod. 11.51.2  (r 474)). Kyme  is  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  at  Thuc. 6.4.5 (cf.  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.6.4  (rC 6l)),  and  it  called  polis Hellenis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Ps.-Skylax  10  (cf.  Dion.  Hal. Ant.  Rom. 7.4.1  (rC 6l);  Diod. 12.76.4  (r 421)).  The  internal collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  on  C 5  coins (infra).  The  external  collective  use  is  found  in  Dion.  Hal. Ant.  Rom. 7.4.3  (rC 6l),  Diod. 11.51.2  (r 474)  and  12.76.4 (r 421).  The  external  individual  use  is  found  in  Paus. 10.12.8 (rHell.). Kyme  was  the  earliest  of  the  Greek  colonies  in  Italy  and Sicily  (Strabo  5.4.4).  The  archaeological  evidence  indicates Greek  settlers  at  Kyme  from  c. 750\u00ad725,  which  is  contempor- ary  with  the  earliest  Greek  evidence  from  Pithekoussai,  thus suggesting  a  first settlement phase c ontemporary  with  that site  (d'Agostino  ( 1999a)  54,(1999b)  207\u00ad11).  The  city  was founded  by  Euboian  Chalkis  (no. 365)  (Thuc. 6.4.5:  ) or by Chalkis and Eretria (no.  370) (Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.3).  According  to  Strabo  5.4.4,  there were  two  groups  of  settlers:  one  led  by  Hippokles  from Euboian  Kyme,  and  one  led  by  Megasthenes  from  Chalkis. Kyme's  hinterland  was  fertile,  but  the  city  was  a  maritime settlement  (Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.3.2  (r 524/3)).  There  is  a tradition  of  harbour  stations  in  Kymaian  territory,  such  as Dikaiarcheia,  which  may  have  been  an  epineion  Kymaion during  its  early  history  (Strabo  5.4.6  (rC 8\u00adC7?));  however,  at this  site  mineral  extraction  may  also  have  played  a  role  (cf. Mele  ( 1979)  43\u00ad45;  and  Dikaiarcheia  in  the  list  of  non-polis sites,  supra).  Kymaian  territory  extended  southwards  to  the site  of  Parthenope,  perhaps  originally  one  of  the  epineia  of Kyme  (Strabo  5.4.7;  cf.  Parthenope  in  the  list  of  non-polis sites,  supra).  Neapolis  (no. 63)  was  probably  founded  as  a  C 5 colony  of  Kyme.  Kymaian  territory  extended  northwards  to the  river  Klanios,  the  border  between  the  Greek  and Etruscan  areas  of  influence (Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.3.3 (r 524/3)).  The  territory  comprised  c. 280  km \u00b2  (Frederiksen ( 1984)  68\u00ad69  map 2).  There  is  little  evidence  of  sanctuaries in  Kymaian  territory;  however,  the  Demeter  sanctuary  on the  north-west  plateau  of  Neapolis  predates  the  foundation of  this  city  and  may  perhaps  be  taken  as  evidence  of  a  rural sanctuary  in  Kymaian  territory  (E.  Greco  ( 1987a)  488\u00ad89), and  traditions  about  the  travels  of  Herakles  point  to  rural sanctuaries  dedicated  to  this  hero.  The  cultural  influence of Greek  Kyme  in  the  Italic  regions  should  not  be  underesti- mated,  a  salient  point  being  the  Euboic-Kymaian  origin  of the  Etruscan  alphabet.  The  political  influence of  Kyme  in Central  Italy  was  considerable  already  in  C 6l,as  indicated  by the  embassy  sent  by  Aricia  to  Kyme  asking  for  help  against the  Etruscans  (Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.5.1). 270 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo Numerous  military  confrontations  with  non-Greek  pop- ulations  are  on  record  (cf.  Mele  ( 1987)):  in  524,  the  city defeated  an  invading  force  of  Etruscans,  Umbrians  and Daunians  (Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.3);  in  504,  Kyme  success- fully  supported  Aricia  and  defeated  Etruscan  forces  (Dion. Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.5);  in  474,  Kyme  in  alliance  with  Hieron  of Syracuse  defeated  Etruscans  in  a  great  naval  battle  off  Kyme (Diod. 11.51;  cf.  ML  29);  and  in  421,Kyme  fell  to  the  Samnites, who  subjected  the  city  to  an  exandrapodismos  and  resettled it  themselves  (Diod. 12.76.4),  while  surviving  Kymaians  fled to  Neapolis  (Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 15.6.5;  Lomas  ( 2000)  178). An  alliance  with  Aricia  is  attested  by  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.5.2  (rC 6l).  An  alliance  with  Hieron  of  Syracuse  is  attested by Diod. 11.51.1,  and  this  alliance  defeated  Etruscan  forces  in the  great  naval  battle  at  Kyme  in  474  (Diod. 11.51.2  (r 474);  cf. ML 29). Kyme  was  conquered  by  Kampanians  in  421,but  although the  city  was  subjected  to  exandrapodismos  and  resettled  with Kampanians,  Greek  culture  survived  (Diod. 12.76.4;Strabo 5.4.4),  and  Ps.-Skylax  10  lists  Kyme  as  a  polis  Hellenis. Exiles  during  the  tyranny  of  Aristodamos  are  mentioned at  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.10.4.  Sending  of  envoys  is  attested at  Diod. 11.51.1  (r  c. 474);  reception  of  envoys  is  attested  at Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.5.1  (rC 6l). According  to  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.3.4,  Kyme  in  C 6l, during  the  conflicts w ith  the  Etruscans,  raised  an  army  of 4,500  foot  and  600  horse;  the  city  also  possessed  a  navy  at this  time  (ibid.,  cf. 7.5.3  for  a  navy  amounting  to  ten  ships). A  hipparches  is  mentioned  at  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.4.4 (rC 6l).A  strategos  is  mentioned  by  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.5.2 (rC 6l). Information  on  the  C 6l  constitution  and  political  institu- tions  is  found  in  the  account  by  Dionysios  of  Halikarnassos of  the  tyranny  of  Aristodamos  ( 504\u00ad490);  this  account  is influenced b y  stereotypical  perceptions  of  tyranny  (Berve ( 1967)  160),  and  it  is  uncertain  to  what  degree  the  informa- tion  on  the  political  organisation  of  Kyme  found  in  it  is  his- torical.  With  that  caveat,  it  may  be  noted  that  according  to Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.4.4,  Kyme  before  the  rise  of Aristodamos  was  an  aristocracy  (described  as  an  oligarchy at 7.6.4;  Ghinatti  ( 1996)  120\u00ad22).  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.4.4\u00ad5  refers  to a  boule  (cf. 7.5.2),  and  a  bouleuterion  is  men- tioned  at  7.7.3.The  citizen  body  is  depicted  as  divided  into   and \u00b5  which  was      ( 7.4.4\u00ad5).  At  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.7.3  is  a  general  reference to     .  After  the  C 6l  victory  over  the  Etruscans, Aristodamos  emerged  as  prostates  tou  demou  (Dion.  Hal. Ant.  Rom. 7.4.5)  by  demagogia,  and  this  implies  the  existence of  an  assembly  (cf. 7.5.2  and at 7.7.5).  After  a  suc- cessful  command  in  war  against  the  Etruscans  in  support  of Aricia  ( 7.5\u00ad7),  Aristodamos  launched  a  coup  d'\u00e9tat  and  took power  as  tyrant,  and,  according  to  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.8.1, carried  out  a     \u00b5     etc.  as  a stereotypical  tyrant.  After  the  overthrow  of  Aristodamos, the  patrios  politeia  was  restored  (Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.11.4). Death  sentences  passed  by  the  C 6  aristocracy/oligarchy are  mentioned  in  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.7.4  (rC 6l). Kyme  occupied  a  high,  isolated  plateau  in  the  Phlegraian Fields  north  of  Cape  Misenum.  The  settlement  was  founded on  the  saddle  between  the  acropolis  near  the  coast  and Monte  Grillo  inland.  The  Greeks  replaced  an  indigenous settlement,  though  it  is  uncertain  whether  they  did  so directly  or  after  some  hiatus  (d'Agostino  ( 1999a)  61).  The acropolis  and  the  settlement  plateau  were  fortified from at least  C 6m,  and  possibly  already  from  C 6e,  by  a  circuit  wall built  in  isodomic  ashlars,  a  double  curtain-wall  with  inter- nal  fill (Pagano ( 1993);  d'Agostino  ( 1999b)  208\u00ad9).  Sea- wards  and  eastwards  along  the  Monte  Grillo  the  walls exploited  the  natural  steep  slopes;  to  north  and  south  the plateau  was  accessible  from  the  hinterland  and  the  wall  was strengthened  and  provided  with  fortified g ates,  and  proba- bly  also  with  an  external  ditch  along  the  stretch  facing Capuan  and  Etruscan  territories  (d'Agostino  ( 1999a)  54; Fratta  ( 2002)  61).  The  walls  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 80  ha, including  the  acropolis  and  part  of  the  Monte  Grillo  which has  revealed  some  traces  of  habitation  in  the  Archaic  period (Fratta  ( 2002)  68). There  are  few  urban  remains  from  the  Greek  period,  but it  is  likely  that  the  agora  preceded  the  Roman  forum  and  that the  Roman  road  system  followed  an  earlier  Greek  system. There  is  also  some  evidence  of  a  diateichisma  wall  dividing the  western  and  eastern  city  quarters  (D'Onofrio  ( 2002) 136\u00ad40).  From  the  description  of  Aristodamos'  homecom- ing  after  the  victory  at  Aricia  in  504  (Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.7.1)  it  is  apparent  that  Kyme  had  at  least  two  harbours. These  were  probably  located  below  the  acropolis,  but  any evidence  has  been  obliterated  by  the  Roman  harbour  struc- tures,  by  silting  and  by  bradyseisms  (Paget  ( 1968)  152\u00ad59; Morhauge  et al.( 2002)).  Kyme  had  other  harbour  facilities in  the  bay  of  Misenum  (Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.3.2  (r 524/3)). Part  of  the  substructures  of  the  Roman  \"Temple  of  Zeus\" on  the  acropolis  is  from  a  C 5m  monumental  Greek  temple (Burelli  and  Valenza  Mele  ( 1989)  19).  The  sanctuary  of Apollo  (Paus. 8.24.5)  was  located  on  the  lower  terrace  of  the acropolis  (cf.,  however,  Clark  ( 1977)  483  n. 8);  the  only  Greek italia  and  kampania  271 remains  are  those  of  the  C 5  stereobate  of  a  peripteral  temple (Frederiksen  ( 1984)  75).  On  the  south-eastern  slope  of  the acropolis  the  subterranean  galleries,\"Cave  of  the  Sibyl\",  is  at least  in  part  C 6\u00adC5,  but  the  function  of  the  structure  (an oracular  cult,  a  heroon  or  tomb)  is  uncertain  (Clark  ( 1977) 484,fig.  1).  The  only  identified sanctuary on the city plateau is  an  Archaic  shrine  in  the  outermost  south-western  corner of  the  city,  inside  the  circuit  wall,  probably  a  C 7  Heraion (Valenza  Mele  ( 1977)  500,  524;  Pagano  ( 1993)  fig. 1.2;  Fratta ( 2002)  49,  69).  The  epigraphic  evidence  for  a  Hera  cult  at Kyme  goes  back  to  c. 650;  she  was  possibly  an  oracular  divin- ity  with  precedence  over  Apollo  (IGDGG  no. 14;  cf.  no. 15). The  cemeteries  are  of  the  utmost  importance  for  the study  of  Kymaian  history  (G\u00e1brici  ( 1913)).  They  define the limits  of  the  city  from  the  C 8,  occupying  quite  an  extensive area  already  from  this  period,  and  with  single  tombs,  among the  most  ancient,  found  up  to  3  km  from  the  city  without evidence  of  smaller  Greek  satellite  settlements.  Rich,  aristo- cratic  C 8l\u00adC7e  tombs  show  close  similarities  with  aristo- cratic  tombs  in  Eretria,  thus  revealing  close  ties  between  the two  cities  in  a  period  not  long  after  the  foundation  of  Kyme (Albore-Livadie  ( 1979)). Kyme  began  striking  coins  c. 475.  Three  weight  standards were  employed  in  the  early  coinage  of  Kyme,  the  earliest issues  being  drachms  on  the  Chalkidian  (a  single  specimen is  known)  and  didrachms  on  the  Euboic\u00adAttic  standard (Rutter  ( 1979)  15\u00ad16,  91;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  p. 66).  The  Attic  stan- dard  most  likely  derived  from  Syracuse  and  may  reflect the alliance  with  Hieron  and  the  establishment  of  a  Syracusan garrison  on  Pithekoussai  in  C 5f  (cf.  Strabo  5.4.9;Rutter ( 1979)  93).  Types:  obv.  lion's  scalp  flanked on either side  by boar's  heads;  rev.  mussel  shell;  legends: , (Rutter  ( 1979)  9\u00ad10;Rutter,  HN \u00b3513\u00ad14). Shortly  after  the  initial  coinage,  Kyme  adopted  the  Phokaian standard  from  Hyele;  the  same  types  were  employed  in  the different  issues.  The  heraldic  motif  was  probably  an  allusion to  the  temple  of  Apollo  where  the  Kymaians  kept  the  teeth  of the  Erymanthian  boar  killed  by  Herakles  (Paus. 8.24.5; Lacroix  ( 1965)  142\u00ad46;  Rutter  ( 1979)  9\u00ad10;Rutter,  HN \u00b3515). The  type  was  revived  on  C 5l  issues.  The  lion's  scalp  is  above all  known  as  a  Samian  type  and  may  reflect Samian parti- cipation  in  the  settlement  at  Dikaiarcheia  in  C 6l  (see Dikaiarcheia  in  the  list  of  non-polis  sites,  supra).  To  the  same early  period  are  attributed  two  gold  issues:  obv.  female  head, or  helmet;  rev.  on  both,  mussel  shell  (Rutter  ( 1979)  17\u00ad18; Rutter,  HN \u00b3511\u00ad12).  Later  issues  of  didrachms:  obv.  lion's scalp  and  boar's  heads;  rev.  female  head,  perhaps  a  nymph personifying  the  city  (Rutter  ( 1979)  11;Rutter,HN  \u00b3520;  SNG Cop.  Italy 357).  Smaller  denominations  are  drachms  and obols.  The  rendering  of  some  rev.  types  reveals  Syracusan artistic  influence.  The  most  consistent  issue  has  as  obv.type the  female  head  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3521,  528,  SNG  Cop.  Italy 358\u00ad68).  An  obv.  type  of  Athena  with  Corinthian  helmet  is modelled  on  Corinthian  types  and  must  also  reflect Syracusan  influence (Rutter ( 1979)  11,  94\u00ad95;Rutter, HN \u00b3524;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 369).  Nearly  all  series  have  a  mussel  shell  as  rev.  type,  though  with  different  secondary motifs  such  as  a  crab--of  special  interest  as  evidence  of Himeran\u00adAkragantine  influence or e ven  of  an  otherwise unknown  alliance  (Rutter  ( 1979)  12,  92;Rutter,  HN \u00b3524); rev.  legends: or .  After  the  Samnite occupation  of  Kyme,  c. 430\u00ad420,  the  mint  was  closed  and minting  for  Kyme  and  other  Kampanian  cities  was  trans- ferred  to  Neapolis,  where  coins  continued  to  be  struck  in  the name  of  Kyme  (Rutter  ( 1979)  8\u00ad41,  91\u00ad96). A  public  festival  is  attested  for  C 6l  in  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 7.11.3.  The  numismatic  evidence  (supra)  suggests  cults  of Athena,  Herakles  and  Apollo,  and  possibly  the  nymph Kyme.  Communal  oracle  consultation  in  C 5e  is  implied  by Ps.-Skymnos  243. According  to  Thuc. 6.4.5,  leistai  from  Kyme  were  the  original  settlers  of  Zankle  (no. 51).  Neapolis  (no. 63)  was probably  a  C 5  foundation  of  Kyme  (Strabo  5.4.7). 58. ", "Hipponion": "Identifier: 263, (Hipponieus) Map  46.  Lat. 38.40,long. 16.05.  Size  of  territory: 3.  Type:  [A].  The  toponym  is ,  (Archestratos  fr. 35.8,  Olson  and  Sens).  The corresponding  city-ethnic  is  found  as  in  SEG 11 1211  ( 525\u00ad500),and  C 4  coins  (infra)  use  the  form   (abbreviated  as  on  the  earliest  C 4  coins:  RE  viii.A. 2005:  Lombardo  ( 1989)  452);  Ps.-Skylax  12  and  Douris (FGrHist 76)  fr. 19  have  `  for  the  toponym ( `  is  found  at  App.  B  Civ. 5.91).  The  correspon- ding  city-ethnic  `  is  found  at  Dion.  Hal.  Ant. Rom. 20.7.3  (r 388)  and  F.Delphes iii.1  179  (C 4l\u00adC3e);  at  Thuc. 5.5.3  the  MSS  have  ',which is commonly and prob- ably  correctly  emended  to `  or `  (cf. Hornblower ( 1996)  434\u00ad35;  Lombardo  ( 1989)  452);  but Steph.  Byz. 342.10  does  mention  an  '  ... ' (which  may,  however,  be  identical  with  Hipponion:  RE viii.A. 2004\u00ad5;  contra  Lombardo  ( 1989)  452).  Finally,  Diod. 15.24.1  (r 379)  has  `,  and `  is  found in  SEG 2635  (Hell.). Hipponion  is  one  of  ten  toponyms  listed  at  Ps.-Skylax  12 after  the  heading    ` ,where polis is  used  in  the  urban  sense  (cf.  Douris  (FGrHist 76)  fr. 19  and Diod. 14.107.2  (r 388));  Thuc. 5.5.3  calls  the  Hipponieis apoikoi  of  the  Lokrians.  The  internal  collective  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  on  C 4  coins  (infra);  the  external  col- lective  use  is  attested  by SEG 11  1211  ( 525\u00ad500),  probably  by Thuc. 5.5.3  (supra)  and  by  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 20.7.3  (r 388) and  Diod. 15.24.1  (r 379);  the  external  individual  use  is  found in  F.Delphes iii.1176  (C 4l\u00adC3e),  which  describes  a  man  as      '[] `  (infra). Hipponion  was  a  colony  founded  by Lokroi  (no. 59) (Thuc. 5.5.3;  cf.  Ps.-Skymnos  308  and  Strabo  6.1.5). Archaeological  evidence  points  to  a  foundation  in  C 7l (infra).  The  scanty  evidence  shows  very  varied  relations between  Hipponion  and  its  metropolis:(a)  SEG 11  1211 ( 525\u00ad500),  a  joint  dedication  by  Hipponion,  Medma  (no. 60)  (also  a  Lokrian  colony),  and  Lokroi  (cf.  Lombardo ( 1989)  429)  at  Olympia  of  spoils  taken  from  Kroton  (no. 56), implies  a  military  alliance  between  colony  and  mother  city, but  has  nothing  on  its  origin  or  duration  (Hornblower ( 1996)  434\u00ad35),  and  nothing  about  the  political  status  of Hipponion  vis-\u00e0-vis  Lokroi  (Lombardo  ( 1989)  428\u00ad31);  (b) Thuc. 5.5.3  attests  to  a  war  between  Lokroi  and  Hipponion and  Medma  but  gives  no  explanation  of  the  issues  involved (see  further  Lombardo  ( 1989)  431\u00ad40);  (c)  F.Delphes iii.1176 (C 4l\u00adC3e)  is  a  Delphic  grant  of  proxeny  etc.  to  a  man  described  as       '[] `;  this  unique  combination  of  city-ethnics  pre- sumably  indicates  some  kind  of  political  interdependence between  the  two  communities  (Graham  ( 1964)  94;Savalli ( 1989)  467),  but  (pace  Graham  ( 1964)  94\u00ad95)  this  evidence can  hardly  be  retrojected  into  the  Archaic  and  Classical  peri- ods  (cf.  Hornblower  ( 1996)  434\u00ad35). Evidence  from  cemeteries  and  sanctuaries  points  to  a  C 7l foundation  date  for  Hipponion  (infra),  confirmed b y Greek influence in local,  indigenous  tombs--for instance at T orre Galli  (Arslan  ( 1986)  esp. 1031\u00ad32,  1042,  1052\u00ad54;  Lombardo ( 1989)  424  n. 29).Evidence  of  Greek  presence  in  the  territory of  Hipponion  comes  primarily  from  the  area  between  the city  and  the  coast,  where  ceramic  evidence  indicates  Greek presence  from  C 6  (see  also  the  entry  for  Medma).  The italia  and  kampania  261 coastal  chora  of  Hipponion  was  consolidated  by  C 5:  the  evi- dence  is  a  coastal  sanctuary  (dedicated  to  Persephone?)  and C 5\u00adC4  remains  of,  presumably,  agricultural  and  maritime structures  (Ianelli  ( 1989);  Givigliano  ( 1989)  745\u00ad46).  The coastal  plain,  between  Nicotera  and  the  river  Angitula,  cov- ers  about  120  km \u00b2,  but  the  territory of  Hipponion  would have  comprised  about  200  km \u00b2  if  the  valleys  south  of  the  city were  part  of  the  territory.  Agathokles  of  Syracuse  built  an epineion  (Strabo  6.1.5),  and  remains  of  this  have  been  iden- tified on the c oast  below  Hipponion  between  the  rivers  S. Anna  and  Trainiti  at  Castello  Bivona  and  Porto  Salvo  (Lena ( 1989)  601\u00ad7).  The  route  between  Hipponion  and  the  coast was  consolidated  by  C 5,  with  an  extra-urban  sanctuary  near the  coast  at  Castello  Bivona  (Givigliano  ( 1989)  748\u00ad51). Hipponion  may  have  been  a  member  of  the  Italiote League  (Lombardo  ( 1989)  438).  An  alliance  of  Hipponion with  Lokroi  (cf.  Lombardo  ( 1989)  429)  and,  presumably, Medma  in  C 6l  is  implied  by  SEG 11  1211  ( 525\u00ad500),  a  joint dedication  by  these  three  cities  of  spoils  taken  from  Kroton. Thucydides'  phrasing  at  5.5.3  (  `  \u00b5 \u00b5)  suggests  that  Hipponion  and Medma  were  allies  in  the  war  against  Lokroi  c. 422. In 388  Hipponion  was  conquered  by Dionysios  I  of Syracuse,  who  relocated  the  inhabitants  to  Syracuse  (no. 47),  razed  the  city,  and  handed  over  its  territory  to  the Lokrians  (Diod. 14.107.2;  cf.  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 20.7.3). Apparently,  not  all  Hipponieis  were  relocated;  at  least,  when describing  the  refoundation  of  the  city  at  15.24.1  (r 379), Diodorus  states  that  the  Carthaginians  restored  the  city  to the  \"Hipponiates  in  exile\",  and  these  may  have  been  exiled when  Dionysios  took  the  city;  Diodorus'  phrasing  leaves open  the  possibility  that  exiles  other  than  Hipponieis  were settled  in  the  refounded  city  (Lombardo  ( 1989)  439).  In  356, the  city  was  subdued  by  the  Brettians  (Diod. 16.15.2);  but  any long-lasting  Brettian  possession  of  the  city  is  hardly  to  be assumed  (cf.  Lombardo  ( 1989)  440\u00ad43). F.Delphes iii.1176  (C 4l\u00adC3e)  is  a  grant  of  proxeny  etc.  by Delphi  (no. 177)  to  a  man  described  as     '[] `  (supra). Hipponion  was  founded  on  a  steep-sided  plateau  c. 500  m above  sea  level.  There  are  no  traces  of  the  Greek  urban  lay- out  or  habitation  structures,  which  have  all  been  obliterated by  the  mediaeval  city.  However,  the  extant  remains  of  the  c. 6 km-long  circuit  wall  and  the  morphology  of  the  site  indicate a  fortified area of  about  80  ha;  the  urbanised  area,  presum- ably  about  the  size  of  the  mediaeval  city,  comprised  about  40 ha  (Aum\u00fcller  ( 1994)  248  fig. 1).  The  city  probably  had  an urban  layout  similar  to  that  of  other  Greek  colonies,  with open  unoccupied  spaces  (Ianelli  and  Giviglaino  ( 1989) 677\u00ad81).  The  circuit  wall  has  four  structural  phases (Aum\u00fcller  ( 1994);  Ianelli  ( 2000a)):  the  first phase (\"A\"), C 6s\u00adC5f,  had  foundations  roughly  constructed  of  boulders, possibly  supporting  a  brick  superstructure.  The  second phase  (\"B\"),  C 5s\u00adC4f,is  an  ashlar  wall  with  rectangular  tow- ers,  unusually  placed  inside  the  curtain-wall.  The  destruc- tion  and  later  enlargement  of  this  phase  is  possibly connected  with  destruction  by  Dionysios  I  in  388  and  the later  Carthagian-sponsored  refoundation  of  the  city.  Later phases  are  connected  with  the  incursions  of  the  Brettians and  possibly  with  the  wars  of  Agathokles.  The  eastern  part  of the  city,  the  Cofino plateau,  though  not  urbanised,  was  for- tified from the early history of  the  city,  but  may  have  been separated  from  the  central  area  by  a  transverse  wall,  a  sort  of diateichisma,  at  a  later  date  (Aum\u00fcller  ( 1994)  fig. 1\"a\u00ada\"and \"b\u00adb\";  cf.  also  Ianelli  and  Givigliano  ( 1989)  672\u00ad77,  679  pl. 53).  The  sanctuaries  are,  primarily,  situated  along  the  east and  north  edge  of  the  plateau,  a  system  of  \"sacra  cintura\" known,  for  instance,  from  Akragas  and  Lokroi  (Parra ( 1996b),  ( 2000)):  to  the  north  on  the  top  of  \"Belvedere- Telegrafo\"  is  a  C 6m  temenos  with  naiskoi  and  a  monumen- tal,  C 6l  peripteral  Doric  temple;  to  the  east  is  the  temenos \"Contorno  del  Castello\";  a  C 5l\u00adC4e  Ionic  temple  is  located on  the  Cofino plateau;  c. 150  north-west  of  temple  are remains  of  a  small  temenos  with  votive  deposits  and naiskos(?)  and  a  via  sacra  (Quilici  ( 1990)).  The  evidence  for the  cults  is  above  all  C 5f  pinakes  of  Lokrian  type  with Persephone\u00adKore  iconography  (cf.  Strabo  6.1.5),  though one  type  is  unique,  with  an  Aphrodite  iconography  not known from  the  Lokroi  pinakes  (Parra  ( 1989)  559\u00ad65, ( 1996b)  142\u00ad43;  Hinz  ( 1998)  211\u00ad12).  C 4  figurines indicate a Demeter  cult  (Ianelli  ( 1996c)  147).A  very  rich  votive  deposit in  \"localit\u00e0  Scrimbia\"  covers  the  period  c. 570\u00adC5  and  testi- fies t o  a  wealthy  aristocracy  (Sabbione  ( 1996);  Hinz  ( 1998) 212).  Cults  of  Zeus,  Athena  and  Hermes  seem  to  be  indicat- ed  by  the  coin  types  (infra),  as  does  one  of  a  local  nymph Pandina.  The  C 7\u00adC6  cemeteries  were  located  on  the  western outskirts  of  city,  originally  outside  the  circuit  walls,  perhaps later  within  (Arslan  ( 1986);  M.  D'Andria  ( 1989);  Ianelli ( 2000b)). Like  its  metropolis  Lokroi,  and  the  other  Lokrian  sub- colony  of  Medma,  Hipponion  did  not  issue  coins  until  C 4m, when  it  initiated  a  bronze  coinage.  The  first phase is dated before  the  Brettian  conquest  in  356  or  after,  on  the  basis  of Brettian  influence on letters in the legend  or (cf. Lombardo  ( 1989)  441\u00ad43,  who  argues  for  periods  of Hipponian  autonomy  in  C 4s\u00adC3e).  Obv.  head  of  Hermes; 262 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo rev.  eagle,  or  amphora  or  kerykeion  (Rutter,  HN \u00b32243\u00ad54; SNG  Cop.  Italy 1829\u00ad30).  Later  issues  have  obv.  head  of  Zeus, or  Apollo,  with  rev.  types  similar  to  those  of  the  earlier issues;  legend: (Rutter,  HN \u00b32246ff;  SNG Cop.  Italy 1831\u00ad34).  One  issue  depicts  a  goddess  Pandina (possibly  influenced b y  Terina:  Rutter  ( 1997)  78),  legend: (Rutter,  HN \u00b32251;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1834).  A small  issue  of  staters  on  the  Corinthian  standard  has  been attributed  to Hipponion  on  the  basis  of  the  kerykeion symbol  on  the  rev.(Rutter,  HN \u00b32242). 54.Hyele  (Hyeletes)/Elea  (Eleates) Map  46.

Antiochos  (FGrHist 555) fr. 8  apud  Strabo  6.1.1).  The  corresponding  city-ethnic  is `  (C 5  coins,  infra).  This  form  is  replaced  in  the Classical  period  by  ',  (Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 8 apud  Strabo  6.1.1;  Pl.  Soph. 216A;  Ps.-Skylax  12).  The  corre- sponding  city-ethnic  is  '  (IG iv\u00b2.1258  (C 4);  Arist. Rh. 1400b7),  also  spelled  ( ( 1987)  no. 758  (C 4)) and  possibly  in  SEG 24  303  (C 6\u00adC5)  as  re-interpreted  by  G.  Cordiano  ( 1995a). Hyele  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Hdt. 1.167.3 (where  Ros\u00e9n's  conjecture  is  preferable  to codd. );  and  \"Elea\"  is  one  of  ten  toponyms  listed  at  Ps.- Skylax 12  after  the  heading    ` , where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense.  Polites  is  found  in Speusippos  fr. 3.The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic is  found  on  C 5  coins  (infra);  the  external  collective use  is found  in  Arist.  Rh. 1400b7  and  possibly  in  SEG 24  303 (C 6\u00adC5)  as  reinterpreted  by  G.  Cordiano  ( 1995a);  and  the external  individual  use  is  found  at  IG iv\u00b2.1258  (C 4)  and  BE ( 1987)  no. 758  (C 4). Hyele  was  founded  by  Phokaians  (  Alalians  (no. 1))  who had  abandoned  the  Phokaian  colony  of  Alalia  on  Corsica shortly  after  the  battle  of  Alalia  (c. 540\u00ad535)  in  which  they had  defeated  Etruscan  and  Carthaginian  forces  but  suffered severe  losses  themselves  (Hdt. 1.166\u00ad67);  according  to Ps.-Skymnos  250,  a contingent  from  Massalia  (no. 3)  parti- cipated  in  the  foundation.  The  site  on  which  the  city  was founded  was  uninhabited  before  the  arrival  of  the  Hellenes (Bencivenga  Trillmich  ( 1990)  365). The  territory  of  Hyele  was  delimited  by  the  hills  of  Mt. Gelbison  and  Mt.  Cavallara  and  the  Classical  fortresses located  there,  such  as  that  of  Moio  della  Civitella  (E.  Greco and  Schnapp  ( 1986);  Bencivenga  Trillmich  ( 1990)  366\u00ad67 fig. 367).  The  earlier  contention  that  Hyele  had  no  chora (Pugliese  Carratelli  ( 1970b)  12\u00ad14)  has  been  abandoned  (cf. for  instance  Morel  ( 1988)  438\u00ad40);  Gras  ( 1985)  422\u00ad23  calcu- lates  the  arable  hinterland  of  Hyele  as  c. 13  km \u00b2,  suggesting that  a  large  part  of  the  chora,  above  all  the  wooded  slopes  of the  inland  hills,  was  exploited  for  timber.  E.  Greco  and Schnapp  ( 1983)  382\u00ad83  suggest  that  the  territory  within  a distance  of 4\u00ad5  km  of  Hyele  was  suitable  for  farming.  The largest  territorial  extension,  as  bounded  by  Poseidonian  territory  to  the  north,  and  at  the  Palinuros  peninsula, delimiting  the  territory  of  Pyxous  (no. 67)  on  the  south,  is c. 400\u00ad500  km \u00b2;  however,  the  degree  of  Hyele's  control  over this  larger  area  is  uncertain;  Strabo  6.1.1  hints  at  armed  conflicts w ith  Poseidonia  (no. 66)  and  the  Leukanians,  but supplies  no  date.  No  sanctuaries  or  second-order  settle- ments  are  known  in  the  territory  (Bencivenga  Trillmich ( 1990)  366). According  to  Strabo  6.1.1,  the  offshore  islands  of  the Oinotrides  offered  good  anchoring  places,  while  the  estuaries  of  the  rivers  Alento  and  Fiumarella  north  and south  of  the  acropolis  also  offered  harbour  facilities  (cf. Johannowsky  ( 1982)  234).  Apart  from  these  mercantile aspects  the  city  has  all  the  appearances  of  a  \"population- colony\"  with  a  chora  (cf.  Morel  ( 1988)  438\u00ad40,  461). Attempts  have  been  made  to  estimate  the  size  of  Hyele's population  at  the  time  of  its  foundation  from  the  number  of Phokaian  ships  that  survived  the  battle  at  Alalia:  twenty  pen- tekonteres  according  to  Hdt. 1.166.2.  A crew  of  eighty  with families  gives  a  figure of  between  240  and 320  per  ship,  in  all c. 4,800\u00ad6,400  persons  (Gras  ( 1985)  421\u00ad22);  other  calcula- tions  have  reached  a  similar  figure of  c. 6,000  (Johannowsky ( 1982)  225).  However,  it  is  important  to  bear  in  mind  that  the limited  agricultural  resources  were  not  the  sole  means  of  sup- port  for  the  population,  which  had  important  commercial contacts  as  well  (Morel  ( 1982);  Gras  ( 1985)  421\u00ad25);  cf.  also  the remarks  by  Strabo  6.1.1  on  the  city's  reliance  on  the  sea. Hyele  was  member  of  the  Italiote  League  against Dionysios  in  387  (Polyaen. 6.11).  A  squadron  of  twelve triremes  is  attested  in  Polyaen. 6.11  (r 389).  Two  citizens  of Hyele  were  involved  in  the  Timoleontic  refoundation  of Akragas  (no. 9)  (Plut.  Tim. 35.2). There  are  few  sources  for  the  political  organisation  of Hyele;  but  a  C 5f  tyranny  is  reported  by  Diod. 10.18.1\u00ad2  and Diog.  Laert. 9.26.  Parmenides  was  allegedly  the  legislator  at Hyele,  his  native  city,  and  each  year  the  archai  had  to exact  an oath  from  the  politai  to  the  effect  that  they  would  observe the  laws  of  Parmenides  (Plut.  Mor. 1126A/B;  Diog.  Laert. 9.23;  Talamo  ( 1989)).  The  earliest  preserved  public  enact- ment  is  a  242  asylia  decree  for  Kos  (IGDGG  no. 59). italia  and  kampania  263", "Pyxous": "Identifier: 68. , Map 46.  Lat. 40.05,long.  15.30.

Byz. 540.8,  possibly  derived  from  Hekataios,  may refer  to Pyxous  or,  more  likely,  to  another  site  (it  is  described as  \u00b5  ).A city-ethnic is not attest- ed  apart  from  the  entries  in  Steph.  Byz.  ( 540.8,  10). No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Pyxous  a  polis,  but  it  is included  as  a  type  B  here  on  account  of  the  following  evi- dence:  (a)  Diod. 11.59.4,  where  it  is  reported  that  it  was founded  as  a  polis  in 471/0  by  Mikythos,  the  tyrant  of Rhegion  (no. 68)  and  Zankle/Messana  (no. 51);  it  may  have been  founded  as  a  military  outpost  (Johannowsky  ( 1992)), but  the  classification suggested b y  Diodorus  may  well  be correct;  (b)  the  C 6s  incuse  coins  (staters  and  a  single  speci- men  of  a  third-stater)  on  the  Achaian  standard  depicting  the italia  and  kampania  289 Sybarite  bull  and  inscribed  obv. ,  ,  rev. ,  (Gorini  ( 1975)  9;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  1722,  1727; SNG  Cop.  Italy 1387;  SNG  Cop.  Suppl. 53).  These  coins  may have  been  struck  by  Pyxous  under  the  aegis  of  Sybaris  (cf. Parise  ( 1972)  102\u00ad4)  and  another  community,  presumably Siris  (no. 69)  or  a  community,  Sirinos(?),  in  the  vicinity  of Pyxous  (no. 67).  The  issue  has  been  subdivided  into  either four  series  (Libero  Mangieri  ( 1981))  or  two  series  (Sternberg ( 1980);  cf.  also  Moscati  Castelnuovo  ( 1989)  94\u00ad100;Rutter, HN \u00b3  p. 143).  If  the  coins  were  so  minted,  it  follows  that Pyxous  existed  prior  to  Mikythos'  foundation  of  the  site, and  that  the  community  was  able  to  enter  into  close  rela- tions  with  Siris(?)  and  Sybaris  (no. 70),of  which  latter  it  may have been  a  dependency.  What  is  less  clear,  however,  is whether  Pyxous  can  be  considered  a  Hellenic  community prior  to  Mikythos'  foundation. If  Pyxous  as  founded  by  Mikythos  was  indeed  a  polis,it may  have  been  a  failure,  for  Strabo  6.1.1  reports  that  it  was left  by  the  settlers     though  he  does  not  specify a  date  for  the  depopulation;  Pyxous  does  not  appear  in  Ps.- Skylax,  pointing  to C 4m  as  a  terminus  ante  quem.  The  C 5m indigenous  settlement  at  Roccagloriosa  7  km  from  Pyxous (Gualtieri  ( 1993))  has  been  interpreted  as  a  Leukanian replacement  of  Pyxous.  According  to Cordiano  ( 1995a),  a new  reading  of  the  Olympia  inscription  SEG 24  103,previ- ously  thought  to  refer  to  a  conflict between Rhegion and Gela,  should  rather  be  taken  as  evidence  of  conflicts between Hyele  and  Rhegion,  perhaps  brought  about  by  Rhegian expansion  and  the  foundation  of  Pyxous  by  Mikythos.  The extent  of  Pyxous'  territory is  uncertain;  prior  to the  defeat  of Sybaris  by  Kroton,  Pyxous  would  hardly  have  been autonomous,  but  rather  part  of  the  dominion  of  Sybaris;  as founded  by  Mikythos,  it  may  have  been  a  dependency  of Rhegion. The  site  of  ancient  Pyxous  is  almost  certainly  to  be  ident- ified w ith  Roman  Buxentum,  mediaeval  and  present-day Policastro,  located  on  a  knoll  on  the  left  bank  of  the  river Policastro  on  the  Gulf  of  Laos  (Talaos  Kolpos)  (Bencivenga Trillmich  ( 1988)  fig. 1).Recent  excavations  have  revealed  two phases  of  the  circuit  wall  of  the  Greek  settlement  incor- porated  in  the  mediaeval  walls:  a  C 5f  phase  constructed  in ashlar  with  upper  structures  in  sun-dried  brick  and  a  C 4l phase  in  a  polygonal  technique.  The  walls  enclosed  an  area of  about  11  ha,  of  which  perhaps  only  about  6  ha  was  used  for habitation.  There  are  no  other  structural  remains  from  the Greek  phase;  there  is  evidence  of  cult  activity  in  the  form  of fragments  of  C 5\u00adC4  votive  figurines.  The  C 5f  phase  corres- ponds  well  with  the  tradition  of  the  foundation  of  Pyxous  by Mikythos.  However,  if  Bencivenga  Trillmich  ( 1988)  is  right in  maintaining  that  there  is  no  material  of  an  earlier  period, the  site  did  not  have  an  earlier  indigenous  or  Greek  history and  cannot  therefore  have  issued  the  C 6l  coins  discussed above  (for  a  different  view,  see  Johannowsky  ( 1992)). 68. ", "Metapontion": "Identifier: 62. , (Metapontinos) Map  45.  Lat. 40.25, long. 16.50.  Size  of  territory: 4.  Type:  A.  The  toponym  is ,  (Bacchyl. 11.116,  Maehler;  Hdt. 4.15.1; Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 12;C5l  coins,  infra);  Antiochos (FGrHist 555)  fr. 12  gives  as  an  earlier  name.  The city-ethnic  is  (Hdt. 4.15.1\u00ad3;  Thuc. 7.33.5). Metapontion  is  called  a  polis  in  primarily  the  territorial sense,  with  the  urban  sense  as  a  connotation  (Antiochos (FGrHist 555)  fr. 12).  It  is  listed  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at Ps.-Skylax 14,  where  Metapontion  is  the  second  toponym listed  after  the  heading    .At Bacchyl.11.114, M\u00e4hler,  polis  presumably  refers  to legendary  times  (infra). Asty  is  found  in  Bacchyl. 11.12,  Maehler.  The  internal  collec- tive  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  abbreviated  as on  C 6s  coins  (Rutter  ( 1997)  28);  the external  collective use  is  attested  in  Hdt. 4.15.2\u00ad3  and  Thuc. 7.33.5;  and  the  external  individual  use  in  IG i\u00b3  1007 ( 500\u00ad475),  Syll. \u00b325  (C 5m)  and  Arist.  Metaph. 984a7. Metapontion  was,  according  to Antiochos  (FGrHist 555) fr. 12,  founded  by  Achaians  (cf.  Ps.-Skymnos  326ff)  who  had been  sent  for  by  the  Achaian  Sybarites  (no. 70.I)  who  want- ed  support  against  Taras  (no. 71).  Euseb.  Chron.  Arm.  under Ol. 1  dates  the  foundation  to  733/2,  but  the  archaeological evidence  suggests  a  foundation  c. 630  (infra).  The  founda- tion  legend  was  that  the  site  had  previously  been  occupied by  a  Greek  city  founded  by  Nestor  and  the  Pylians  on  their return  from  Troy  but  later  destroyed  by  the  Samnitai (Strabo  6.1.15);  in,  e.g.,  Bacchyl.  Ep. 11.114,  M\u00e4hler,  Achaioi should  probably  be  understood  in  the  Homeric  sense  as referring  to  this  mythical  foundation  (Pugliese  Carratelli ( 1973)  51).According  to  Ephor.  fr. 141,the  oecist  was  Daulios, the  tyrant  of  Krisa;  according  to  Strabo  6.1.15,  it  was Leukippos  of  Achaia,  and  this  seems  to  have  been  the  epi- choric  tradition,  since  his  head  is  on  some  C 4s  coins  (Head, HN \u00b278;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  1552\u00ad53,  etc.).  The  historicity  of  this tradition,  however,  is  rendered  suspect  by  Dion.  Hal.  Ant. Rom. 19.3,  where  the  trick  by  which  Leukippos  obtained  the site  for  his  foundation  is  associated  with  Kallipolis  (Morgan and  Hall  ( 1996)  211;  see  also  Mele  ( 1996)). The  territory  is  termed  at  Hdt. 4.15.2;Strabo 6.1.4 names  it  ,  possibly  deriving  the  name  from Antiochos  (FGrHist 555,fr.  3a);  it  is  the  area  confined b y  the valleys  of  the  rivers  Cavone  and  Bradano,  calculated  to  com- prise  about  200  km \u00b2.The  limit  of  the  chora  was  inland  about italia  and  kampania  279 13  km  from  Metapontion  at  the  border  fortress  at  Cozzo Presepe  (Osanna  ( 1992)  54,  82).  The  area  of  influence may have  been  more  extensive  from  C 6m  (Osanna  ( 1992)  53\u00ad54), when  the  territory  of  Siris  (no. 69)  was  taken  over  by  the Achaian  alliance  of  Metapontion  (no. 61),  Sybaris  (no. 70.I) and  Kroton  (no. 56)  (Just.  Epit. 20.2.4).  The  chora  of Metapontion  is  above  all  known  for  the  agrarian  land  divi- sion  and  scattered  farmsteads,  in  evidence  from  C 6s  to  C 4, over  an  area  of  c. 20,000  ha  (Carter  ( 1990),  ( 1993),  ( 2000)). Sanctuaries  are  attested  in  the  chora  of  Metapontion  from C 7m-l.  An  Artemision  (?)  is  documented  at  San  Biagio  (cf. votives  and  Bacchyl. 11.117,  M\u00e4hler;  Arena  ( 1996)  no. 64).  A sanctuary  of  Hera,  epigraphically  attested  (Arena  ( 1996)  no. 75),  on  the  border  of  Tarantine  territory  has  votive  material going  back  to  C 7m;  the  temple  (\"Tavola  Palatine\")  is  dated c. 530.  From  C 6  a  number  of  spring  sanctuaries  were  spread regularly  across  the  territory,  probably  spaced  according  to the  land  division  of  the  chora.  The  most  important  are  at Incoronata,  San  Biagio  and  Pantanello  (Osanna  ( 1992)  40, 50,  54).  The  outermost  border  sanctuary  at  the  site  of  Cozzo Presepe  was  monumentalised  C 5  (Carter  ( 1994)). A  war  (possibly  C 5m:  Morgan  and  Hall  ( 1996)  210)  with Taras  (no. 71)  concerning  control  of  territory  is  attested  by Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 12. On  the  basis  of  the  seating  capacity  of  the  ekklesiasterion (infra),  the  total  population  of  the  polis  may  tentatively  be  estimated  at  max. 40,000,  of  whom  some 12,500  could be  accommodated  in  the  town  itself  (Carter  ( 1990)  406  with n. 2). Metapontion  may  have  been  a  member  of  the  Italiote League  (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 230).  An  alliance  with  Sybaris  (no. 70.I)  and  Kroton  (no. 56)  in  a  C 6f  war  against  Siris  (no. 69)  is reported  by  Just.  Epit. 20.2.3\u00ad4.  In  C 5s,  Metapontion  was, with  Taras  (no. 71)  and  Kaulonia  (no. 55),  involved  in  arbitra- tion  between  Kroton  and  returning  exiles  (Iambl.  VP 262).  A treaty  of  symmachia  with  Athens  (no. 361)  is  attested  in  Thuc. 7.33.5.  Naval  forces  and  akontistai  are  attested  at  Thuc. 7.33.5. Reception  of  envoys  in  C 4f  is  attested  in  Polyaen. 5.2.22. Two  citizens  of  Metapontion  are  listed  as  proxenoi  of  the Aitolian  Confederacy  in  IG ix\u00b2  1.17.A.ii.74\u00ad75  (c. 260\u00ad230).A citizen  of  Metapontion  served  as  theorodokos  of  Epidauros (no. 348)  in  356/5  (IG iv\u00b2.195.49). Sources  for  the  political  organisation  of  Metapontion  are scanty,  though  there  is  some  tenuous  evidence  of  a  tyranny by  Archelaos  at  Metapontion  in  the  Archaic  period  (Berve ( 1967)  610\u00ad11;  Luraghi  ( 1994)  76  with  refs.;  for  archaeolog- ical  evidence  possibly  supporting  the  tradition  of  Archelaos' murder,  see De Siena  ( 1999)  234\u00ad35).  An  aristocratic  or  oligarchic  regime  at  Metapontion  may  perhaps  be  inferred from  the  story  that  Pythagoras  took  refuge  at  Metapontion, where  he  died  (Aristox.  fr. 18,  Wehrli).  According  to  Thuc. 7.57.11,  the  Metapontines  supported  Athens  against Syracuse  in  413  because  internal  conflicts ( stasiotikoi  kairoi) left  them  no  other  choice  (cf.  HCT  ad  loc.);  this  may  mean that  in  413  democrats  were  in  the  ascendancy  (Berger  ( 1992) 28),  and  democracy  may  also  be  implied  by  the  symmachia with  Athens  mentioned  at  Thuc. 7.34.4.  For  a  possible  attes- tation  of  an  eponymous  official (rendered in Oscan as med- dix)  in  C 4e,  see  Tagliamonte  ( 1994)  167\u00ad68.A board of officials called  is  mentioned  in  Hesych.  s.v.  A private  dedication  of  C 4\u00adC3e  describes  the  female  dedicator as  [--]  .  ,  where .  is  interpreted  as  an \"abbreviation  of  a  deme  or  phyle,  referring  to the  father  of the  dedicator  \"(SEG  38  997  comm.). Metapontion  was  founded  on  a  low  plateau  near  the  coast between  the  rivers  Basento  and  Bradano.  C 7e  evidence  has revealed  a  mixed  pre-colonial  Greek  (Ionic?)  and  indigen- ous  settlement(s)  (cf.  De  Siena  ( 1986)),  whereas  the  Achaian foundation  can  be  dated  to  c. 630  (Adamesteanu  ( 1982) 309\u00ad13).  A  C 6m  circuit  wall  with  extensive  use  of  sun-dried brick  was  raised  on  the  edge  of  the  settlement  plateau enclosing  an  area  of 140\u00ad45  ha.  C 5  saw  some  restructuring, and  C 4\u00adC3  a  strengthening  with  use  of  ashlar  and  reused blocks  from  older  buildings,  and  a  systematisation  of drainage  canals  and  city  gates  (Adamesteanu  ( 1973b) 156\u00ad68).  A  sizeable  agora  (cf.  Hdt. 4.15.4),  delimiting  the southern  side  of  the  large  temenos,  was  part  of  the  urban  lay- out  from  its  earliest  phase.  The  main  public  monument  is the  ekklesiasterion/theatre,  with  a  history  spanning  C 7\u00adC3. The  seating  capacity  of  the  C 5e  structure  has  been  calculat- ed  at  about  7,500\u00ad8,000  (Mertens  and  De  Siena  ( 1982)).  The interpretation  of  the  structure  as  an  ekklesiasterion  is  sup- ported  by  the  related,  circular  meeting  places  in  Akragas  and in  Poseidonia  (Hansen  and  Fischer-Hansen  ( 1994)  65\u00ad67). The  monumental  size  and  the  apparently  excessive  seating capacity  imply  a  use  also  outside  the  purely  political  sphere (Mertens  ( 1982);  Carter  ( 1994)  182).  The  ekklesiasterion  was replaced  C 4\u00adC3  by  a  theatre  with  a  seating  capacity  of c. 6,500  (Paus. 6.19.12;  Mertens  and  De  Siena  ( 1982)).  A  Zeus Agoraios  cult  is  attested  by  a  C 6f  inscribed  stele  found  near the  theatre  (Adamesteanu  ( 1979);  the  inscription  may  refer to  the  function  of  the  ekklesiasterion  and  not  to the  agora  as such,  according  to  E.  Greco  ( 1995b)  89\u00ad90).  Other  sanctuar- ies  are  evidenced  by  walled  enclosures,  the  larger  with  two altars,  perhaps  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo  mentioned  by Herodotos  ( 4.15);  C 5  coins  depicting  Apollo  testify  to  the 280 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo importance  of  his  cult  (Stazio  ( 1973)  83\u00ad84).  For  the  manti- neion  of  Apollo,  cf.  Theopomp.  fr. 248. There  is  numismatic  evidence  of  athletic  games  at Metapontion:  the  first C 5m  series  of  Metapontine  double- relief  issues  has  as  rev.  type  a  standing  figure of  Acheloos, naked  and  pouring  a  libation,  accompanied  by  the  legend    (infra). The  major  urban  temenos  between  the  agora  and  the habitation  area  was  laid  out  on  vast  dimensions  at  the  time of  foundation  or  shortly  after;  later  it  comprised  four  major temples  and  several  minor  temples  or  shrines;  by  C 4  it  was delimited  from  the  agora  by  a  fence-like  structure,  from  the kerameikos  by  a  drainage  canal,  and  from  the  habitation zone  by  a  stoa-like  building  (Mertens  ( 1985)).It  was  dedicat- ed  to  Athena  (Adamesteanu  ( 1976)  163);  an  Archaic  cippus has  the  epiklesis  [Hy]gi[e]ias  or  [Ai]gi[d]ias  (Arena  ( 1996) no. 68;see Graf  ( 1981)  171,  suggesting  a  cult  of  Athena Polias).  To  Apollo  Lykeios  was  dedicated  the  C 6e  \"Peripteral temple  A 1\",  whence  comes  rich  C 6e  votive  material (Adamesteanu  ( 1970);  Arena  ( 1996)  nos. 56,  57,  58).  For Apollo  Lykeios  Nikaios,  possibly  referring  to a  victory  over Siris  (no. 69)  in  530,  see  Adamesteanu  ( 1970)  319  and  Arena ( 1996)  no. 60.  Stones  shaped  as  anchors  may  reflect a cult of Apollo  Archegetes  (Adamesteanu  ( 1974)  28).  It  is  not  known to  which  deity  the  C 6m  \"Peripteral  temple  B 1\"  was  dedicat- ed  (Adamesteanu  ( 1970)  319\u00ad20;Graf  ( 1981)  170\u00ad71,  174  n. 61).  The  temple  was  reconstructed  c. 540  (  \"Peripteral  tem- ple  B 2\";  Adamesteanu  ( 1974)  27;  Mertens  ( 1985)  658).  The \"Peripteral  temple  A 2\"  was  constructed  c. 540,  but  the  dedi- catee  deity  is  unknown.  \"Oikos  C 2\"  c. 500  replaces  an  earlier shrine.  C 6l\u00adC5e  witnessed  a  monumentalisation  of  the sanctuary  with  the  C 5f  \"Temple  D\"  (Mertens  ( 1985)  661\u00ad63), where  the  cult  is  again  unknown.  In  addition  to  Apollo, votives  and  various  inscriptions  mention  Athena,  Hera, Aphrodite,  Artemis  and  Hermes  (cf.  Graf  ( 1981)  171),  and  a C 5  cult  of  Demeter  is  possibly  attested  as  well  (Hinz  ( 1998) 217).  For  urban  cults  add  Zeus  Agoraios:  Adamesteanu ( 1979);  Arena  ( 1996)  no. 59  (C 6f).  For  the   '~  cip- pus  and  the  reading  \"Zeus  Aglaios\",  cf.  Bottini  ( 1989)  565\u00ad66. C 5  coin  types  and  votive  deposits  add  further  evidence  of the  cult  of  Apollo,  Apollo  Karneios,  Demeter,  Zeus  Ammon, Athena,  Hermes,  Dionysos  and  Herakles  (Stazio  ( 1973) 84\u00ad86),  but  also  of  a  number  of  lesser  divinities  and,  in  C 4s, the  cult  of  the  hero/oikistes  Leukippos  (Lacroix  ( 1965) 85\u00ad89).  Further  epigraphic  evidence:  C 5  sherds  with  graffiti naming  Athene  (Hygieia?)  (Arena  ( 1996)  no. 68  (C 5f)); Aphrodite  (Arena  ( 1996)  nos. 73  (C 6l)  and  74  (C 5e));  for  an inscription  naming  Hermes,  see  Adamesteanu  ( 1975a)  252. Monumental  drains  delimiting  the  agora,  kerameikos  and temenos  are  probably  C 4;  however,  the  morphology  of  the terrain  presupposes  a  system  of  drainage  at  least  from  the C 6m  (cf.  Adamesteanu  ( 1975a)  247\u00ad48,  251\u00ad52).  The  overall layout  and  the  delimitation  of  public  spaces  were  in  place  by C 7s,  but  the  basic  elements  of  the  orthogonal  town plan  are C 6m.The  degree  of  development  of  the  individual  insulae  is not  clarified,  but  a  gradual  development,  as  known from most  other  sites,  is  probable  (Adamesteanu  ( 1973)  168\u00ad77, ( 1982)  309\u00ad11;  Mertens  ( 1982)  104\u00ad7).  The  kerameikos  dates back  to C 6m  (F.  D'Andria  ( 1975)).  About  325  burials  have been  investigated  at  Pantanello,  c. 3  km  north  of  the  city.  C 6e Greek  burials,  probably  those  of  the  first settlers in the chora, took  over  the  originally  indigenous  burial  place;  from  C 6l the  number  of  burials  increased  significantly,  and  the  ceme- tery  continued  in  use  until  C 4  (Prohaszka  ( 1995);  Carter ( 1998)  167ff,  236ff).  The  Crucina  cemetery,  just  outside  the city  wall,  contained  about  600  burials,  including  early,  mon- umental  chamber  tombs,  possibly  also  that  of  the  tyrant Antileon  (Carter  ( 1998)  8,  26;  De  Siena  ( 1999)  233\u00ad35;  for  the topography  of  the  cemeteries  of  Metapontion,  see  Lo  Porto ( 1966)  183\u00ad231). Communal  consultation  of  the  Delphic  oracle  is  attested by  Hdt. 4.15.3.Bacchyl.11,M\u00e4hler,celebrates  a  Pythian  victo- ry  by  Alexidamos  in  boys'  wrestling.  Metapontion  had  a treasury  at  Olympia  (Paus. 6.19.11;  cf.  Polemo  fr. 20,  Pr.). Architectural  remains  at  Olympia  and  at  Delphi  have  been attributed  to  Metapontian  thesauroi  (Mertens-Horn  and Viola  ( 1990)  245\u00ad46).An  image  of  Zeus  was  dedicated  by  the people  of  Metapontion  at  Olympia  (Paus. 5.22.5)  but  cannot be  dated.  The  famous  golden  harvest  dedicated  by  the  Pylian founders  at  Delphi  according  to  Strabo  6.1.15  (cf.  Courby ( 1927)  268;  Lacroix  ( 1965)  154\u00ad58)  has  been  taken  as  evidence of  a  Metapontine  communal  dedication  (Vatin  ( 1991)  55\u00ad56, whose  readings,  however,  must  be  treated  with  great  cau- tion). The  coinage  of  Metapontion  began  c. 550,  with  silver staters  in  the  incuse  fabric  on  the  Achaian  standard;  the  type is  an  ear  of  barley,  though  some  issues  carry  secondary  sym- bols  such  as  a  grasshopper  or  a  dolphin,  and  on  later  issues: ram's  head,  mule's  head  and  lizard.  Legends  are  , ,  at  times  retrograde  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  1459; SNG  Cop.  Italy 1158\u00ad73;  for  the  mint,  see  Stazio  ( 1973);  Noe and  Johnston  ( 1984);  Johnston  ( 1990)).  The  staters  were struck  in  three  phases  on  broad,  medium  and  dumpy  flans; smaller  denominations  were struck  in  a  complex  system which  provides  transitional  issues  between  incuse  and  dou- ble-relief  fabrics:  drachms,  triobols,  diobols,  obols  and  a italia  and  kampania  281 quarter-stater:  types:  obv.  and  rev.  barley  grain,  sometimes with  revs.  ox-head,  or  head  of  man-faced  bull  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3 1487,  1492;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1174\u00ad81,  Suppl. 42).  Double-relief coinage  was  introduced  c.C 5m;  staters:  obv.  ear  of  barley; rev.  five  barley  grains  forming  a  star,  legends: , on  obv.  and  rev.  respectively  (Rutter,  HN \u00b31490; SNG  Cop.  Italy 1182),  followed  by  issues  with  obv.  types  and legends  as  above,  but  with  divinities  as  rev.  types  (cf.  Stazio ( 1973)  80\u00ad85  for  interpretations  of  these):  (a)  river-god Acheloos,  legend     (Noe  and Johnston  ( 1984)  56\u00ad57,  90;Rutter,  HN \u00b31491;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1183  (late));  (b)  Apollo  holding  branch  and  bow  (Rutter, HN \u00b31496;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1185);  (c)  Herakles  with  club  over shoulder  (Rutter,  HN \u00b31495;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1184),  or Herakles  sacrificing at altar (Rutter,  HN \u00b31494;  Noe  and Johnston  ( 1984)  no. 312).  Diobols  have  obv.  as  above,  rev. head  of  Acheloos  (Rutter,  HN \u00b31492;  SNG  Cop.  Suppl. 42).  A new  C 5l  issue  of  staters  has  as  obv.  types  heads  of  divinities (Rutter,  HN \u00b31505ff):  Apollo  Karneios  (or  Hermes Parammon  or  Zeus  Ammon),  Apollo,  Zeus  (at  times  with epithet ),  Dionysos,  Demeter,  and  per- sonifications such as H omonoia,  Nike,  Hygieia  and  Soteria identified b y  epithets;  rev.  ear  of  barley,  legends  as  above  and ,  (SNG  Cop. Italy 1186\u00ad1207;  Noe  and  Johnston  ( 1984)  nos. 481,  495, 523\u00ad24  for  full  toponym  and  ethnic).  Some  dies  were  signed, some  unusually  with  the  name  Aristoxenos  in  full  (Stazio ( 1973)  87;  Noe  and  Johnston  ( 1984)  62\u00ad65).  Lower  denomi- nations  C 5l  have  obv.  ear  of  barley;  rev.  crescents  and  pellets (Rutter,  HN \u00b31498\u00ad99;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1230);  later,  from  last quarter  of  C 4  obvs.  with  divinities  as  above  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3 1594ff;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1231\u00ad38).  Bronze  coins  were  intro- duced  C 5s  (Johnston  ( 1989)):  obv.  tripod,  legend: ; rev.  ear  of  barley  (Rutter,  HN \u00b31637;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1250, 1270);  C 4f  issues  have  obv.  Hermes  sacrificing o ver  thymia- terion;  rev.  ear  of  barley,  legend  and  an  unusual  ident- ification of  denomination, (Rutter,  HN \u00b31639; SNG  Cop.  Italy 1242);  also  bronze  coins  with  obv.  head  of Nike or Demeter,  rev.  ear  of  barley  and  ithyphallic  herm (Rutter,  HN \u00b31641;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1243).  In  C 4m  more  silver issues  were  struck,  depicting  heads  of  divinities  and  person- ifications as above ( Johnston  ( 1990);  Rutter,  HN \u00b3  1554ff; SNG  Cop.  Italy 1218\u00ad29).  A  reference  to the  origin  of  the  city is  found  in  an  issue  of  staters  and  gold  coinage  with  the  head of  Leukippos  (Lacroix  ( 1965)  85\u00ad86;  Stazio  ( 1973)  89\u00ad91; Rutter,  HN \u00b3  1552;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1208\u00ad17).  Gold  tetrobols were  struck  from  c. 340\u00ad330,  perhaps  at  the  time  of Alexander  the  Molossian  to  pay  mercenaries:  obv.  head  of Leukippos,  or  of  Nike,  legend  (Stazio  ( 1973) 91\u00ad92;  Johnston  ( 1990)  41\u00ad45;Rutter,  HN \u00b31629;  SNG  Cop. Suppl. 43). 62. ", "Terina": "Identifier: 74. , (Terinaios) Map  46.  Lat. 38.55,long.  16.15.Still unlocated  (Spadea  ( 1979);  cf.  Spadea  ( 1990a))  though  most often  located  at  S.  Eufemia  Lamezia  (thus  Barr.  with  query). Size  of  territory:  ?  Type:  [A].  The  toponym  is  (IG iv\u00b2.195.45  ( 356/5);  Ps.-Skylax  12),  or  (Lycoph.  Alex. 726;  Ps.-Skymnos  306).  The  city-ethnic  is  (C 5l coins,  infra;  IG ii\u00b2  10438  (C 4m))  or  ([Plut.]  X orat. 845C  (rC 4s)). Terina  is  one  of  ten  toponyms  listed  at  Ps.-Skylax  12  after the  heading    ` ,  where polis  is used  in  the  urban  sense  (cf.  Polyaen. 2.10.1  (rC 5s);  Diod. 16.15.2  (r 356/5)).  The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city- ethnic  is  found  on  C 5  coins  (infra);  the  external  collective use  is  found  in  Polyaen. 2.10.1  (rC 5s);  the  external  individual use  is  found  in  IG ii\u00b2  10438  (C 4m)  and  [Plut.]  X  orat. 845C (rC 4s). Terina  was  founded  by  Kroton  (no. 56)  (Ps.-Skymnos 306\u00ad7;  Phlegon  (FGrHist 257)  fr. 31);  the  date  of  foundation is  unknown,  and  the  terminus  ante  quem  is  c. 460,  the  date  at which  the  city  began  issuing  coins  (Rutter  ( 1997)  61).  Terina may  have been  founded  after  the  Krotoniate  defeat  of Sybaris  c. 510  (De  Sensi  Sestito  ( 1985)  199\u00ad200);  if  the  foun- dation  was  earlier,  it  probably  antedated  the  C 7\u00adC6f Lokrian  foundations  of  Hipponion  (no. 53)  and  Medma (no. 60)  (Spadea  ( 1979);  Giangiulio  ( 1989)  233\u00ad38).  After c. 510,  Sybaritan  influence in the area was r eplaced  by Krotoniate  influence,  as  demonstrated  by  coin  hoards  (De Sensi  Sestito  ( 1985)). A  war  with  Thourioi  (no. 74)  is  attested  a  few  years  after 444/3  (Polyaen. 2.10.1).  Terina  was  besieged  and  taken  by  the Brettians  in  356  (Diod. 16.15.2),  and  the  city  became  a Brettian  community,  surviving  the  conquest  of  Alexander the  Molossian  c. 325  (Livy  8.24.4). italia  and  kampania  303 A  citizen  of  Terina  served  as  theorodokos  of  Epidauros (no. 348)  in  356/5  (IG iv\u00b2.195.45).  An  inscribed  bronze plaque  (of  C 4  or  later)  found  near  S.  Eufemia  Lamezia  has been  tentatively  attributed  to  Terina  (IGSII  no. 21);  in  l. 10  it mentions  a  ,  an  office known also  from  Kroton (Ath. 522C  (rC 5e)).The  same  inscription  possibly  attests  the existence  of  a  system  of  civic  subdivisions  of  a  territorial  disposition  (Jones,  POAG 167\u00ad68).  Terina  was  presumably fortified in  356/5  when  it  was  besieged  by  the  Brettians ( :Diod.  16.15.2). C 5\u00adC4  (infra)  coins  attest  to  cults  of  the  eponymous nymph  and  Nike,  who  seem  to  have  become  assimilated (Lacroix  ( 1965)  126;  Rutter  ( 1997)  61\u00ad62).  A  cult  of  the  local nymph  Pandina  may  be  indicated  by  C 4  bronze  issues,  per- haps  reflecting the influence  of  Hipponion  (Giannelli  ( 1963) 171\u00ad74). In  all  probability,  a  citizen  of  Terina  was  victorious  at Olympia  in  392:  the  victor's  full  name  has  been  corrupted, but  Africanus  gives  as  his  first name,  and  the  vic- tor  was  thus  probably  from  Terina  (see  Olympionikai 376). Terina  commenced  minting  c. 460;  c. 460\u00ad440  there  are three  main  issues  of  staters  and  fractions  on  the  Achaian standard:  (a)  staters:  obv.  head  of  river-nymph  Terina,  leg- end: ;  rev.  standing  wingless  Nike  holding branch,  legend: ,  within  an  olive  wreath  (Holloway and  Jenkins  ( 1983)  no. 1;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  2567);  (b)  staters:  obv. as  above,  but  later  style;  rev.  standing  winged  Nike  with branch  and  wreath  (Holloway  and  Jenkins  ( 1983)  nos. 2\u00ad3; Rutter,  HN \u00b3  2568);  (c)  staters:  similar  types,  but  Nike  on  rev. has  raised  arms  (Holloway  and  Jenkins  ( 1983)  no. 4;Rutter, HN \u00b3  2569;  SNG  Cop.

Rom. 15.5\u00ad6  (rC 4s). Neapolis  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  (Ps.-Skylax 10),  whereas  the  sources  for  polis  used  in  the  political  sense are  late  (SEG 12  378.6  ( 242);  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 15.5.1,  6.5 (rC 4s)).  The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is found  on  C 5l  coins  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3557);  the  external  collective use  is  found  in  Timaios  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 98  and  Dion.  Hal. Ant.  Rom. 15.6.4  (rC 4s);  and  the  external  individual  use  in Diod. 16.18.1  (r 356). Neapolis  was  founded  c. 470  on  the  initiative  of  Kyme  (no. 57;  Ps.-Skymnos  242\u00ad43;  cf.  Strabo  5.4.7);  the  date  is  based on  the  chronology  of  Syracusan  involvement  in  Kymaian history  and  upon  evidence  from  the  Castel  Capuano  ceme- tery  (Frederiksen  ( 1984)  94,  101\u00ad7;  Valenza  Mele  ( 1993) 197\u00ad98).  The  city  was  subsequently  settled  also  by Chalkidians  (no. 365),  Pithekoussaians  (no. 65)  and Athenians  (no. 361),  taking  its  name  \"Neapolis\"  only  at  this time  (Strabo  5.4.7;  cf.  Lomas  ( 2000)  174).  Euboian  involve- ment  in  the  foundation,  via  Kyme  or  Chalkis,  is  supported by  evidence  from  the  calendar  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 42\u00ad43). Exactly  how  these  later  arrivals  merged  with  the  earlier Kymaian  foundation  is  uncertain  (Raviola  ( 1991)  20\u00ad23). Neapolis  had  a  C 7  predecessor,  Parthenope,  but  the  relationship  between  the  two  settlements  is  not  wholly  clarified.  Parthenope  ( :Strabo 14.2.10;  ethnic :  Steph.  Byz. 504.7)  is  called  a  polis  in  a  late source  (Steph.  Byz. 504.6),but  its  polis  status  is  highly  uncer- tain.  Parthenope  was  probably  originally  an  epineion  of Kyme,  comparable  with  the  settlement  of  Dikaiarcheia  (see entry  in  list  of  non-polis  sites  supra).  The  identification of Parthenope  on  the  hill  of  Pizzofalcone,  adjoining  the  later settlement  of  Neapolis,  is  based  upon  evidence  from  its cemetery  with  tombs  dating  to  675\u00ad550,  implying  that Parthenope  became  the  district  of  Palaiopolis  when  Kyme founded  neighbouring  Neapolis  in  C 5f,  with  an  as  yet  unex- plained  hiatus  in  the  chronology  of  the  early  and  later  settle- ment  (cf.  Raviola  ( 1990)  19).  The  more  consistent  tradition is  that  Parthenope  was  either  an  apoikia  or  an  epineion  of Kyme,  and  that  the  site  was  later  destroyed  by  its  metropolis (Lutatius  apud  Serv.  auct.  ad  Verg,  G. 4.563  fr. 7,Peter; sources:  B\u00e9rard  ( 1957)  56;  Raviola  ( 1990));  but  the  sources also  seem  to  suggest  that  the  settlement  was  autonomous during  its  early  history  and  not  just  an  early  stage  of  the  later Neapolis  (summary  of  evidence:  Raviola  ( 1990)  59\u00ad60). By C 4s  the  two  distinct,  neighbouring  urban  nuclei, Parthenope  (  Palaiopolis)  and  Neapolis,  formed  one political  community  (Livy  8.22.5),  suggesting  the  absorp- tion  of  the  earlier  site  by  the  later  settlement  of  Neapolis  (cf. Lomas  ( 2000)  174;  see  further  Parthenope  in  list  of  non-polis sites  supra). Neapolis  was  founded  within  the  Kymaian  dominion  (cf. Strabo  5.4.7).  Its  territory  was  not  extensive:  c. 20  km \u00b2 (Lepore  ( 1967)  142,  146\u00ad48).  The  city  was  a  maritime  settle- ment  and  had  a  narrow  chora  bounded  by  a  number  of Oscan  sites  situated  not  far  inland  (Polyb. 3.91.4).  The  city was  separated  from  its  hinterland  by  the  river  Clanis.  Apart from  the  uncertain  evidence  of  a  sanctuary  of  Athena  at Sorrento  (Surrento)  (Strabo  5.4.8),  perhaps  reflected in the numismatic  evidence  (Rutter  ( 1979)  94\u00ad95),  extra-urban  or suburban  sanctuaries  are  not  attested.  The  Demeter  sanctu- ary  of  the  \"Convento  di  S.  Gaudioso\"  within  the  urban  area of  Neapolis  had  an  Archaic  pre-foundation  phase  and  is therefore  interpreted  as  situated  in  the  chora  of  Kyme  prior to  the  foundation  of  Neapolis,  perhaps  demarcating  the italia  and  kampania  283 southern  limit  of  the  territory  of  Kyme  (E.  Greco  ( 1985a) 188\u00ad89).  At some  point  after  the  Hieronian  teichos  on Pithekoussai  had  been  abandoned,  Neapolis  assumed  con- trol  of  the  island  (Strabo  5.4.9). Neapolis  may  have  obtained  some  understanding  with Rome  as  a  bulwark  against  Dionysios  of  Syracuse  (Timaios (FGrHist 566)  fr. 32;  but  see  Jacoby,  comm.  ad  loc.);  in  327  the city  entered  into  a  foedus  aequum  with  Rome  (Livy  8.26.6; Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 410).  An  alliance  with  the  Samnites  in  C 4s  is attested  by  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 15.5.2.  A  navy  is  attested  for C 4s  (Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 15.6.3). Reception  of  envoys  is  attested  in  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 15.5.1, 2  (rC 4s).  The  presbeis  sent  by  Taras  to  Neapolis  in  C 4s  were proxenoi  of  Neapolis  according  to  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 15.5.2. Neapolis  received  refugees  from  Kyme  when  that  city  fell to  the  Samnites  in  421,  according  to Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 15.6.4;  it  is  not  clear  from  the  text  whether  the  Kymaians  were granted  citizenship,  and  the  coins  struck  by  the  Neapolitan mint  in  the  name  of  Kyme  (Rutter  ( 1979)  96)  may  indicate that  Kymaian  identity  remained  alive  at  Neapolis  (cf.  Dion. Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 15.6.4,  reporting  the  existence  of  a  group  of Kymaians  at  Neapolis  c. 327;  cf.  Lomas  ( 2000)  178).  At  an unknown  date  (C 4?),  Neapolis,  after  a  stasis,  received  some Kampanians  as  synoikoi;  obviously  these  were  granted  citi- zenship,  since  they  were  entitled  to  hold  the  office of  demar- chos  (Strabo  5.4.7;  cf.  Livy  8.21ff;  Lomas  ( 2000)  177\u00ad78). Neapolis  experienced  a  stasis,  presumably  in  C 4  (Strabo 5.4.7).  The  office of  demarchos,  at  first g iven  only  to  Greeks, but  later  to  non-Greeks  absorbed  into  the  citizenry  as  well (Strabo  5.4.7;  cf.  Lomas  ( 2000)  177\u00ad78),  may  indicate  a  dem- ocratic  constitution.  A  boule,an  ekklesia  and  the  procedure of  probouleusis  are  attested  for  C 4s  by  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 15.6.1\u00ad3  (cf.  Ghinatti  ( 1996)  103\u00ad6). Neapolis  was  founded  on  a  sloping  coastal  plateau,  where bradyseism  has  caused  changes  to  the  coastline  and  hin- dered  an  identification of  the  ancient  harbour  site.  The plateau  was  fortified b y  a  circuit  wall  c. 3.8  km  long  and enclosing  an  area  of  c. 75  ha;  it  is  a  C 4  double  curtain-wall  in ashlar  with  internal  fill,  but  stretches  built  in  another  type  of tufa  rock  and  in  a  different  technique  go  back  to  the  period of  foundation  c. 470  (Napoli  ( 1959)  31\u00ad40;  Fratta  ( 2002) 68\u00ad69).  One  isolated  stretch  may  testify  to  a  diateichisma wall  rather  than  a  C 4  enlargement  of  the  urban  area.  The location  of  the  gates  of  the  Greek  city  is  based  upon  the  main territorial  routes,  the  mediaeval  gates  of  Naples  and  upon the  location  of  the  cemeteries  (E.  Greco  ( 1985a)  191\u00ad99). The  layout  of  the  ancient  city  is  clearly  mirrored  in  the city  plan  of  the  mediaeval  city,  one  of  the  most  spectacular examples  of  the  survival  of  an  ancient  street  plan,  with  three east\u00adwest  plateiai  and  about  twenty  north\u00adsouth  stenopoi clearly  revealing  the  orthogonal  urban  layout  (Castagnoli ( 1956)  36\u00ad37).  The  use  of  long  narrow  insulae  is  very  similar to  the  town plans  of  C 5  Himera  (no. 24)  and  Naxos  (no. 41) and  therefore  possibly  comtemporary  with  the  foundation, or  slightly  later.  To  judge  from  the  evidence  provided  by the street  plan  as  preserved  in  the  mediaeval  city,  most  of  the area  inside  the  circuit  wall  was  urbanised;  there  are,  how- ever,  no  structural  remains  of  habitation,  but  on  the  basis  of better-known  sites,  E.  Greco  ( 1985a)  199\u00ad216  estimates  two rows  of  ten  houses  per  insula,  with  seven  or  eight  inhabit- ants  per  house,  and  hence  an  urban  population  of 1,000\u00ad8,000  inhabitants.  The  elevated  north-western  part of  the  city  formed  an  acropolis-like  area  which  fell  outside the  regular  urban  layout  and  was  very  likely  destined  for sanctuaries,  as  indicated  by  votive  deposits  (E.  Greco ( 1985a)). The  remains  of  monumental  Roman  structures  in  the upper  part  of  the  city  adjoining  the  \"acropolis\"  provide strong  evidence  for  the  location  of  an  upper,  probably  polit- ical  agora,  and  a  lower,  probably  mercantile  agora  (E.  Greco ( 1985a)  208,(1985b));  the  Roman  theatre of  the  lower  agora (forum)  probably  had  a  Greek  predecessor,  but  there  is  no archaeological  evidence  (Johannowsky  ( 1985)).  There  is evidence  of  ephebeia  and  gymnasia  in  the  Hellenistic  period (Strabo  5.4.7). Rich  votive  deposits  from  the  area  of  S.  Aniello,  mainly C 5\u00adC4  in  date  and  of  a  type  ascribed  to  Demeter  and  the chthonic  divinities,  indicate  a  major  sanctuary  with  a  his- tory  going  back  to a  pre-foundation  phase  situated  in  the north-western  \"acropolis\"  area  of  the  city  (Borriello  and  De Simone  ( 1985)).  A  number  of  literary  sources,  albeit  late, attest  the  importance  of  the  Demeter  cult  at  Neapolis  (Stat. Silv. 3.5.79,  4.8.45\u00ad47;  Cic.  Balb. 55).  A  cult  of  the  Siren Parthenope,  the  eponymous  nymph  of  Parthenope  (on which  see  the  Introduction,  supra),  is  attested  in  late  sources only,  but  a  cult  of  her  father,  Acheloos,  is  indirectly  attested by  representation  of  the  river-god  on  C 5  coins  (Rutter  ( 1979) 44\u00ad45  for  sources).  According  to  Timaios  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 98,  the  Athenian  nauarchos  Diotimos  played  an  important role  as  instigator  of  a  torch  race  in  honour  of  the  Siren Parthenope  at  Neapolis  (Frederiksen  ( 1984)  104\u00ad6;  Raviola ( 1991)  24\u00ad27;  for  an  overall  survey  of  sources,  see  Valenza Mele  ( 1993)  168,  171). The  four  known  cemeteries  were  situated  along  the  cardi- nal  east,  north,  west  and  south/south-west  radial  roads,  with inhumation,  cist-slab  tombs  and  tile  tombs  dating  to 284 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo C 5\u00adC4,  replaced  in  C 4l  by  cremation  tombs  (Borriello  et al. ( 1985)  228\u00ad31).  The  evidence  from  the  cemetery  of  Castel Capuano  confirms the foundation date,  with  burials  from c. 470  (ibid. 232\u00ad74). The  coinage  of  Neapolis  has  been  exhaustively  treated  by  K. Rutter,  who  divides  it  into  four  main  periods  between  450  and 385  (Rutter  ( 1979)  42\u00ad59).  Minting  began  c. 450  (ibid. 46)  or c. 470  at  the  time  of  foundation  (Cantilena  ( 1985);  Valenza Mele  ( 1993)  172).The  earliest  coinage  is  represented  by  a  single specimen  of  a  didrachm  on  the  Euboian  standard:  obv.  head  of Parthenope  in  profile;  rev.  forepart  of  bearded  man-faced bull,  Acheloos,  father  of  Parthenope;  legend:  (Rutter  ( 1979)  46,  142;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  545).  There  are  stylistic affinities w ith  the  coins  of  Gela  (the  rev.  type)  and  Syracuse (the  obv.  type).  C. 450  commenced  a  more  regular  issue  of didrachms,  obols  and  minor  fractions  on  the  Phokaian  stan- dard  (Rutter  ( 1979)  46).  The  head  of  Parthenope,  normally shown  in  profile,  at  times  in  three-quarter  view  (Rutter  ( 1979) 52;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  546,  552,  563;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 385),  continues  as the  most  frequent  obv.  type  until  the  city  ceased  to  coin  c. 385. The  rev.  has  a  river-god,  either  the  local  stream  Sebethis  or Sebethos  (named  on  an  obol  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  558)),  or  perhaps rather  Acheloos  attested  in  local  myths  (Rutter  ( 1979)  43\u00ad45), here  represented  as  a  walking  bull,  at  first as in nature,  later with  a  human  face  or  head,  at  times  accompanied  by  a  female  figure,  probably  Nike,  flying above and crowning  the  bull  with  a  garland  (an  allusion  to games  held  in  honour  of  Parthenope?:  Rutter  ( 1979)  45).  The  rev.  has  legend ,  or  variations,  for which  see  the  onomastic  section  above  (SNG  Cop.  Italy 386\u00ad94).One  issue  carries  the  ktetic  on the  obv.  (cf.  Guarducci,  EG  ii. 623;  Rutter  ( 1979)  47;Rutter, HN \u00b3  546).  From  c. 420  some  issues  have  on  the  obv.  a helmet- ed  head  of  Athena  of  Corinthian  inspiration  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  554; SNG  Cop.  Italy 382\u00ad83),  not  easily  explained  in  C 5s  Neapolis, but  according  to  K.  Rutter  possibly  reflecting Diotimos'  visit there  mentioned  by  Timaios  (FGrHist  ( 566)  fr. 98;  cf.  Rutter ( 1979)  45,  95;  Frederiksen  ( 1984)  104\u00ad5;  for  Athenian  settlers  at Neapolis,  see  supra).  Most  obols  have  obv.  head  of  Athena, at  times  wearing  Attic  helmet;  rev.  mussel  shell,  on  early  issues, later  forepart  of  man-faced  bull,  legend   and  abbreviations  thereof  (Rutter  ( 1979)  50\u00ad51,  58;Rutter, HN \u00b3548,  555;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 384).  Neapolis  minted  coins  for the  Kampanian  Samnite  communities:  Kyme  c. 420\u00ad380, Capua  c. 415\u00ad400,Hyria  405\u00ad385,  Nola 400\u00ad380,  Allifae 400\u00ad395,  and  for  the  Fistelians  405\u00ad400  and  the  Fenserni 400\u00ad390  (Rutter  ( 1979)). 64.

Sybaris  is  implicitly  described  as  patre (  patris)  in  Hdt. 6.127.1\u00ad4. Sybaris  was  founded  in  the  last  quarter  of  C 8  ( 721/20:  Ps.- Skymnos  360;or 709/8:  Euseb.  Chron. 91b  Helm),  a  date  con- firmed b y  archaeological  evidence  (Guzzo  ( 1982a)).  It  was commonly  regarded  as  an  Achaian  foundation  (Antiochos (FGrHist 555)  fr. 12;  Ps.-Skymnos  340),  but  Arist.  Pol. 1303a29 describes  it  as  a  joint  foundation  of  Troizenians  (no. 367) and  Achaians.  Solin. 2.10  describes  it  as  founded  by Troizenians  and  Sagaris,  the  son  of  the  Lokrian  Aias;  Ant. Lib.  Met. 8.7  describes  it  as  a  Lokrian  foundation,  but  this Lokrian  tradition  is  presumably  simple  aetiology,  entirely without  historical  value  (Papathomopoulos  ad  Ant.  Lib. 8.7).  The  oecist  is  reported  to  have  been  Is  of  Helike  (Strabo 6.1.12;  Pugliese  Carratelli  ( 1972\u00ad73)  17;  Morgan  and  Hall ( 1996)  204;  Bugno  ( 1999)). Greek  finds show that the chora  of  Sybaris  extended  as  far as  the  valleys  of  the  rivers  Krathis  and  Sybaris  (modern Coscile).  Northwards  the  settlement  of  Amendolara (  Lagaria  according  to  de  La  Geni\u00e8re  ( 1991b))  delimits  the Sybarite  and  Sirite areas  of  influence,  southwards  the  border between  Sybarite  and  Krotoniate  areas  of  influence is unclear  (Guzzo  ( 1982a)).  There  is  archaeological  evidence, as  early  as  C 8,  of  Sybarite  influence far inland along the routes  offering  shortcuts  to the  Tyrrhenian  coast  (survey  in de  La  Geni\u00e8re  ( 1978)  344\u00ad54),  and  the  defeat  of  Sybaris  by Kroton  (no. 56)  in  510  is  reflected in the abandonment of italia  and  kampania  295 sites  on  the  Tyrrhenian  coast,  e.g.  at  Petrosa  di  Scalea  (cf.

CEG 394;C5s  graffito:  Arena  ( 1996)  no. 28.9)  with  C 7 temples  was  located  in  the  hinterland  of  Sybaris  on  the plateau  of  Timpone  della  Motta  (Francavilla  Marittima;  de La  Geni\u00e8re  ( 1989);  R.  Russo  ( 1996);  Maaskant  Kleibrink ( 2000);  Ridgway  ( 2002)  135\u00ad36),  the  site  of  an  earlier indigenous  settlement  identified b y  some  as  Lagaria  (cf. Strabo  6.1.14).  There  is  evidence  of  a  rural  sanctuary  of  Hera further  inland  en  route  for  Laos,  mentioned  on  the inscribed  axe  found  at  S.  Sosti  (Arena  ( 1996)  no. 36.15;  cf. Steph.  Byz. 589.14  with  discussion  by  Lucca  ( 1994)). The  heyday  of  Sybaris  was  the  Archaic  period  down  to 510,  the  date  of  its  crushing  defeat  at  the  hands  of  the Krotoniates.  In  the  C 6f  war  against  Siris  (no. 69),Sybaris  was allied  with  Kroton  (no. 56)  and  Metapontion  (no. 61)  (Just. Epit. 20.2.3\u00ad4).  By  C 6m  at  the  latest  Sybaris  had  come  to control  a  vast  dominion  (comprising,  according  to the inflated r eport  by  Strabo  6.1.13,four  neighbouring  ethne  and twenty-five   poleis  hypekooi;  cf.  Ampolo  ( 1992)  246  with refs.);  in  extent,  the  dominion  of  Sybaris  may  have  been  as large  as  c. 3,000  km \u00b2  (Ampolo  ( 1992)  247).At least  one  of  the mechanisms  employed  by  Sybaris  to  control  its  dependen- cies  was  a  hegemonic  symmachia:ML 10  ( 550\u00ad525)  shows the  city  as  the  leader  of  an  alliance  including  the  Serdaioi and  other  unspecified symmachoi.  Apparently  some  of  the cities  and  communities  in  the  dominion  of  Sybaris  issued coins,  while  others  did  not;  this  may  perhaps  be  a  reflection of  differences  in  degree  of  dependency.  Numismatic  evi- dence  suggests  that  Laos  (no. 58),  Temesa  (no. 72)  and  the unidentified settlements or c ommunities  of  Ami[-]  and  the So[-]  were  also  subordinate  to  Sybaris  (Parise  ( 1984)  253, ( 1988)  307\u00ad9;  cf.  also  Rutter  ( 1997)  22\u00ad27  and  the  list  of  pre- Hellenistic  settlements  supra).  According  to  Diod. 12.9.2 (rC 6),  Sybaris  granted  citizenship  to  many  foreigners,  and this  may  possibly  be  connected  with  the  control  of  the dominion  (Rutter  ( 1970)  171).  The  city  was  also  active as coloniser,  founding  Laos  (no. 58)  prior  to 510  and Poseidonia  (no. 66)  c. 600;  see  also  Skidros  in  the  list  of  non- polis  sites  supra. The  large  figures r eported  for  the  number  of  citizens ( 100,000  astoi:  Ps.-Skymnos  341;  300,000  politai:Diod. 10.23,  12.9.2)  or  armed  forces  ( 300,000  men:  Diod. 10.23  and Strabo  6.1.13;  50,000  horse:  Ath. 519C  Timaeus  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 50),  although  obviously  legendary,  may  all  the  same indicate  a  very  populous  city;  the  size  of  the  urban  area (c. 500  ha,  infra)  confirms that S ybaris  was  indeed  a  large city. The  city  was  founded  on  a  row  of  coastal  dunes  parallel  to the  coast  between  the  rivers  Krathis  and  Sybaris.  It  had  a perimeter  of 50  stades  (c. 9\u00ad10  km)  according  to  Strabo  6.1.13, possibly  implying  a  circuit  wall  though  there  is  no  archaeo- logical  evidence  of  such  a  wall.  However,  recent  investiga- tions  indicate  that  the  extent  of  the  city  was  about  500  ha. Most  of  the  urban  remains  lie  under  4  m-deep  alluvial deposits,  not,  however,  unequivocally  to  be  connected  with Kroton's  destruction  of  Sybaris  (Strabo  6.1.13).  However,  the destruction  of 510  is  archaeologically  attested  and  revealed by  destroyed  and  flooded strata (Guzzo ( 1976)  51,(1997)  379). Only  about  5  ha  ( 1  per  cent  of  the  presumed  urban  area!)  has been  investigated  by  excavations.  The  earliest  Greek  materi- al  confirms a foundation in C 8l  (Guzzo  ( 1982a))  but  the structural  remains  are  later,  and  it  is  uncertain  whether  the first phase c omprised  one  large  settlement  or  a  plurality  of smaller  nucleated  settlements  (Guzzo  ( 1982a)  241,  243).  The C 7\u00adC6  remains  came  to  light  in  two  zones,  \"Parco  di Cavallo\"  and  \"Stombi\",  c. 1,800  m  apart,  and  revealed  some consistent  orientation  though  the  overall  urban  layout  of  the city  is  uncertain  (Carando  ( 1999)).  An  industrial  quarter  is evidenced  by kilns  (Various  authors  ( 1972),  ( 1973), ( 1988\u00ad89)).  Architectural  fragments  from  \"Parco  di  Cavallo\" testify  to  a  major  C 6s  temple  (a  Heraion?),  and  there  is  fur- ther  evidence  of  a  monumental  rectangular  C 6  building, probably  with  a  public  purpose  (Zancani  Montuoro ( 1972\u00ad73a);  Various  authors  ( 1988\u00ad89)  27\u00ad28). There  is  little  evidence  for  cults:  Zeus  and  Apollo  are  list- ed  as  proxenoi  (\"guarantors\")  of  the  symmachia  treaty  ML  10 ( 550\u00ad525).  Dorieus,  who  had  supported  Kroton  against Sybaris  (Hdt. 5.44\u00ad45),  founded  a  sanctuary  with  a  temple for  Athena  Krathia  (Hdt. 5.45)  after  the  defeat  of  Sybaris  by Kroton,  and  votive material  from  \"Stombi\"possibly  refers  to Athena  (Zancani  Montuoro  ( 1972\u00ad73a)  67);  further  evid- ence  for  Athena  in  CEG 394  ( 600\u00ad550).A  number  of  sources refer  to the  cult  of  Hera at  Sybaris  (Ael.  VH 3.43;  Ath. 518C; cf.  also  Torelli  ( 1988)  594),  and  c.C 6m  structural  remains have  been  attributed  to  a  Heraion  (supra).  Whether  the  later Thourian  cults  of  Zeus,  Athena,  Aphrodite,  Dionysos  and Herakles  (see  entry  for  Thourioi)  were  in  vogue  in  Sybaris  is unknown  (cf.  Zancani  Montuoro  ( 1972\u00ad73a)  57).  A  festival with  large  monetary  prizes  is  hinted  at  by  Ath. 522D. Two  citizens  of  Sybaris  achieved  Olympic  victories: Philytas  in  616  (Olympionikai 71  (boys'  boxing))  and Kleomrotos  in  C 6f(CEG  394  (event  unknown)),  and  it seems  that  already  by  C 6f  Sybaris  rewarded  its  victors  hand- somely  (Mann  ( 2001)  69\u00ad70,  discussing  CEG 394  ( 6f)).  The Sybarites  seem  to  have  had  treasuries  at  Olympia  (Paus. 296 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo 6.19.9;  Mertens-Horn  and  Viola  ( 1990)  240\u00ad46)  and  at Delphi  (Strabo  9.3.8)  with  rich  dedications  (Ath. 605A\u00adB). For  attempts  to  identify  a  C 6m  treasury  of  the  Sybarites  in the  architectural  remains  at  Delphi,  see  Partida  ( 2000) 261\u00ad63.  In  C 6m,  the  city  published  a  public  document  at Olympia  (ML  10).  Communal  consultation  of  the  Delphic oracle  is  reported  by  Ael.  VH 3.43  (rC 6s). For  the  possible  existence  of  a  system  of  civic  sub- divisions,  see  Jones,  POAG 164\u00ad65.  Little  is  known  of  the constitution  prior  to 510;  an  early  stasis  is  attested  in  Arist. Pol. 1303a25\u00ad31:  it  seems  to  have  been  rooted  in  ethnic  differ- ences  and  ended  with  the  expulsion  of  the  Troizenians  by the  Achaians.  In  general,  the  information  relating  to  the king/tyrant  Telys  and  his  rise  to  power  suggests  that  prior  to his  reign  Sybaris  was  an  oligarchy,  and  the  importance  of  the aristocracy  is  attested  by  the  participation  of  Smindyrides  of Sybaris  in  the  competition  for  the  hand  of  the  daughter  of the  tyrant  Kleisthenes  of  Sikyon  (Hdt. 6.127;Diod.  8.19). Telys  is  described  as  basileus  at  Hdt. 5.44.1,as  tyrannos  at Hdt. 5.44.2;  cf.  Carlier  ( 1984)  470,and  his  rule  as  a  tyrannis  at Heraclid.  Pont.  fr. 49,  Wehrli.  Diod. 12.9.2  describes  him  as having  risen  to  power  as  a  demagogos,  e.g.  by  having  per- suaded  the  Sybarites  to  exile  500  of  the  euporotatoi  citizens and  confiscate their property.  The  exiles  found  refuge  at Kroton  (no. 56),  and  Telys  sent  an  embassy  demanding  the extradition  of  the  exiles  on  threat  of  war  (Diod. 12.9.3).  The Krotoniates  opted  for  war,  and  in  the  ensuing  battle  in  510 they  won  a  decisive  victory  (Diod. 12.9.5\u00ad6),  killed  off  the larger  part  of  the  Sybarite  army  and  went  on  to  sack  the  city (Hdt. 6.21;Diod.  12.10.1).  Thus  Sybarite  power  was  eliminat- ed  and  the  phase  of  Sybarite  history  often  referred  to as \"Sybaris  I\"  came  to  an  end. Sybaris  II.  However,  the  defeat  did  not  mean  the  annihila- tion  of  Sybaris.  Some  citizens  escaped  to  the  Sybarite colonies  of  Laos  (no. 58)  and  Skidros  (Hdt. 6.21.1),  but  other survivors  must  have  remained,  as  appears  from  several pieces  of  evidence:  ( 1)  incuse  coins  inscribed  with  the  abbre- viated  ethnics  of  both  Kroton  and  Sybaris  ( -) indi- cate  that  Sybaris  passed  into  dependency  on  Kroton  (see  \u00a7 2a in  the  numismatic  section  infra  and  the  entry  for  Kroton); and  this  is  confirmed b y  ( 2),  the  report  that  the  Krotoniates appointed  a  governor  at  Sybaris  (Iambl.  VP 74;  Minar  ( 1942) 74;  Rutter  ( 1970)  169);  ( 3)  when  besieged  by  the  Krotoniates in 467,  the  Sybarites  called  on  Hieron  of  Syracuse  for  help (Diod. 11.48.4).  This  implies  a  (fortified) settlement at the site  of  Sybaris  (Rutter  ( 1970)  174),  the  ability  to conduct  for- eign  policy,  and  an  (unsuccessful)  attempt  to  obtain  some independence  from  Krotoniate  hegemony.  There  is,  thus,  no doubt  that  a  polis  of  Sybaris  continued  to  exist,  but  it  was now  a  dependent  polis  of  Kroton  (cf.  Kahrstedt  ( 1918) 181\u00ad82).  To  this  \"Sybaris  II\"  have  been  attributed  the  coins described  in  \u00a7 2b  of  the  numismatic  section  infra. The  size  or  status  of  Sybarite  territory  in  this  period  is unknown.  The  earlier  dominion  of  Sybaris  was  dissolved, and  cities  like  Temesa  (no. 72)  and  Laos  (no. 58)  were  now probably  dependencies  of  Kroton  (no. 56)  as  revealed  by  the second  issue  of  Sybaris,  Kroton  and  Laos  mentioned  in  \u00a7 2a of  the  numismatic  section  infra.  Iambl.  VP 255  (rC 6l)  seems to  indicate  that  at  least  some  Sybarite  land  was  appropriated by Kroton (Rutter ( 1970)  169). Dorieus  founded  a  sanctuary  of  Athena  Krathia  after  the defeat  of  Sybaris  by Kroton  (Hdt. 5.45)  and  the  cult  probably continued  during  C 5.The  importance  of  the  Athena  sanctu- ary  on  the  plateau  of  Timpone  della  Motta  (Francavilla Marittima)  remained  undiminished  during  the  C 5  (de  La Geni\u00e8re  ( 1989)  494\u00ad95). For  \"Sybaris  II\",  as  well  as  for  the  following  phases  of  the city,  the  archaeological  evidence  is  limited.  The  destruction of  \"Sybaris  I\"  is  documented  (supra),  but  there  is  continuity of  life  throughout  C 5,  although  the  finds from and struc- tures  attributable  to C 5e  are  few.  Attribution  of  single  strata or  structural  remains  to  the  different  phases  outlined  above and  below  is  not  possible  as  the  finds most often have a longer  lifespan  than  that  allowed  for  the  individual  phases  of Sybarite  history  (Guzzo  ( 1976)  51\u00ad52). Sybaris  III.  According  to  Diod. 11.90.3\u00ad4  and 12.10.2,  fifty- eight  years  after  the  510  catastrophe  (i.e.  in  453)  a  Thessalian or  a  man  named  Thessalos  ( 11.90.3)  or,  more  unlikely, Thessalians,  refounded  ( 12.10.3)  the  city  (         :  11.90.3; :  12.10.2).  However,  after  a while  (five y ears?)  the  Sybarites  were  driven  out  by  the Krotoniates  ( 12.10.2,  cf. 11.90.4),  and  sent  presbeis  to  Sparta (no. 345)  and  Athens  (no. 361)  requesting  assistance  and reinforcements  in  their  attempt  to  return  (Diod. 12.10.3\u00ad4). This  phase,\"Sybaris  III\",  from  c. 453  to  the  initial  stages  of  the foundation  of  Thourioi  (no. 74),  is  probably  reflected in a new  series  of  double-relief  coins  (cf.  \u00a7 3  in  the  numismatic section  infra). Sybaris  IV.  During  the  first phase of  the  process  which eventually  led  to  the  foundation  of  Thourioi  in  446/5, Sybaris  was  reinforced  by  Athenians  and  Peloponnesians (Diod. 12.10.4)  and  seems  indeed  still  to  have  been  called, and  located  at,  Sybaris  (coins;  cf.  RE  iv \u00b2.  1008;  Rutter  ( 1973) 163).  The  community  was  strongly  dominated  by  Sybarites, italia  and  kampania  297 and  a  period  of  serious  stasis  was  caused  by  the  claims  of  the original  Sybarites  to  privileges  in  the  political,  cultic  and economic  spheres  of  life;  the  Sybarites,  however,  were  put  to death  almost  to  the  last  man  or  expelled,  thus  paving  the  way for  the  foundation  of  Thourioi  proper  (Diod. 12.11.1\u00ad4;  cf. Arist.  Pol. 1303a31\u00ad33  and  Strabo  6.1.13).  To  this  initial \"Sybarite\"  phase  of  Thourioi \"Sybaris  IV\"  have  been attributed  the  coins  described  in  \u00a7 4  of  the  numismatic  section  infra. V.  Sybaris  on  the  Traeis.  The  Sybarites  expelled  from Thourioi  (no. 74)  in  446/5  (cf.\"Sybaris  IV\",  supra),  settled  by the  river  Traeis  according  to  Diod. 12.22.1  (this  settlement remains  unlocated).  According  to  Strabo  6.1.14,  one  tradi- tion  ( ) said that Sybaris on the Teuthras (emended to Traeis  by  Meineke)  was  founded  by  Rhodians.  This  tradition may  reflect a Rhodian settlement,  otherwise  unknown,  in the  region  where  the  Sybarites  later  settled,  or,  more  likely, the  tradition  is  mistaken  (Walbank  ( 2000)  24).To Sybaris  on the  Traeis  are  ascribed  the  coins  described  in  \u00a7 5  of  the numismatic  section  infra.According  to Polyb. 2.39.6,Sybaris combined  with  Kroton  (no. 56)  and  Kaulonia  (no. 55)  to form  an  Achaian  confederation  in  imitation  of  the  home- land  Achaians.  The  date  of  this  confederation,  and  thus  of the  Sybaris  participating  in  it,  is  uncertain,  but  the  date  is probably  C 5s,  and  the  reference  would  then  be  to Sybaris  on the  Traeis  (Walbank,  HCP  ad  loc.  and  ( 2000)  24;Mele ( 1983a)  86  n. 546;  Giangiulio  ( 1989)  177  n. 52,  197).  If  the alliance  dates  to  430\u00ad420,  this  is  the  best  evidence  for  polis status  of  Sybaris  on  the  Traeis,  apart  from  its  coins.  In  any case,  the  city  was  soon  (after     :Diod. 12.22.1) destroyed  by  the  Brettians  and  thus  Sybaris  came  to  a  final end  (ibid.). Sybaris  seems  to  have  struck  coins  in  all  its  different  phas- es  and  manifestations. \u00a7 1.  Coins  of  Sybaris  I.  Coins  on  the  Achaian  standard  were struck  from  c. 540,  possibly  as  the  earliest  of  the  Achaian incuse  coinages  of  South  Italy.  At  first only staters w ere minted,  but  gradually  lower  denominations  with  the  same type  were  also  struck  (drachms,  triobols  and  obols).  The type  shows  a  bull  facing  left  with  head  turned  back,  normal- ly  interpreted  as  a  river  divinity.  Legends: ,  , ,  (Guarducci,  EG  i. 112,  ii. 618; Gorini  ( 1975)  10\u00ad11;Rutter,  HN \u00b31729\u00ad39;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1388\u00ad93).  Sybaris  I  struck  coins  in  some  quantity,  coins which  circulated  from  the  Ionian  to  the  Tyrrhenian  coast. Alongside  this  coinage  are  found  other  series  in  the  same incuse  fabric,  on  the  Achaian  standard  and  with  the  same type  (bull  looking  back),  but  with  legends  referring  to  cities other  than  Sybaris  itself:  Siris  (no. 69)  or  Sirinos/Pyxous (no. 67),  and  two  unknown  sites  named  Ami-  and  So- (Euboic  standard).  An  issue  of  incuse  staters  and  drachms on  the  Achaian  standard,  though  with  the  type  of  a  boar  and the  retrograde  legends  (obv.)  and  (rev.), thought  to  have  been  made  at  some  settlement  of Palinouros  and/or  Molpa,  has  also  been  placed  within  the Sybarite  sphere  of  influence (Parise ( 1972)  esp. 102\u00ad11; Gorini  ( 1975)  9,12\u00ad13).These  issues  are  interpreted  as  having been  struck  under  a  C 6s  hegemony  or  dominion  of  Sybaris, rather  than  as  an  alliance  coinage  (see  the  entries  for  these sites  in  Inventory  and  in  list  of  non-polis  sites  supra). \u00a7 2.  Coins  of  Sybaris  II.  (a)  Incuse  coins  (staters  and  tri- obols)  with  obv.  Krotoniate  tripod,  legend: ;  rev. Sybarite  bull,  legend: ,as well as staters and triobols with obv.  Krotoniate  tripod  with  r.  and  octopus  l.;  rev. Sybarite  bull,  legend: (for  Laos  (no. 58))  in  exergue (Gorini  ( 1975)  26.1;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  p. 145)  can  be  ascribed  to an early  phase  of  Sybaris  II  (C 6l)  when  the  city  was  subordinate to Kroton  (no. 56).  (b)  To  this  Sybaris  may  also  belong incuse  staters  similar  to,  but  stylistically  more  advanced than,  those  of  \u00a7 1,  as  well  as  triobols  with  obv.  standing  bull, legend: ;  rev.  amphora  incuse;  and  obols  with  obv.bull; rev.  acorn  incuse  (Kraay  ( 1958)  15\u00ad16;  Gorini  ( 1975)  12.10\u00ad11, dated  to  530\u00ad510;Rutter,  HN \u00b31740\u00ad43;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1394\u00ad95  (triobols)). \u00a7 3.Coins  of  Sybaris  III.  This  phase,\"Sybaris  III\",  from  c. 453 to  the  foundation  of  Thourioi  (no. 74),  is  probably  reflected in  a  new  series  of  double-relief  coins  issued  under Poseidonian  influence.  Staters:  obv.  striding  Poseidon;  rev. bull  facing  right,  legend: (Rutter,  HN \u00b31743).  Triobols and  obols:  obv.  striding  Poseidon;  rev.  bird  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3 1744\u00ad45;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1397).  In  this  period  Sybaris  also issued  coins  jointly  with  Poseidonia  (no. 66)  and  Laos  (no. 58).  Poseidonia  and  Sybaris  III:  triobols  with  obv.  Poseidon, legend: ;  rev.  bull  facing  right,  legend: (Rutter, HN \u00b31746\u00ad49;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1399\u00ad1401).  Laos  and  Sybaris III:  diobols  with  obv.  bull,  legend:  ethnic  of  Laos;  rev.two circles  (as  on  diobols  of  Laos  proper),  legend: or  and ,  for  Laos  (Rutter,  HN \u00b32284).  Some  triobols  of  Laos: obv.bull;  rev.  acorn  (cf.  \u00a7 2b),legend: on  the  obv.(Rutter, HN \u00b32282;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1398). \u00a7 4.  Coins  of  Sybaris  IV.  To  the  initial  phase  of  the Sybarite\u00adAthenian  settlement  of  Thourioi Sybaris  IV have  been  ascribed  two  issues  with  the  ethnic  and in  the  Ionic  alphabet,  and  types  obv.  helmeted  head of  Athena  (a  reference  to the  Athenian  involvement  in  the 298 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo foundation?);  rev.  (first series) bull looking back in the style of  Sybaris  I  (Rutter,  HN \u00b31750;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1402\u00ad4);  rev.

The  city- ethnic  is  (Steph.  Byz. 437.4). No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  Metauros  a  polis.  It  is included  here  as  a  type  C  on  account  of  Steph.  Byz. 437.4, which  describes  the  C 6  poet  Stesichoros  as  a  native  of Metauros:  \u00b5   ,  \u00b5 .  Stephanos  does  not  provide a  source  reference,  but  the  fact  that  Stesichoros  was  normal- ly  considered  a  Himeraian  (cf.  Stesichoros  TA 33,  35\u00ad36, Davies)  tends  to  suggest  that  he  drew  this  information  from a  written  account  and  not  from  memory.  If  this  source  real- ly  described  Stesichoros  by  the  city-ethnic  of  Metauros  (see Musti  ( 1976)),  then  the  city  may  have  been  a  polis  in  C 6  since such  use  of  the  city-ethnic  often  indicates  that  the  site  to whose  toponym  the  ethnic  is  related  was  a  polis  (Hansen ( 1996)  182\u00ad87),  especially  in  external  contexts  as  in  this  case. Metauros  was  a  foundation  either  of  Zankle  (no. 51) (Solin. 2.11)  or  of  Lokroi  (no. 59;  Steph.  Byz. 437.3).  As  indi- cated  above,  the  political  status  of  Metauros  is  highly  uncer- tain,  and  it  is  not  clear  whether  we  should  envisage  a river-harbour  settlement  in  Lokrian  territory  or  a  polis,at least  for  a  period,  founded  by  Zankle  and  later  subject  to Lokroi.  The  prevailing  interpretation  takes  Metauros  to  be an  originally  Chalkidian,  i.e.  Zanklean,  foundation  later occupied  by  Lokroi,  at  about  the  time  when  that  city  found- ed  Hipponion  (no. 53)  and  Medma  (no. 60),  i.e.  C 7s  (De Franciscis  ( 1960);  Settis  ( 1965)  116\u00ad17;  Musti  ( 1976)  88\u00ad89). The  archaeological  evidence  (infra)  suggests  a  Greek  settle- ment  rather  than  a  Hellenised  non-Greek  site. The  river  Metauros  delimited  the  territory  of  Rhegion (no. 68)  and  Metauros,  which  may  have  been  founded  by Zankle  (and  Rhegion?,  infra)  in  opposition  to Lokrian expansion,  later  becoming  part  of  Lokrian  territory  (supra). The  territory  of  Metauros  is  delimited  to  the  south  by  the Petracce  (river  Metauros)  and  to  the  north  by  the  territory of  Medma.  There  is  indirect  evidence  of  an  extra-urban sanctuary  500  m  to  the  south-east  of  the  city  (Orsi  ( 1902), ( 1923)).  Sporadic  finds of  arulae  c. 1  km  to  the  south  may indicate  another  extra-urban  sanctuary,  though  habitation or  a  cemetery  cannot  be  ruled  out  (Sabbione  and  Soverini ( 1950)  145).Architectural  terracottas  of  a  Greek  temple  have been  reported  near  Gioia  Tauro  (Gagliardi  ( 1958)). 282 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo The  settlement  of  Metauros  occupied  a  flat plateau,  c. 1  km from  the  coast  and  c. 2  km  to  the  north  of  the  river  Metauros. The  extent  of  the  settlement  is  unknown:  it  may  have  com- prised  the  area  of  the  plateau  only,  or  part  of  the  terrace below  as  well,  but  a  conservative  estimate  is  that  the  settle- ment  comprised  about  60  ha.  De  Franciscis  ( 1960)  59 suggested  that  the  settlement  was  located  on  the  plain  and that  the  upper  plateau  was  the  acropolis  of  the  city;  however, the  few  remains  in  the  lower  city  are  Roman. The  settlement  was  delimited  northwards  and  south- eastwards  by  cemeteries,  where  a  large  number  of  tombs have  yielded  useful  evidence  of  the  cultural  connections  of Metauros:  the  C 7f\u00adC6  tombs  contained  mixed  Greek  and indigenous  grave  goods  indicating  a  mixed  population;  the Greek  wares  reveal  ties  with  the  Chalkidian  cities  of  Zankle and  Rhegion  and  above  all  with  Mylai,  but  overall  a  wide commercial  network  is  revealed  by  the  tomb  material  (De Franciscis  ( 1960);  Sabbione  ( 1981b),  ( 1986)).  Later,  Greek acculturation  was  total,  and  a  period  of  Lokrian  influence is revealed  by  Lokrian  and  Medmean  coroplastic  finds and a change  in  funeral  rites  (Sabbione  ( 1987);  Cordiano  ( 1995b) 91  n. 29).  Burials  cease  C 6l,  and  very  few  tombs  are  known from  C 5.Such  evidence  may  point  to  a  termination  of  settle- ment  C 5l\u00adC4e,  perhaps  due  to  Leukanian  pressure. 63.

The  external  individual  use  is  found  in  IG xii.9  187A (  ML 82  (c. 411))  and  IG xii.9  187B  (C 4e). Taras  was  a  colony  of  Sparta  (no. 345;  Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 13;Ephor.  fr. 216;  Pl.  Leg. 637B;  Arist.  Pol. 1306b31;  cf. Cartledge  ( 1979)  123\u00ad24  and  Malkin  ( 1994)  128  with  n. 68) founded  in  C 8l  ( 706  according  to Euseb.  Chron. 91,  Helm;  cf. Van  Compernolle  ( 1992)  774).  By  the  late  Archaic  (Nafissi ( 1999)  246,  255)  and  Classical  periods  there  existed  a  full legendary  account  of  the  foundation  (locc.  citt.):  Taras  was founded  by  the  so-called  Partheniai  (locc.  citt.),  a  group  of Spartan  citizens  (     \u00b5,  Arist.)  who  had  become atimoi  (Antiochos)  and  attempted  revolution  (Arist.).  The oikistes  was  Phalanthos  (Antiochos).  The  city  owed  its  name to  the  hero  Taras,  eponym also  of  the  river  Taras (Antiochos);  see  Lo  Porto  ( 1964)  178\u00ad84;  Moscati Castelnuovo  ( 1991);  Malkin  ( 1994)  115\u00ad42;  Nafissi ( 1999) 251\u00ad58.  The  foundation  of  Taras  is  connected  with  that  of Satyrion,  mentioned  in  the  oracle  to  Phalanthos  (Diod. 8.21.3)  and  probably  earlier  than  Taras.  Satyrion  is  identified with  settlement  remains  at  Saturo  on  the  coast  c. 12  km  to  the south-east  of  Taras,  where  Lakonians  occupied  the  Iapygian site  a  few  years  before  settling  at  Taras  (Lo  Porto  ( 1964)). Satyrion  probably  continued  as  a  trading  station  serving Taras. The  name  of  the  territory  was  (Antiochos (FGrHist 555)  fr. 3  apud  Strabo  6.1.4);  it  bordered  on  the  ter- ritory  of  Brentesion  (no. 78)  (Strabo  6.3.6).  It  was  soon occupied  by  sanctuaries,  which  seem  to  have  delimited  the chora,  and  by  several  small  Greek(?)  settlements,  at  times fortified,  and  cemeteries  situated  in  the  hills  surrounding the  plain  of  Taras  (Corchiaro  ( 1981);  E.  Greco  ( 1995b)  87); however,  none  of  these  settlements  is  with  certainty  identi- fied as T arantine  (Lamboley  ( 1996)  6),  and  in  any  case  they were  soon  eclipsed  by  Taras  itself  (E.  Greco  ( 1981b);  Nenci ( 1987)  198  (Cavallino)).  From  C 7  to C 4m  the  chora  gradual- ly  expanded  towards  the  north-east  and  south-east,  and grew  from  c. 350  km \u00b2  to c. 1,000  km \u00b2  (Alessio  and  Guzzo ( 1989\u00ad90);  Osanna  ( 1992)  11\u00ad16).  Early  warfare  against Metapontion  (no. 61)  for  control  or  expansion  of  the  territ- ory  seems  implied  by  Strabo  6.1.15.  In  the  Classical  period Taras  fought  several  wars  against  both  Greek  and  non-Greek communities,  presumably  for  territorial  control:  in  473,  the city  was  severely  defeated  by  the  Iapygians  (Diod. 11.52.3\u00ad4; cf.  Hdt. 7.170.3\u00ad4);  C 5f  victories  over  the  Messapioi  and  the Peuketioi  were  commemorated  at  Delphi  (Lazzarini  ( 1976) no. 971;  cf.  Paus. 10.10.6:  Messapioi;  Lazzarini  ( 1976)  no. 972; cf.  Paus. 10.13.10:  Peuketioi).  Dedications  of  spoils  taken from  Thourioi  (no. 74)  were  made  at  Olympia  c. 440  (IvO 254\u00ad56  ML 57);  Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 11  explicitly states  that  the  latter  war  was  fought  for  control  of  the  Siritis.  The  war  was  ended  by  an  agreement  to  found  a  joint  colony  which  developed  into  Herakleia  (no. 52) (ibid. Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 158).  In  C 4,  the  city  under  Archytas had  close  ties  with  Dionysios  II  of  Syracuse,  securing Syracusan  influence in the A driatic  (Pl.  Ep. 7.339D;  Dem. 61.46;  Brauer  ( 1986)  43\u00ad59).  Also  in  C 4,  Taras  fought  the Messapioi  (Iambl.  VP 197),  and  the  Leukanians  (Diod. 16.61.4  (r 356);  cf.  Diod. 16.62.4,  88.3).  Such  wars  induced  the city  to  seek  help  from  Sparta  (no. 345)  in  340  (Sparta  sent Archidamos:  Theopomp.  fr. 232;Diod.  16.62.4,  63.1)  and from  Alexander  I  of  Epeiros  in  334\u00ad330  (Strabo  6.3.4;  Just. italia  and  kampania  299 Epit. 12.2.1,  23.1.15).  Conflicts w ith  the  local  population  may  have  been  a  feature  of  Tarantine  life  right  from  the beginning,  for  the  city  itself  presumably  took  over  the  site  of  a  pre-existing  non-Greek  community  (Lo  Porto  ( 1970) 356). During  the  period  of  democratic  rule  in  C 4  Taras  was very  powerful,  and  its  military  forces  comprised  the  largest fleet of  Magna  Graecia  (naval  forces  are  attested  already  by Thuc. 8.91.2).  Allegedly,  Taras  could  muster  30,000  infantry, 3,000  cavalry  and  1,000  hipparchoi  (Strabo  6.3.4)  in  the  age of  Archytas.  Diodorus  has  20,000  infantry  and  2,000  cavalry ( 20.104.2  (r 303))  as  the  citizen  troops  mobilised  by Kleonymos  in  303.  And  Taras  was  known  as  the  most  popu- lous  of  the  cities  of  Magna  Graecia  (Ps.-Skymnos  330).If  the army figures are of  the  right  order  of  magnitude,  Taras,  at  its peak  in  C 4,  must  have  had  a  citizen  population  of  over 100,000  plus  an  unknown number  of  foreigners  and  slaves (on  the  basis  of  these  army  figures,  Wuilleumier  ( 1939) 173\u00ad74  calculates  a  C 4m  citizen  population  of 240,000  and  a C 4l  one  of 155,000;  Beloch  ( 1886)  302  suggests 60,000  for C 3l).  The  large  extent  of  the  C 5\u00adC4  city,  c. 530  ha,  may  sup- port  a  high  population  figure,  though  the  intramural  area included  the  cemetery  (Polyb. 8.28.7). In C 5l\u00adC4e,  Taras  was  presumably  a  member  of  the Italiote  League  (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 230).  A  treaty  of  symmachia with  Rhegion  (no. 68)  is  attested  for  473  by Diod. 11.52.3  (cf. Hdt. 7.170.3).  Some  kind  of  treaty  ( \u00b5) between Taras  and  Thourioi  (no. 74)  concerning  a  joint  colony  is implied  by Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 12  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 158,  and  Taras  seems  to  have  been  the  senior  partner  in  this collaboration  (      ). Thuc. 8.91.2  refers  to Tarantine  naval  forces  supporting Sparta  against  Athens,  thus  implying  a  treaty  with  Sparta. The  arrangement  with  Sparta  which  led  to  the  expedition  of Archidamos  in  344  is  described  as  a  symmachia  by Theopomp.  fr. 232  and  Diod. 16.62.4,  63.1. A  board  of  strategoi  is  attested  down to C 3e  (Zonar. 8.2); their  number  is  unknown  (Urso  ( 1998)  1\u00ad10).  Diog.  Laert. 8.79  (rC 4m)  refers  to  a  law  stipulating  that  the  office of  strat- egos  could  not  be  held  in  two  consecutive  years.  However, Archytas  exceptionally  served  continuously  (from  367  or from  356)  for  six  (Ael.  VH 7.14)  or  seven  years  (Aristox.  fr. 48, Wehrli;  cf.  Strabo  6.3.4;  only  Suda,  s.v. ,  describes him  as   ,  but  it  is  uncertain whether  this  refers  to  an  office of  the  Italiote  League  or  an extraordinay  office of  the  city  as  attested  for  C 3e  (Zonar. 8.2: 281)).  Plut.  Quaest.  Graec. 42  (  Theophr.  fr. 133,  Wimmer) describes  a  meeting  of  the  assembly  at  which  a  strategos refused  to  recognise  the  outcome  of  a  vote  taken  by  show  of  hands,  but  it  is  unclear  whether  he  was  relying  on  the  con- stitutional  powers  of  the  office t o  do  so.  Strategoi  were appointed  by  election  (Ael.  VH 7.14). An  exile  is  mentioned  at  Hdt. 3.138.1.  Reception  of  envoys in  C 4m  is  attested  in  Aristox.  fr. 50,  Wehrli,  and  implied  by Hdt. 3.138.2  (rC 6l);  sending  of  envoys  is  attested  in Theopomp.  fr. 232  and  Diod. 16.62.4  (r 346/5).  Citizens  of Taras  were  appointed  proxenoi  by Eretria  (no. 370)  c. 411  (IG xii.9  187A  ML 82)  and  C 4e  (IG xii.9  187B),  by  Athens  (no. 361)  in  C 4m  (IG ii\u00b2  248),  and  by  Delphi  (no. 177)  in  C 4l (F.Delphes iii.1135).  Two  citizens  served  as  theorodokoi  of Epidauros  (no. 348)  in  356/5  (IG iv\u00b2.195.44). A  C 4l\u00adC3e  inscription  may  suggest  the  existence  of  some system  of  civic  subdivisions  (Jones,  POAG 161).  At  3.126.2 Herodotos  refers  to a    ;if  by basileus  Herodotos  means  tyrannos  (the  two  terms  are sometimes  interchangeable,  cf. 5.44.1  and 44.2;Luraghi ( 1994)  76\u00ad77),  Taras  may  have  experienced  a  tyranny  in  C 6l. However,  since  Taras  was  a  Spartan  colony,  the  existence  of some  kind  of  formal  monarchy  is  not  impossible  (Malkin ( 1994)  132  with  n. 87;  add:  Phot.  s.v. ;  Nafissi ( 1999) 251).  Democracy  was  introduced  shortly  after  the  Persian Wars  (Arist.  Pol. 1303a5);  prior  to  that  the  constitution  was  a politeia,  presumably  favouring  the  gnorimoi,  since  Aristotle reports  that  the  change  of  constitution  was  occasioned  by heavy  losses  among  the  gnorimoi  in  a  war  against  the Iapygians.  At  Pol. 1291b23,too,Aristotle  presumably  classifies Taras  as  a  democracy,  and  at  Pol. 1320b11\u00ad14  Taras  is  again classified as a democracy c ombining  democratic  sortition and  oligarchic  election  in  the  selection  of  magistrates:  all archai  were  dittai,  and  on  each  board  some  positions  were filled b y  lot  and  others  by  election;  or,  alternatively,  some magistracies  were  filled b y  election,  others  by  sortition. Strabo  6.3.4  refers  to C 4  Taras  as  a  democracy.  No  stasis proper  is  on  record (Berger  ( 1992)  53),  but  the  foundation legend  included  a  stasis  immediately  after  the  foundation (Just.  Epit. 3.4.11)  in  which,  among  others,  the  oecist  was exiled  (Malkin  ( 1994)  129\u00ad30). Arist.  Pol. 1320b11ff  refers  to a  plurality  of  boards  of  mag- istrates.  The  existence  of  ephoroi  at  the  metropolis  Sparta  as well  as  the  C 5s  Tarantine  colony  Herakleia  (IG xiv  645.i.1 (C 4l);  SEG 30  1162\u00ad70  (C 4l\u00adC3e))  may  suggest  the  existence of  this  office at A rchaic  and  Classical  Taras  as  well,  but  it  is attested  only  from  C 3e  (SEG 40  901),  when  the  office was eponymous.  The  (Etym.  Magn.  s.v. ) were  probably  charged  with  the  custody  of  the  laws.  The interpretation  of  the  numerous  monograms  found  on  C 4 300 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo coins  is  disputed:  they  may  be  names  of  ephoroi  (Brunetti ( 1960)  48\u00ad50),  monetary  magistrates  or  artists,  or  of  chief civic  magistrates  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  pp. 95\u00ad96).A  prytanis  and  an [-] are attested by C4\u00adC2  epigraphic  evidence (Viola  ( 1894)  61.3).  The  assembly  was  named  (i.e. :  Hesychius  s.v.). The  almost  triangular  Tarentine  peninsula  terminates  in the  isthmus,  the  akropolis  according  to Strabo  6.3.1.The lagoon,  Mare  Piccolo,  with  the  inner  harbour  was  reached by  the  natural  waterway  to  the  west  of  the  isthmus,  the  stoma tou  limenos  of  Strabo  6.3.1  (the  artificial canal between the acropolis-isthmus  and  the  eastern  hinterland  was  cut  in C 15  ad,  and  the  modern  island  status  of  the  isthmus  is  not ancient).  The  acropolis,  a  low  plateau  measuring  c. 16  ha  (Lo Porto  ( 1970)  362)  surrounded  by  steep  slopes,  may  have  been strengthened  with  an  ashlar  circuit  wall  in  C 6  (ibid. 359; Strabo  6.3.1  seems  to  imply  that  the  whole  city,  including  the acropolis,  was  fortified).  The  isthmus  was  the  site  of  the  earliest  Greek  settlement  and  the  early  sanctuaries;  the archaeological  evidence  confirms the t raditional  C 8l  date for  the  foundation  (Lo  Porto  ( 1970)  357\u00ad58;  De  Juliis  ( 1983) 429;  Boschung  ( 1994)  177).  No  structural  remains  of  the early  habitation  phases  are  extant,  but  the  evidence  from Ortygia  (Syracuse)  suggests  a  C 6  origin  for  the  east\u00adwest plateia  with  orthogonally  joined  stenopoi  in  accordance with  a  per  strigas  urban  system  (Lo  Porto  ( 1970)  361\u00ad62). The  early  settlement  had  extended  as  far  as  the  nearest part  of  the  adjoining  eastern  plateau  at  least  by  C 5,  and Strabo  6.3.1  locates  the  agora  immediately  to  the  east  below the  acropolis  in  the  narrow  space  delimited  to  the  west  by the  Archaic  cemetery.  From  C 5s  the  urban  area  measured c. 530  ha  (E.  Greco  ( 1981b)  150\u00ad51);  a  c. 10  km-long  circuit  wall built  in  450\u00ad430  incorporated  the  new  urban  extension  and the  Archaic  cemeteries,  with  two  long  straight  walls  con- structed  as  a  double  ashlar  wall,  joining  the  Mare  Piccolo and  the  Mare  Grande  (Lo  Porto  ( 1970)  362\u00ad64).  Sporadic evidence  makes  it  possible  to  reconstruct  a  Hippodamian urban  plan,  probably  contemporary  with  that  of  Thourioi ( 444/3;E.  Greco ( 1981b)  157);  new  cemeteries  and  public spaces  were  laid  out  inside  the  C 5  circuit  (for  the  Archaic and  later  cemeteries:  Moreschini  ( 1988);  Lippolis  ( 1994b)). The  eastern  and  western  ends  of  the  acropolis  were  laid out  as  sanctuaries  from  the  early  history  of  the  colony:  the east  was  the  location  of  the  C 6e  \"Temple  of  Poseidon\",  the earliest  known  monumental  stone  temple  in  Magna  Graecia (Filippi  ( 1976)).  The  divinity  to  whom  the  temple  was  dedi- cated  is,  however,  uncertain:  Stazio  ( 1967)  306\u00ad7  suggests Persephone,  but  Lippolis  ( 1982)  90  Hera.  To  the  west  an  ash- lar  foundation  has  been  taken  to  be  part  of  the  stereobate  of a  temple  of  monumental  size  (Lo  Porto  ( 1970)  376;  but  see Lippolis  ( 1982)  84\u00ad86).  Sanctuaries  were  laid  out  outside  the acropolis  on  the  eastern  plateau,  along  the  Mare  Piccolo where  there  is  some  evidence  of  C 6  cult  (Lippolis  ( 1982) 117ff).  The  whole  coastal  zone  seems  to  have  been  laid  out  as a  vast  sanctuary  with  several  heroa  between  the  harbour  and the  cemeteries  which  have  produced  C 6  evidence of  funeral and  foundation  cults  (Jacobone  ( 1988)). The  inner  harbour,  the  Mare  Piccolo,  was  famous  in antiquity  (Strabo  6.3.1;Polyb.  10.1);  it  was  the  only  natural harbour  in  the  Gulf  of  Taranto  and  the  basis  for  Taras'  econ- omy  and  wealth.  Ashlar  walls  of  uncertain  date  are  inter- preted  as  piers  (Lippolis  ( 1982)  98).A  harbour  (limen)  called Hydrous  is  mentioned  by  Ps.-Skylax  14.  Fishermen  were, according  to  Arist.  Pol. 1291b23,  very  numerous  at  Taras. Significant socio-economic differentiations are implied b y Arist.  Pol. 1320b10,  where  it  is  reported  that  the  aporoi  were allowed  the  use  of  private  property in  order  to win  their favour  for  the  constitution. There  is  only  sparse  evidence  of  public  buildings:  a stepped  structure  near  the  agora  has  been  interpreted  as  a bouleuterion  or  as  a  theatre  (Todisco  ( 1990)  149).  A  theatre near  the  agora  was  used  for  a  C 3l  reception  of  Roman ambassadors  (Dion.  Hal. 19.5.8;Polyb.  8.30.7  (r 213);  cf. Todisco  ( 1990)  146\u00ad49).  A  prytaneion  is  attested  c. 360  (Ath. 700D;  Miller  ( 1978)  no. 434). A  cult  of,  among  others,  the  Atreidai  is  attested  at  Arist. Mir.  ausc. 840a6\u00ad7  (Malkin  ( 1994)  57\u00ad60;for a survey of Tarantine  cults:  Pugliese  Carratelli  ( 1970a);  Hinz  ( 1998) 182\u00ad87).  A  tomb  of  (Apollo)  Hyakinthos  is  mentioned  at Polyb. 8.28.2,  and  Hyakinthos  may  be  depicted  on  coins (infra).  A  cult  of  Dionysos  may  be  inferred  from  C 5e  numis- matic  evidence  (infra);  cf.  Pl.  Leg. 637B.  A  cult  of  the Dioskouroi  may  be  inferred  from  numismatic  evidence (infra;  Wuilleumier  ( 1939)  519\u00ad22).  A  cult  of  Zeus Eleutherios  is  referred  to in  Hesych.  s.v. ' . Anth.  Pal. 6.129  (Leonidas  of  Taras)  concerns  a  dedication  to Athena  Koryphasia(?),  of  spoils  taken  from  the  Leukanians. However,  the  occasion  is  uncertain  (C 3e?),  and  it  is  not  cer- tain  that  Athena  Koryphasia  was  worshipped  in  Taras (Gow-Page,  HE 2  ( xxxiv)  344\u00ad45).  The  evidence  for  other cults  is  uncertain:  Aphrodite  Basilis  (Osanna  ( 1990)); Persephone  (extra-urban  sanctuary:  Wuilleumier  ( 1939) 396);  Apollo  Alaios  (C 4  inscription  on  marble  louterion: Buononato  ( 1960));  hero  cults  of  Phalanthos  and  Taras (Lacroix  ( 1965)  89\u00ad100;  Leschhorn  ( 1984)  31\u00ad41).  Public  sacrifices accompanied b y  demosiai  hestiaseis  are  mentioned italia  and  kampania  301 by Theopomp.  fr. 233.  A  festival  of  Dionysos  is  attested  by  Pl.  Leg. 637B. Communal  consultation  of  the  oracle  at  Dodona  is  attest- ed  in  SGDI 1567/4620  (C 4l\u00adC3e).  Syll. \u00b3295  (C 4)  attests  a grant  of  promanteia  by  Delphi  (no. 177)  to  the  Tarantines (Roux  ( 1990)).  From  520  to 336,  Tarantine  athletes  won  several  Olympic  victories  (Olympionikai 130\u00ad31,  212,  230, 238,  307,  397,  436,  457).  In  500\u00ad475,  a monument commemorating  a  victory  over  the  Messapioi  was  dedicated at  Delphi  (Lazzarini  ( 1976)  no. 971;  cf.  Paus. 10.10.6;  Beschi ( 1982)  232),  and  in  the  same  period  one  commemorating  a victory  over  the  Peuketioi  was  dedicated,  also  at  Delphi (Lazzarini  ( 1976)  no. 972;  cf.  Paus. 10.13.10;  Beschi  ( 1982) 236).  Dedications  of  spoils  taken  from  Thourioi  (no. 74) were  made  at  Olympia  c. 440  (IvO 254\u00ad56  ML 57).  At Delphi  architectural  terracottas  have  be  taken  as  evidence  of a  Tarantine  treasury  (Le  Roy  ( 1967)  70\u00ad87). Taras  initiated  silver  coinage  about  520\u00ad510  (Cahn  ( 1968)) or  slightly  later  (Westermark  ( 1979)  291;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  p. 92) in  the  incuse  technique  on  the  Achaean  standard  with  nomoi divided  into  thirds  as  at  Metapontion  (for  surveys  of Tarantine  coinage  with  refs.,  see  Stazio  ( 1970);  Fischer- Bossert  ( 1999);  Rutter,  HN \u00b3  pp. 92\u00ad93).The  earliest  obv.type shows  a  kneeling  youth  holding  lyre and  flower,  presumably Hyakinthos  or  Eros;  legend: (Rutter,  HN \u00b3824; SNG  Cop.  Italy 766).  The  subsequent  main  obv.  type  of  the nomoi  depicts  a  dolphin  rider  (Taras  or  Phalanthos);  legend: (Rutter,  HN \u00b3826;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 765).  Double- relief  coins  were  minted  from  C 5e:  obv.  dolphin  rider;  rev. various  types  (e.g.  hippocamp,  four-spoked  wheel,  or female  head);  legends: ,  (Westermark ( 1979);  Rutter,  HN \u00b3827,  833,  838;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 767\u00ad78). These  were  accompanied  by  fractions  of  the  nomos:  third-, sixth-,  tenth-  (  litra),  twentieth-  (  hemilitra),  and  sixth- litra  with  a  variety  of  obv.  and  rev.  types  (dolphin,  shell, wheel  or  hippocamp:  Rutter,  HN \u00b3828ff;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 783\u00ad86).A  unique  stater  in  Naples  has  rev.  seated  male  figure holding  a  kantharos  and  distaff,  probably  the  hero  Taras, normally  referred  to  as  the  \"oecist\"  type  but  here  revealing  a connection  with  the  cult  of  Dionysos  (Cahn  ( 1968)  71\u00ad72; Rutter,  HN \u00b3843),  legend: ;  rev.  dolphin  rider,  leg- end: .  From  C 5m  the  types  of  the  nomoi  are  obv. dolphin  rider,  legend: /; rev. seated  male  figure,  the  \"oecist\"  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3844;  SNG  Cop. Italy 779\u00ad82);  half-nomoi  (drachms)  have  obv.  hippocamp; rev.  female  head  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3839;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 787\u00ad88). From C 5s  a  horseman  becomes  the  normal  obv.type;  rev. dolphin  rider,  legend: .  These  are  the main  types  throughout  C 4  with  some  variants  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3 847ff,  868ff;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 797\u00ad829);  obv.  types  have  two riders,  the  Dioskouroi  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  898;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 830);  new  fractions  appeared  in  C 4  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3907ff).  In C 4s  the  city  struck  in  gold  on  the  Attic  standard  on  more than  one  occasion,  usually  with  obv.  type:  head  of  Hera;  rev. young  Taras  appealing  to  seated  Poseidon  (stater),  dolphin rider  (half-stater),  infant  Taras  with  wool  and  distaff  (sixth- stater),  kantharos  (twelfth-stater;  Rutter,  HN \u00b3901\u00ad4);  time of  Alexander  the  Molossian:  stater  with  usual  obv.,  rev. horseman,  in  field sometimes thunderbolt;  twentieth-stater with  obv.  Helios;  rev.  thunderbolt  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  905\u00ad6;  SNG Cop.  Italy 831\u00ad34).  Bronze  coins  were  minted  only  in  C 3 (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  p. 106). Taras  was  the  founder  of  Herakleia  (no. 52),  which  was originally  a  joint  colony  of  Taras  and  Thourioi  (no. 74) (Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 12).  The  foundation  of Herakleia  involved  the  displacement  of  the  previous  inhab- itants  of  Siris  (no. 69;Diod.  12.36.4  (r 433)). 72.

Kaulonia  is  the  second  toponym  listed  at  Ps.-Skylax  13 after  the  heading    ,  where polis  is  used  in the  urban  sense,  cf.  Diod. 14.103.3;  Ps.-Skymnos  320  (r  foun- dation)  calls  it  apoikia.  The  internal  collective  use  of  the city-ethnic  in  found  on  C 5  coins  (infra);  the  external  collec- tive  use  is  found  in  Iambl.  VP 262  and  Polyb. 2.39.6  (both rC 5).  For  the  external  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic,  see Paus. 6.3.11,  commenting  on  the  C 4f  athlete  Dikon  of Kaulonia. Kaulonia  was  an  Achaian  foundation  (Strabo  6.1.10;  Paus. 6.3.12);  it  was  founded  by  Kroton  (no. 56)  (Ps.-Skymnos 318\u00ad19;  Steph.  Byz. 147.9\u00ad10).  The  oikistes  was  Typhon  from Aigion  (Paus. 6.3.12;  Morgan  and  Hall  ( 1996)  209).  Serv.  ad Aen. 3.553  describes  it  as  a  colony  of  Lokroi  (no. 59).The  exis- tence  of  a  C 6e  circuit  wall  (Tr\u00e9ziny  ( 1989)  129)  points  to  a foundation  in  C 7s,  though  Greek  finds go back t o  C 8l (Tr\u00e9ziny  ( 1988)  205). The  name  of  the  territory  was  (Thuc. 7.25.2).The  territory  of  Kaulonia  functioned  as  a  buffer  zone between  Lokroi  and  Kroton.  The  border  between  Lokrian and  Kaulonian  territory was  probably  formed  by the  river Sagra  (Giangiulio  ( 1989)  221\u00ad24,251\u00ad52),whereas  the  border between  Krotoniate  and  Kaulonian  territory  must  remain more  uncertain,  perhaps  to  be  located  somewhere  in  the region  of  Skylletion,  in  which  case  the  territory  would  meas- ure  c. 200  km \u00b2.  There  is  some  archaeological  evidence  for  an ancient  harbour  near  the  estuary  of  the  river  Assi  (Ianelli, Mariottini  and  Lena  ( 1993)).  C 6m\u00adC5m  architectural  fragments  of  about  six  roofs  found  on  the  hill  of  Passoliera c. 1  km  to  the  south  of  Kaulonia  testify  to  an  important  extra- urban  sanctuary  (Barello  ( 1995)  65\u00ad86). A  federation  of  Kaulonia,  Kroton  (no. 56)  and,  presum- ably,  Sybaris  on  the  Traeis  (no. 70.V)  was  established  at  some uncertain  date  in  C 5  with  the  foundation  of  a  federal  sanc- tuary  of  Zeus  Homarios  (Polyb. 2.39.6;  Walbank,  HCP  ad loc.  and  ( 2000)  24).  The  location  of  the  federal  sanctuary  of Zeus  Homarios  is  uncertain,  but  the  sanctuary  of  Punta Stilo  is  one  of  the  more  convincing  suggestions  (infra).  The find of  a  heavy  limestone  cover  from  a  container  in  the  sanc- tuary  has  been  taken  as  evidence  of  a  treasury  or  archive similar  to  that  known  from  Lokroi  (Ianelli  ( 1992a)).  In  C 5s, Kaulonia  was,  with  Taras  (no. 71)  and  Metapontion  (no. 61), involved  in  arbitration  between  Kroton  and  returning  exiles (Iambl.  VP 262). In 389  Kaulonia  was  besieged  and  taken  by  Dionysios  I  of Syracuse  (Diod. 14.103ff),  in  spite  of  help  from  Kroton  and from  the  Italiote  League.  The  citizens  of  Kaulonia  were  relo- cated  to  Syracuse  (no. 47),  granted  citizenship  and  exempt- ed  from  taxes  for  five y ears  (Diod. 14.106.3);  the  city  was razed  to the  ground,  and  the  territory handed  over  to Lokroi italia  and  kampania  265 (no. 59;Diod.  14.106.2).  This  may  perhaps  explain  the  tradition  of  a  Kaulonia  of  the  Lokrians  (Steph.  Byz. 369.19), and  the  tradition  (in  Serv.  Aen. 3.553)  that  Kaulonia  was  a foundation  of  Lokroi.  A  refoundation  c. 357  by Dionysios  II of  Syracuse  may  be  inferred  from  Diod. 16.10.2,  11.3;  cf.  Plut. Dion. 26.7.  The  C 4m\u00ads  circuit  wall  also  implies  a  refounda- tion  (infra). The  Pythagoreans  probably  played  a  political  role  during C 6l\u00adC5f,  but  the  evidence  is  not  very  good  (Dicaearchus  fr. 34,  Wehrli:  Pythagoras  in  Kaulonia;  Iambl.  VP 267:  list  of Pythagoreans  in  Kaulonia).  Nothing  else  is  known  about  the political  organisation,  unless  one  accepts  the  attribution  to  Kaulonia  of  a  C 5e  inscription  (IGSII 20  SEG 471)  testi- fying  to  civic  subdivisions  (Jones,  POAG 168)  and  to  the existence  of  an  eponymous  damiorgos;  its  provenance,  how- ever,  remains  uncertain  (Arena  ( 1996)  no. 52). Kaulonia  was  founded  on  sloping  terrain  facing  the  sea (survey  of  evidence:  Ianelli  ( 1992b)).  There  is  little  archaeo- logical  evidence  for  the  Archaic  or  Classical  city,  but  it extended  inside  the  area  of  the  later  circuit  wall,  possibly  in three  separate  areas,  with  an  early  settlement  on  the  Faro  of Punta  Stilo  and  a  C 6  settlement  extending  as  far  north  as \"Colle  A\"  and  southwards  on  the  Piazzatta  hill;  the  different areas  of  habitation  may  each  have  had  their  own  orienta- tions,  but  the  evidence  is  uncertain  (Orsi  ( 1914);  Tr\u00e9ziny ( 1989)  156).The  well-preserved  circuit  wall  postdates  the  389 destruction  and  is  of  C 4m  or  C 4s  (Tr\u00e9ziny  ( 1989)  155\u00ad57).C6 and  C 5  phases  have  been  investigated  inside  tracts  of  the later  wall.  The  C 6  circuit  wall  probably  had  the  same  north- ern  and  western  (though  not  including  Orsi's  \"Neapolis occidentale\")  extension  as  the  Hellenistic  city.  To  the  south it  remains  uncertain  whether  Orsi's  \"Neapolis  meridionale\" was  part  of  the  Archaic  city.  The  Archaic  walls  therefore delimited  an  area  of  either  35\u00ad36  ha  or  45\u00ad46  ha,  the  latter figure being the e xtent  of  the  Hellenistic  city.  Eastwards,  fac- ing  the  sea,  there  is  evidence  of  a  C 5  (and  C 6?)  circuit  wall (Tr\u00e9ziny  ( 1989),  esp. 129\u00ad32,  156\u00ad57).  The  city  was  refounded after  the  389  destruction,  and  the  remains  of  urban  struc- tures  are  mainly  C 4m  (Ianelli  and  Rizzi  ( 1985)).  Apart  from the  Classical  temple  and  its  Archaic  predecessor,  there  are remains  of  numerous  smaller  naiskoi  and  thesauroi  in  the vast  temenos  at  Punta  Stilo  below  the  city  on  the  coast (Barello  ( 1995)).  The  identity  of  the  deity  honoured  there  is uncertain.  The  main  coin  type  suggests  that  the  chief  divin- ity  of  Kaulonia  was  Apollo  (Lacroix  ( 1965)  159\u00ad61),  possibly with  the  epithet  Daphnephoros  (Caccamo  Caltabiano ( 1990)),  but  see  Giannelli  ( 1963)  179\u00ad82  and  Kraay  ( 1976) 68\u00ad69.  An  alternative  suggestion  is  a  cult  of  Zeus  Homarios established  by  the  Achaian  League  of  Kaulonia,  Kroton  and Sybaris  perhaps  already  in  C 5s  (Torelli  ( 1988)  593);  Osanna ( 1989)  interprets  the  rectangular  theatre-like  structure  in the  temenos  as  the  seat  of  the  Achaian  League,  though  this should  perhaps  rather  be  looked  for  in  neutral  territory (Giannelli  ( 1963)  182\u00ad83).  Substantial  walls,  votives  and architectural  terracottas  on  the  hill  of  the  Faro  di  Punta  Stilo inside  the  urban  area  belong  to  a  major  C 6  sanctuary,  possi- bly  the  earliest  of  Kaulonia  (Barello  ( 1995)  19\u00ad29).  The cemeteries  were  located  outside  the  circuit  wall,  north-west of  the  city  (Orsi  ( 1914)). Dikon  of  Kaulonia  was  a  successful  athlete  who  won  victories  at  all  four  Panhellenic  festivals  (Paus. 6.3.11).  At  his  earlier  victories  he  was  proclaimed  a  Kaulonian (Olympionikai 379  ( 392)),  but  he  was  probably  among  the Kaulonians  relocated  to  Syracuse  by  Dionysios  I  (supra), and  he  was  proclaimed  a  Syrakosios  at  his  subsequent  victo- ries  (Olympionikai 388\u00ad89)  and  is  described  as  such  by  Diod. 15.14.1  (r 384)  (cf.  Stylianou  ( 1998)  ad  loc.). Kaulonia  struck  an  incuse  silver  coinage  from  c. 525,on the  Achaian  standard  (Kraay  ( 1960),  ( 1978);  Rutter,  HN \u00b3 2035ff),  according  to  some  scholars  possibly  from  as  late  as 510  (Montani  Pertosa  ( 1993)).  Initially,  only  staters  were struck,  but  smaller  denominations  were issued  in  the  late incuse  phase.  The  type  (on  which  see  Rutter  ( 1997)  30\u00ad31)  is a  striding,  naked  Apollo  (supra)  with  a  branch  in  his  raised right  hand,  and  on  his  outstretched  left  arm  a  small  running naked  figure holding a similar branch in each hand;  in  a  field a  stag.  Legends  are  the  abbreviated  ethnic,  often  retrograde, ,  (Rutter,  HN \u00b32035\u00ad43;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1698\u00ad1702).A  single  triobol  die  carries  the  earlier  form  of  the name (Kraay  ( 1976)  169;Rutter,  HN \u00b32041).A  double- relief  coinage  was  introduced  480\u00ad475,  with  the  same  obv. type  as  on  the  incuse  coinage;  rev.  stag;  legends: , ,  ;  the  double- relief  coinage  carries  a  complex  system  of  letters  or  symbols (Rutter,  HN \u00b32044ff;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1703\u00ad32).  Similar  types appear  on  some  smaller  denominations  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3 2060ff).  Bronze  coinage  was  issued  from  C 5s:  obv.  head  of horned  river-god  (the  Sagra?);  rev.  stag  (Rutter,  HN \u00b32069). Kaulonian  coinage  comes  to  an  end  with  the  conquest  by Dionysios  I  in  389/8. 56.Kroton  (Krotoniatas) Map  46.  Lat. 39.05,long.  17.05. Size of  territory: 4  (dominion: 5,  infra).

The  city-ethnic  is  (LSAG 104.22  SEG 40  426 ( 510\u00ad470)),  sometimes  spelled  (SEG 11  1211 266 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo ( 525\u00ad500);  coins,  infra), (Thuc. 7.35.2;  Arist. fr. 600.1),  or  (Hdt. 3.137.1). Kroton  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  and  political  senses combined  at  Hdt. 3.137.3,  and  in  Hdt. 8.46.1  it  is  subsumed under  the  heading  polis,  where polis  occurs  in  the  political sense  (Hdt. 8.42.1,  49.1);  Kroton  is  the  third  toponym  listed at  Ps.-Skylax  13  after  the  heading    ,whe re polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense.  The  Aristotelian  collection of  politeiai  seems  to have included  a   (Heracl.  Lemb. 68;  Arist.  fr. 523,  Gigon). The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on coins  from  C 5l  (infra);  the  external  collective use  is  attested in  a  C 6l\u00adC5e  Delphic  inscription  (LSAG 104.22  SEG 40 426),  and  in  SEG 11  1211  (C 5),  Hdt. 3.137.2  and  Thuc. 7.35.2. The  external  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in Hdt. 3.125.1,5.47.1;  CID ii  51.iii.9  ( 339);Arist.Gen.  an. 752b25. Kroton  was  an  Achaian  foundation  (Hdt. 8.47; Peloponnesian  in  Ps.-Skymnos  328;  Spartan  participation (Paus. 3.3.1)  is  a  tradition  probably  no  older  than  the  victory over  Sybaris  and  the  expedition  of  Dorieus  (C 6l)).  The colony  was  founded  in  709/8  (Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 2.59.3; Jer.  Chron.  also  gives  Ol. 17.3,  and  the  foundation  is  here treated  as  contemporary  with  that  of  Sybaris,  as  in  other sources,  e.g.  Strabo  6.2.4,  cf. 6.1.12;  the  Armenian  Eusebios gives  Ol. 17.4,i.e.708/7).A  date  not  long  after  the  foundation of  Syracuse  ( 733)  is  implied  by  Antiochos'  statement  that  the oecist  Myskellos  of  Rhypes  in  Achaia  (cf.  Hippys  (FGrHist 554)  fr. 1)  received  support  from  Archias  the  oecist  of Syracuse  (FGrHist 555,fr.  10).  See  also  Giangiulio  ( 1989) 134\u00ad48  for  a  reappraisal  of  the  Delphic  traditions  and Myskellos.  The  verse  oracles  relating  to  Myskellos  (Diod.  fr. 8.17;  Antiochos  and  Hippys  (locc.  citt.  supra))  are  not  gen- uine  but  \"quasi-historical\"  according  to  Fontenrose  ( 1978) Q 28\u00ad30,Q139\u00ad140.  However,  Delphi  probably  did  play  an important  role  in  the  foundation:  the  Delphic  tripod  is depicted  already  on  the  earliest  Krotoniate  coinage  (infra). Herakles  is  named  as  the  mythical  founder  on  C 5s  coin  leg- ends  (Lacroix  ( 1965)  76\u00ad79  pl. 5.7\u00ad8;  cf.  Diod. 4.24.7  and Heracl.  Lemb. 68).  Cf.  further  Morgan  and  Hall  ( 1996) 206\u00ad8. The  name  of  the  territory  is     at  Hdt. 5.45,  or  simply  (Thuc. 7.35.1;  Alkimos (FGrHist 560)  fr. 2).  To  the  north-east  the  river  Hylias  (modern  Fiumenica?)  formed  the  border  with  the  territory of  Sybaris  (no. 70)/Thourioi  (no. 74)  (Thuc. 7.35.2).  The Lakinian  promontory  and  the  rivers  Aisaros  and  Krimisa may  mark  the  limits  of  the  early  territory.  Later  the  chora  of Kroton  was  delimited  to  the  north  by  the  sanctuary  of Apollo  Alaios,  to  the  south  by  that  of  Hera  Lakinia,  and inland  by  the  adjoining  hills  (Giangiulio  ( 1989)  215\u00ad32).  In  a 1984  survey  238  settlements  and  single  farmsteads  were recorded;  by 450\u00ad350  the  territory  measured  about  270  km \u00b2 (Carter  and  D'Annibale  ( 1984);  Carter  et al.( 1990)). The  tradition  of  Philoktetes  (Apollodorus  (FGrHist 244) fr. 167  Strabo  6.1.3),  and  that  of  the  Krotoniate  possession of  the  bow  of  Herakles  (Mir.  ausc. 840a20),  may  reflect Krotoniate  expansion  or  ambitions  on  the  confines of Sybarite  territory  (Mele  ( 1983a)  36\u00ad39)  or  in  regard  to  the indigenous  populations  (Giangiulio  ( 1991a)  49\u00ad53).  The expansion  of  Kroton  is  indicated  by  the  foundation  of  two colonies  in  C 7:  Kaulonia  (no. 55)  on  the  Ionian  Sea  (Ps.- Skymnos  318\u00ad22),  comprising  also  the  territory  of Skylletion;  and  Terina  (no. 73)  on  the  Tyrrhenian  Sea  (Ps.- Skymnos  306\u00ad7).  The  territorial  ambition  of  Kroton towards  the  south-west  was  blocked  at  the  river  Sagra,  the- atre of  the  C 6m  war  between  Kroton  and  Lokroi  (no. 59) (Strabo  6.1.10)  in  which  Kroton  was  surprisingly  defeated. The  maximum  territorial  expansion  of  Kroton  was  attained after  the  victory  over  Sybaris  c. 510,  and  for  this  period  a Krotoniate  dominion  is  attested  by  coins  with  two  ethnics: in  addition  to  that  of  Kroton,  those  of  Sybaris  (no. 70) ( -),  Pandosia  (no. 64)  ( -) and Temesa  (no. 72)  ( -);  cf.  also  coins  inscribed  - (infra).  As  shown  by  Parise,  this  numismatic  evidence points  not  to  an  alliance  but  to  a  dominion  controlled  by Kroton  (Parise  ( 1982);  cf.  Stazio  ( 1983b)  967\u00ad70).  Kroton may  have  treated  the  cities  in  the  dominion  as  dependencies, since  there  is  evidence  of  a  Krotoniate  governor  (exarchos) at  Sybaris  (Iambl.  VP 74;  Minar  ( 1942)  70).  In  C 5,Kroton opposed  the  refoundation  of  Sybaris  (Diod. 11.90.4,  12.10.2, cf. 11.3)  and  waged  war  against  Thourioi  (no. 74)  with  the help  of  the  Pythagoreans  returning  from  exile  (Polyb. 2.39.4; Iambl.  VP 264).  In  C 5s,  however,  its  dominion  disintegrated (Kahrstedt  ( 1918)  185;  RE  xi. 2024\u00ad25). A  number  of  important  sanctuaries  were  located  in  the territory:  that  of  Hera Lakinia  on  the  promontory  c. 10  km  to the  south  of  Kroton  had  a  C 6  origin  and  had  developed  into a  pan-Italiote  sanctuary  by  C 5l.  The  Classical  temple  was  a major  structure  of  unparalleled  splendour  in  Magna Graecia  (Orsi  ( 1911b);  Spadea  ( 1996)).The  other  major  sanc- tuary  in  the  territory,  at  Cir\u00f2  (Punta  Alice),  is  probably  that of  Apollo  Alaios  founded  by  Philoktetes  (Lycoph.  Alex. 920; dedication  of  the  bow  of  Herakles,  Mir.  ausc. 840a20);  it secured  the  territorial  interests  of  Kroton  southwards (Maddoli  ( 1983)  336;  Musti  ( 1991)  25\u00ad27).  Inland  sanctuaries in  the  chora  of  Kroton  have  been  found  at  Giammiglione italia  and  kampania  267 and  at  S.  Anna  (Spadea  ( 1983)  137\u00ad38;  Osanna  ( 1992) 177\u00ad79).  In  413,  the  city  denied  an  Athenian  army  passage through  the  territory  (Thuc. 7.35.2).  Control  of  the  territory may  also  be  implied  by  Hdt. 5.45.2  mentioning  a  presumably public  grant  of  land  to  Kallias  of  Elis.  A  C 6l  exile  is  attested in  Hdt. 5.47.1;  cf.  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 20.1.7  for  C 5e  exiles. A  C 5s  recall  of  exiles  is  reported  in  Iambl.  VP 263. The  military  forces  of  Kroton  at  the  C 6  battle  on  the  river Sagra  reputedly  numbered  130,000  or 120,000  men  (Strabo 6.1.10;  Just.  Epit. 20.3.4\u00ad5)  and  100,000  men  in  510  (Diod. 12.9.5).  These,  obviously,  are  unreliable  figures,  but  it  seems correct  that,  after  the  victory  over  Sybaris,  Kroton  had  the largest  population  of  the  Greek  cities  in  Italy  (cf.  Diod. 14.103.4  (r 389));  10,000  citizens,  the  estimate  of  Beloch ( 1922)  iii. 1  306\u00ad7,may be correct. Kroton  was  of  Achaian  origin,  but  relations  with  home- land  Achaia  are  almost  invisible  in  our  sources  (Morgan  and Hall ( 1996)  211\u00ad14).  By  C 6m  the  Achaian  cities  of  Italy  seem to  have  formed  an  alliance,  e.g.  in  the  war  against  Siris  (no. 69),  which  was  defeated  by  Kroton  (no. 56),  Metapontion (no. 61)  and  Sybaris  (no. 70.I)  (Just.  Epit. 20.2.4).  In  C 5l, Kroton  with  Kaulonia  (no. 55)  and  Sybaris  on  the  Traeis  (no. 70.V)  organised  the  first I taliote  League  (Polyb. 2.39.5\u00ad6; Walbank  ( 2000)  23\u00ad24),  later  enlarged  or  refounded  in opposition  to  Dionysios  I  of  Syracuse  and  the  Leukanians (Diod. 14.91.1  (r 393),  describing  it  as  a  symmachia  with  a synedrion,  cf. 101.1;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 230).  However,  Dionysios' victory  on  the  river  Eleporos  in  389  was  followed  by  a  twelve- year  period  of  dependency  on  the  tyrant  of  Syracuse  (Dion. Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 20.7). In 356/5,  a citizen  of  Kroton  served  as  theorodokos  of Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.195.42);  IG ii\u00b2  406  (C 4s)  is  pos- sibly  a  fragment  of  a  grant  of  proxeny  for  a  Krotoniate. Reception  of  envoys  is  attested  in  Diod. 12.9.3  (rC 6l). Sending  of  envoys  is  reported  in  Phylarchos  (FGrHist 81)  fr. 45  (rC 6l)  and  Iambl.  VP 263  (rC 5s). The  constitution  of  Kroton  is  known  only  from  late sources  of  doubtful  value,  principally  Iamblichos'  De  Vita Pytagorica  of  the  third  to  fourth  century  ad.  It  was  aristo- cratic/oligarchic  until  C 5m  (Iambl.  VP 255),  from  C 6l  to C 5m  seemingly  under  strong  Pythagorean  influence (Minar ( 1942)  1\u00ad71),  though  both  democratic  and  tyrannical  inter- ludes  are  recorded.  A  gerousia  with  its  archeion  as  well  as archontes  are  attested  for  C 6l  (Dicaearchus  fr. 33,  Wehrli; Timaeus  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 44;  cf.  Iambl.  VP 126:  archeion  of the 1,000),  but  such  constitutional  details  are  all  that  is known  (Minar  ( 1942)  8),  though  it  may  be  inferred  from  the democratic  revolution  of  C 6l  (infra)  that,  e.g.,  access  to offices was denied the demos.  A  meeting  of  the  ekklesia  is attested  for  C 6l  (Diod. 12.9.4);  the  synkletos,  which  in  con- nection  with  this  meeting  is  distinguished  from  the  demos (ibid.),  may  possibly  be  identical  with  either  the  gerousia  or with  the  \" 1,000\",  a  body  attested  in  Iambl.  VP 45,  126  (rC 6l). For  the  interpretation  of  the  1,000  as  the  original  Archaic assembly,  see  Sartori  ( 1953)  116  and  Ghinatti  ( 1996)  82\u00ad86. Another  possibility  is  that  the  1,000  were  a/the  council  (Val. Max. 8.12.15.  Ext. 1;  cf.  Minar  ( 1942)  8).  Democracy  was introduced  in  C 6l  (Robinson  ( 1997)  76)  (shortly  after  the victory  over  Sybaris,  since  one  of  the  causes  of  the  revolu- tion  reported  by Iambl.  VP 255  was  dissatisfaction  with  the arrangements  proposed  for  the  conquered  Sybarite  land) after  a  violent  uprising  against  the  Pythagoreans  (Iambl.  VP 257\u00ad62);  the  initial  demands  for  reform  included  popular access  to  magistracies  and  assemblies,  and  euthynai  of  offi- cials  by  representatives  chosen  by  lot     (ibid. 257); some  of  these  constitutional  demands  may  have  been  met (Minar  ( 1942)  56).  After  the  final democratic v ictory  there followed  sentences  of  exile,  a  redistribution  of  land  and  a cancellation  of  debts  (Iambl.  VP 262),  though  these  meas- ures  have  been  thought  to  have  occurred  only  in  C 5m (Minar  ( 1942)  57\u00ad60);  see  also  Robinson  ( 1997)  76\u00ad77,who accepts  the  whole  account  as  referring  to  C 6l.  A  tyrant, Kleinias,  is  with  some  uncertainty  dated  to  C 5e  (Minar ( 1942)  72;  Luraghi  ( 1994)  72\u00ad75).  All  that  is  known  of  him  is that  he  secured  his  tyranny  with  the  aid  of  exiles  (presum- ably  non-Krotoniate)  and  slaves,  and  proceeded  to  execute and  exile  the  epiphanestatoi;  he  may  also  have  brought  other poleis  under  his  sway  (Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 20.7.1);  his  revolt seems  to  have  been  against  a  reconstituted  oligarchy  (cf. epiphanestatoi),  though  it  is  not  known  how  it  replaced  the C 6l  democracy  (Berger  ( 1992)  20).  A  prytanis  is  attested  in C 5e  (Ath. 522C);  the  office of  strategos  is  attested  as  well (Kratinos  fr. 223,  Kock).  Oligarchs  were in  power  again  in C 5m,when  the  Pythagoreans  were overthrown,  but  the  con- stitutional  history  after  Kleinias  is  obscure  (Minar  ( 1942) 73ff). Kroton  was  founded  on  a  coastal  plain,  delimited  on  one side  by  the  Castello  hill,  the  acropolis  of  the  ancient  city. There  is  no  clear  evidence  of  a  pre-Greek  indigenous  settle- ment  (Sabbione  ( 1982)  251,  259),  but  according  to  Ephor.  fr. 140  it  had  been  inhabited  by  Iapygians.  A  C 4\u00adC2  circuit  wall is  known  from  various  locations  along  the  hills  delimiting the  urban  centre.  The  morphology  of  the  Collina  del  Castello and  the  S.  Lucia  hills  suggests  a  coherent  fortification system similar  to  Euryalos  at  Syracuse.  The  C 4  evidence  suggests  a continuous  circuit  (cf.  the  siege  of 317  reported  in  Diod. 268 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo 19.3.3),  the  river  Aisaros  being  fortified along the banks or/and  with  chains  across  the  river,  in  all  13  km  in  length  (cf. Livy  24.3.1).  The  fortified area c omprised  c. 620  ha  (cf.  Diod. 21.4  (r 295));  Livy  23.30.7  refers  to an  arx,  probably  the  acrop- olis  comprising  the  S.  Lucia  hills  (Spadea  ( 1983)  158\u00ad61). The  evidence  suggests  that  the  Greek  colonists  settled simultaneously  over  the  whole  of  the  later  urbanised  area, from  the  acropolis  near  the  coast  to  the  north  circuit  wall, i.e.  including  the  area  north  of  the  river  Aisaros.  The  charac- ter  of  the  urban  layout  in  the  different  zones  suggests  an  ini- tial  settlement  pattern  organised  in  several  kleroi  (Spadea ( 1983)  124\u00ad27;Lattanzi  ( 1988)  554).The  earliest  urban  organ- isation  with  a  regular  layout  has  a  C 7l\u00adC6e  origin.  There  are indications  that  Kroton  was  provided  with  a  new  town  plan after  Dionysios'  defeat  of  the  Italiote  League  at  the  river Eleporos  in  389,  but  the  alterations  relative  to  earlier  grid systems  are  unclear  (Spadea  ( 1983)  152\u00ad54).  The  harbour mentioned  by  Strabo  ( 6.1.12)  may  have  been  located  on  the estuary  of  either  the  river  Aisaros  or  the  river  Neaithos. According  to Diod. 12.9.3,  Sybarite  exiles  sought  refuge  at altars  in  the  agora  c. 510  (cf.  Hdt. 3.137.1). The  archaeological  evidence  for  urban  sanctuaries  is  lim- ited  to the  C 6  Hera  Eleutheria(?)  sanctuary  \"Vigna  Nuova\" on  the  outskirts  of  the  city  (Spadea  ( 1983)  144\u00ad50)  bridging polis  and  chora  (Lattanzi  ( 1981)  224\u00ad25).  Other  urban  sanc- tuaries,  however,  are  indicated  by  sporadic  finds of  C 7\u00adC6 architectural  terracottas  (Spadea  ( 1983)  136\u00ad37).  A  cult  of Zeus  Soter  is  inferred  from  coin  legends  (infra),  and  the  seat of  the  Achaian  League  in  the  sanctuary  of  Zeus  Homarios has  tentatively  been  located  in  the  sanctuary  of  Hera  Lakinia (De  Sensi  Sestito  ( 1982b)).  A  festival  at  Kroton  with  mone- tary  prizes  is  mentioned  in  Timaios  (FGrHist 566)  45  (rC 6l); cf.,  however,  Ath. 522A  with  Dunbabin  ( 1948)  370. Remains  of  an  ashlar  structure  in  the  area  of  the  Nuova Vigna  is  interpreted  as  part  of  a  theatre of  uncertain  date (Cristofani  ( 1970)  269),  but  structural  remains  of  a  theatre have  not  been  substantiated  (Todisco  ( 1990)  149\u00ad51).  A  the- atre  used  for  public  games  is  mentioned  by  Iambl.  VP 126 (rC 5?).  Kroton's  major  cemetery  on  the  Carrara  hill,  delim- iting  the  city  on  its  eastern  side,  goes  back  to  C 8l.  The  house of  the  athlete  Astylos  who  had  himself  proclaimed  as  a Syracusan  after  victories  at  Olympia  was  on  that  account turned  into  a  prison  (Paus. 6.13.1  (r 480s);  Hansen  ( 2002) 36\u00ad37). Attested  cults  include  those  of  Hera Lakinia  (LSAG 261 no. 21  (C 6s);  Diod. 13.3.4),  with  an  important  festival  (Mir. ausc. 96),  Apollo  (Mir.  ausc. 109;  Iambl.  VP 261;  cf.  also coinage,  infra),  the  Muses  (Iambl.  VP 264),  Demeter (Timaeus  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 131)  and  Zeus  Meilichios  (SEG 17 42  (C 6\u00adC5)). Participation  in  the  games  at  Olympia  is  attested  from  672 to 480. ", "Hyele": "Identifier: 55. , was  founded  on  a  coastal  plateau,  more  prominent in  antiquity  when  the  coastline  reached  further  inland  on both  sides  of  the  promontory.  The  city  comprised  four  main zones  (overview:  Krinzinger  ( 1994)):  (a)  the  acropolis,  at first used for habitation and later the site of  Hyele's  main cults;  (b)  the  western  slope  of  the  acropolis,  \"Weststadt\", divided  from  the  main  urban  zone  (c)  by  the  north\u00adsouth circuit  wall  (\"Krinzinger-wall-B\"),  and  protected  on  the north  by  \"wall-A\";  (c)  the  main  urban  zone  in  the  southern plain,  \"S\u00fcdstadt\"  (\"Unterstadt\")  and  Vignale  (\"Oststadt\"), protected  westwards  by  \"wall-C\",  northwards  by  \"wall-A\", and  southwards  towards  the  coast  by  \"wall-E\";  (d)  a  smaller zone  on  the  north  slope,  \"Nordstadt\",  protected  by  a  sepa- rate  circuit  wall,  \"wall-D\"  (Krinzinger  ( 1979),  ( 1986)).  The whole  site  was  fortified c. 520  shortly  after  the  foundation, but  obviously  not  fully  urbanised,  thus  offering  plenty  of space  for  farming  and  husbandry.  The  division  of  the  city into  quarters  by diateichismata  walls  goes  back  to  the  early history  of  the  site,  suggesting  some  sort  of  social  division  or a  division  based  upon  different  functions  such  as  habita- tion,  commerce  or  workshops  (survey  of  research:  Gassner and  Sokolicek  ( 2000)  95\u00ad97).  The  circuit  wall  follows  the crest  of  the  hill  from  the  acropolis  to  the  top  of  Casteluccio, whence  it  turns  southwards  to  incorporate  a  large  part  of  the southern  plain  to  the  coast.  The  walls  run  for  c. 4  km  and enclose  an  area  of  c. 64  ha,  comprising  the  \"Nordstadt\";  but during  the  early  history  of  the  site  the  habitation  area  was probably  confined t o  the  acropolis  and  the  adjacent  hill,  and covered c. 9  ha.  The  walls  were  of  sun-dried  brick  upon  a foundation  of  local  sandstone  in  polygonal  masonry.  The C 5e  witnessed  a  monumentalisation  of  the  early  structure, with  the  use  of  accurate  ashlar  masonry  and  with  towers raised  at  intervals  of  about  40\u00ad60  m,  the  upper  structures still  in  sun-dried  bricks,  with  a  C 5  course  that  comprised also  the  \"Unterstadt\"  (Gassner  and  Sokolicek  ( 2000)).  A third  phase  in  C 4\u00adC3  saw  various  repairs  and  reinforce- ments  (Krinzinger  ( 1979),  ( 1986)).  The  Archaic  habitation, or  \"polygonal  phase\",  is  known  above  all  from  the  acropolis and  its  southern  slope.  The  urban  aspect  is  irregular,  but there  is  some  evidence  of  orthogonal  planning,  with  a plateia  along  the  south  flank of  the  acropolis,  cutting obliquely  into  the  hill,  and  houses  laid  out  on  terraces  on both  sides  of  short  stenopoi.  On  the  acropolis  the  streets were  laid  out  not  orthogonally  but  in  accordance  with  the morphology  of  the  terrain.  The  lower  wall  structures  are  in local  sandstone  in  a  polygonal  technique,  whereas  the  upper structures  are  in  sun-dried  brick;  there  is  evidence  of  a  water supply  and  drainage  (Velia  iii;  Krinzinger  and  Gassner ( 1997)).  A  large  residential  building,  perhaps  a  ruler's  house from  C 6l,  was  located  further  along  the  crest  of  the  hill (Bencivenga  Trillmich  1983).  The  lower  city,  \"S\u00fcdstadt\",  was also  extensively  occupied  from  the  Archaic  period,  and  there is  evidence  of  urban  planning  from  the  C 6l\u00adC5e  phase (Krinzinger  ( 1992\u00ad93)  29\u00ad37).  The  Vignale  zone  in  the  lower city  reveals  urban  organisation  and  orthogonal  layout  of  the per  strigas  type  from  C 5m  (Krinzinger  ( 1992\u00ad93);  Krinzinger et al.( 1999)).  The  morphology  of  the  site  may  have  favoured a  system  of  habitation  on  terraces,  a  system  of  urbanisation well  known  in  the  Ionian  cities,  such  as  Ephesos  and  others. The  cavea  structure  under  the  C 3  and  later  Roman  theatre has,  without  substantial  evidence,  been  interpreted  as  the remains  of  a  bouleuterion  of  c. 470\u00ad460  (Bencivenga  Trillmich ( 1994)  93\u00ad94).A  Greek  phase  of  the  Roman  theatre  is  perhaps evidenced by a C 5e  polygonal  analema  wall  (ibid. 90\u00ad92).In  a later  phase  the  cavea  may  have  had  a  wooden  covering,  ikria (ibid. 89\u00ad90,92\u00ad93).The  Archaic  habitation  structures  on  the acropolis  gave  way  to  a  monumental  temenos  probably already  by  the  late  Archaic  period  (for  a  survey  of  the  archae- ological  evidence  for  sanctuaries  at  Hyele,  see  Hinz  ( 1998)  180 n. 1046).  A  large  quasi-isodomic  terrace  wall  (\"Ionic- Lemnian  technique\")  gave  space  for  a  C 5e  Ionic  temple,  prob- ably  of  Athena  Polias  (Bencivenga  Trillmich  ( 1990)  371  n. 26; Miranda  ( 1982)).  The  terrace  north-east  of  the  temple  with the  sanctuary  of  Poseidon  Asphaleios  (Guarducci  ( 1966) 280\u00ad82)  is  part  of  this  reorganisation  of  the  acropolis.  The foundations  of  a  C 6  cult  building  on  the  western  extremity  of the  acropolis  in  conjunction  with  votive  material  and  inscrip- tions  are  all  taken  as  evidence  of  a  cult  of  Hera going  back  to the  foundation  of  the  city  (Tocco  Sciarelli  ( 1997)  228\u00ad29). Another  sanctuary,  situated  further  along  on  the  crest  north- east  of  the  acropolis,  with  an  open  paved  space  with  stoas  on three  sides,  is  attributed  to  Poseidon  Asphaleios  by  a  C 4m inscription  (Guarducci  ( 1966)  280\u00ad82).  A  well-built  ashlar temenos  wall  and  steps  of  access  on  the  north  slope  belong  to a  C 5  sanctuary  of  Zeus,  identified b y  a  C 5m  cippus (Krinzinger  ( 1994)  37,  54  n. 52\"Zeus  Agoraios\";  LSAG 464  E); Miranda  takes  the  Zeus  inscriptions  from  the  \"Altar-terrasse\" as  evidence  of  a  Zeus  Polieus  cult  (Miranda  ( 1982)  171\u00ad72;  cf. IGDGG  no. 53).  The  C 5  cemetery  was  possibly  laid  out  on  the top  of  Castelluccio  (Bencivenga  Trillmich  ( 1990)  369\u00ad70),but the  evidence  is  meagre.  Early  excavation  maps  indicate  a cemetery  outside  the  south  wall  (\"section  E\"),  between  the city  and  coast. Hyele  began  minting  silver  coins  on  the  Phokaian  stand- ard  in  C 6s,  with  issues  of  drachms,  diobols  and,  possibly, obols  and  eighth-obols  (Williams  ( 1992)):  obv.  forepart  of  a 264 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo lion  devouring  its  prey;  rev.  an  incuse  pattern.  No  legends name  the  mint,  but  the  attribution  to  Hyele  rests  on  both provenance  and  obv.  type  (Rutter,  HN \u00b31259\u00ad63;  SNG  Cop. Italy 1521\u00ad22).  The  so-called  auriol-class  of  diobols  are  less certainly  attributed  to Hyele  (Rutter  ( 1997)  33;  cf.  IGCH 2352).  A  new  series  from  c. 465  consists  of  didrachms  on  the Italic\u00adTarantine  standard  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  p. 118):  obv.  lion roaring,  rev.  head  of  the  nymph  Hyele;  legend:  (cf.  Masson,  REG 108  ( 1995)  231), , ,  at  times  retrograde,  at  first on obv.  in  exer- gue,  later  on  rev.(Rutter,  HN \u00b3  1264;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1523\u00ad26); later  types:  obv.  female  head;  rev.  lion  (SNG  Cop.  Italy 1527\u00ad28).  Lower  denominations  from  c. 465:  drachms, diobols  and  obols:  obv.  head  of  the  nymph  Hyele,  the  dies  of the  drachms  marked  with  a  letter  in  an  alphabetical sequence;  rev.  owl;  legend: (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  1265\u00ad67; SNG  Cop.  Italy 1529\u00ad34).  After  C 5m,  didrachms  of  a  more advanced  style  were  introduced:  obv.  Athena  wearing  richly ornamented  Attic  helmet  similar  to  the  type  at  Thourioi; rev.  lion  seizing  stag;  legends  as  above  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  1270; SNG  Cop.  Italy 1535\u00ad37);  the  drachms,  diobols  and  obols have  the  same  types  as  before.  This  series  too  has  letters  in  an alphabetical  sequence.  Various  silver  issues  were  continued from  C 4e  into  Cl:  rev.  lion  crouching  (Rutter,  HN \u00b31277ff; SNG  Cop.  Italy 1538\u00ad92);  sophisticated  dies  depict  the  head of  Athena  en face  and  with  the  signature  perhaps  of  the engravers  (SNG  Cop.  Italy 1560);  the  obv.  type  sometimes depicts  Athena  in  Phrygian  helmet  (Rutter,  HN \u00b31291,  1295). Bronze  coinage  was  introduced  in  C 5s:  obv.  head  of  nymph, or  of  Herakles;  rev.owl (Rutter,  HN \u00b31320\u00ad21;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1554\u00ad55).  Later  bronze  types:  obv.  head  of  Herakles,  or Athena,  or  Zeus;  rev.  lion,  or  owl,  or  tripod;  legends  as  above (Libero  Mangieri  ( 1986)  116\u00ad23;Rutter,  HN \u00b31325ff;  SNG Cop.  Italy 1593\u00ad1611).  The  late  silver  and  bronze  issues  indi- cate  cults  of  Athena,  Apollo,  Zeus  and  Herakles  in  addition to  that  of  the  nymph  Hyele  (Breglia  ( 1966);  Ebner  ( 1978); Williams  ( 1992)). 55.

Byz. 615.2 gives  the  city-ethnic  as \u00b5  and  this  form  is  found in  Callim.  Aet.fr. 85.10,  Pfeiffer,  and  may  be  abbreviated  as and on  C 6\u00adC5  coins  (infra)  unless  the  legends abbreviate  the  toponym.  For  the  location  of  Temesa,  still not  resolved,  at  Casalina  di  S.  Sosti  or  further  southwards  at Fiumefreddo  Bruzio,  see  Massaro  ( 1982)  22  with  refs. Recently  sporadic  archaeological  evidence  has  been  investi- gated  on  the  fertile  plain  of  Campora  S.  Giovanni  near  the coast  in  the  Savuto  valley,  but  the  evidence  is  inconclusive, though  the  cultural  assemblage  is  indeed  C 6s\u00adC5fGreek (De  Sensi  Sestito  and  Valentini  ( 1990)  esp. 137\u00ad42).  Spadea (followed  by  Barr.)  argues  for  a  location  at  the  Piano della  Tirena,  where  the  urban  remains  include  parts  of a  circuit  wall  and  habitation.  However,  these  are  mainly C 4  and  therefore  belong  primarily  to  the  Oskan-Brettian- Hellenistic  period  (Spadea  ( 1990a)),  leaving  the  location of  the  Archaic  city  still  unresolved  (E.  Greco  ( 1986) 129\u00ad30,  with  reference  also  to  the  analogous  case  of Laos). Temesa  is  called  polis  only  by  late  sources  (Strabo  6.1.5; Steph.  Byz. 615.1;  Paus. 6.6.11);  however,  its  C 6\u00adC5  coinage (infra)  suggests  that  it  was  a  polis  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical 302 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo periods,  albeit  probably  mostly  a  dependency  of  larger  poleis (infra). According  to  Strabo  6.1.5,  Temesa  was  a  foundation  of  the Ausonians,  and  the  settlement  accordingly  was  originally not  Greek  but  indigenous.  A  later  Greek  or  Hellenising phase  is,  however,  suggested  by  the  tradition  of  heroic colonisation  by  Aitolians  led  by  Thoas,  who  in  their  turn were  later  ousted  by  Brettians  (Strabo  6.1.5).  This  tradition may  be  connected  with  the  activities  of  Alexander  the Molossian  in  South  Italy  (Biraschi  ( 1982)  36\u00ad37).  Other Greek  traditions  are  that  of  Polites,  a  companion  of Odysseus,  who  had  a  heroon  near  Temesa  (Strabo  6.1.5;  cf. Mele  ( 1983b)),  and  that  of  the  Olympic  victor  Euthymos  of Lokroi  who  fought  this  Polites  when  the  Lokrians  had  captured  the  city  (Strabo  6.1.5;  cf.  Paus. 6.6.4\u00ad11  for  a  variant of  the  myth,  referring  also  to  a  painting  depicting  personifi- cations  of  the  young  Sybaris  and  of  the  polis  of  Temesa). Greek  identity  is  suggested  also  by  the  Greek-style  coinage (infra).  All  these  elements  suggest  that  Temesa  was  an Oinotrian  city  (schol.  Hom.  Od. 1.184),  strongly  Hellenised, prior  to 510  within  the  dominion  of  Sybaris  (no. 70.I)  and after  510  in  the  dominion  of  Kroton  (no. 56),and  from  c. 480, some  time  after  the  Medmean,  Hipponian  and  Lokrian defeat  of  Kroton,  in  the  dominion  of  Lokroi  (no. 59). The  territories  of  Temesa  and  Terina  (at  S.  Eufemia Vetere(?),  cf.  Terina  (no. 73))  were  adjacent  (Strabo  6.1.5); Temesa  is  often  located  in  the  area  of  the  estuary  of  the  river Savuto,  ancient  Sabutus  (supra).  Sybaris  controlled  the  val- leys  of  the  rivers  Krathis  and  Sabutus  and  the  access  to  the Tyrrhenian  Sea,  and  so  Temesa  may  have  been  within Sybaris'  dominion.  After  Kroton's  victory  over  Sybaris, Temesa  seems  to have become  a  part  of  Kroton's dominion, as  indicated  by  its  coinage  (infra).  It  was  later  held  by  Lokroi, as  suggested  by  the  traditions  associated  with  Euthymos (supra);  numismatic  evidence  dates  Lokrian  control  to  C 5m (infra),  whereas  dates  based  upon  written  evidence  point rather  to c. 480,  in  which  case  it  was  followed  by  a  new  peri- od  of  Krotoniate  influence (see De Sensi Sestito ( 1982a)  for  a full  discussion). Temesa  with  Kroton  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Achaian standard.  Initially,  i.e.  C 6l,  it  was  an  incuse  coinage  with  the tripod  of  Kroton  and  legends  in  the  Achaian  script:  (sometimes  retrograde)  and  ,  one  issue  with  the  rev. type:  flying eagle,  contemporary  with  the  \"dominion- coinage\"  of  Kroton  (see  the  entry  for  Kroton,  infra;  Stazio ( 1982)  96\u00ad99;  Parise  ( 1982)  107\u00ad10,(1990a);  Rutter,  HN \u00b3 p. 167);dumpy  flan incuse issues (similar t ype  and  legend)  of c. 480  are  also  known  (Stazio  ( 1982)  98).  From  C 5m  Temesa struck  double-relief  staters:  obv.tripod of  Kroton;  rev. Corinthian  helmet,  the  emblem  of  Temesa,  legend: or on  obv.  and  rev.  (Stazio  ( 1982)  94\u00ad95,  99;Rutter,  HN \u00b3 2566;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1828).A  Krotoniate  C 5s  issue  of  double- relief  staters  has  obv.  tripod,  legend ,  rev.  Corinthian helmet,  legend  ;  lower  denominations  are  without  , but  the  rev.  type  ensures  their  attribution  to  this  group (Stazio  ( 1982)  96;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  2122\u00ad24).  The  affiliation of Temesa  to  Kroton  is  clear  and  the  evidence  suggests  that Temesa  was  part  of  the  Krotoniate  dominion  from  C 6l, though  from  C 5m  less  dependent  upon  Kroton,  as  possibly reflected in the t radition  of  Lokrian  influence ( supra; Prontera ( 1982)  42,  47;  De  Sensi  Sestito  and  Valentini ( 1990)). 73.

The  external  collective use  is  attested in  SEG 11  1205  (c. 500),  SEG 24  303\u00ad5  (C 6\u00adC5),  ML  63.12 ( 433/2),  Hdt. 7.170.3  and  Thuc. 6.44.3;  the  external  individ- ual  use  is  found  in  SEG 48  1252  (c. 550\u00ad500),  CEG i 388  (c. 450\u00ad425),  Arist.

Rhegion  was  a  colony  of  Chalkis  (no. 365)  (Thuc. 6.44.3; Ps.-Skymnos  311\u00ad12;Diod.  14.40.1;Strabo 6.1.6),  and Euboian  involvement  in  the  foundation  is  supported  by  cal- endar  evidence  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 43\u00ad44);  Peloponnesian Messenians  also  participated  in  the  foundation  according  to Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 9  and  Heracl.  Lemb. 55. According  to Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 9,  the  Zanklaians (no. 51)  sent  for  the  colonists  and  appointed  the  oikistes Antimnestos.  The  participation  of  Messenian  refugees  from the  First  Messenian  War  dates  the  foundation  to  C 8s  (CAH \u00b2 iii. 3.323\u00ad24).According  to  Dion.  Hal.  Ant.  Rom. 19.2,the  city was  founded  by  Artimedes  of  Chalkis.  By  the  Classical  peri- od  there  existed  a  well-developed  foundation  myth (Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 9;  Heracl.  Lemb. 55). On  the  Ionian  coast  along  the  river  Halex  (cf.  Cordiano ( 1995b))  Rhegion  was  bounded  by  the  territory  of  Lokroi (no. 59),  and  on  the  Tyrrhenian  coast  by  the  river  Petrace and  the  territory  of  Metauros  (no. 62)  (Costamagna  ( 1986) 479\u00ad84  fig. 1).  The  territory  is  termed  at  Thuc. 4.24.2;  its name  was  `  (Thuc. 7.35.2).  The  site  of  Rhegion  is perhaps  the  only  site  with  agricultural  resources  on  the southern  Aspromonte,  and  these  were exploited  from  C 7; 290 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo the  walled  site  of  Serro  di  Tavola  is  interpreted  as  a  C 6s phrourion  in  control  of  inland  routes  and  the  Tyrrhenian coast  (Costamagna  ( 1986)  495\u00ad502;  Cordiano  ( 1995b)  83\u00ad88, 104\u00ad7).  An  extra-urban  cult  of  Herakles  is  attested  by  a  C 5f inscription  from  Castellace,  south  of  Metauros  (IGDGG  no. 41;  Givigliano  ( 1987)  95;  Cordiano  ( 1995b)  103\u00ad4);  evidence of  a  Demeter  cult  at  Gruf\u00f2  Saline  Ioniche  is  offered  by  a  C 5s inscription  (IGDGG  no. 42;  for  Demeter  in  Rhegian  territo- ry,  see  Hinz  ( 1998)  169\u00ad70).An  estimate  of  the  size  of  the  ter- ritory  is  still  largely  based  upon  the  evidence  presented  by Vallet ( 1958)  133\u00ad37,  who  estimated  it  at  c. 1,000\u00ad1,300  km \u00b2 (cf.  Cordiano  ( 1995b)).  The  influence of  Rhegion  extended over  a  much  larger  area,  as  shown  by  the  foundation  of Pyxous  (no. 67)  c. 476\u00ad465  (Diod. 11.59.4;Strabo 6.1.1)  and the  pressure  on  Lokrian  territorial  aspirations  (cf.  Cordiano ( 1995b)  esp. 92\u00ad94). Rhegion  was  presumably  a  member  of  the  Italiote  League (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 230).  The  city  was  allied  to  Lokroi  (no. 59)  at the  battle  of  Sagra  in  C 6  (Strabo  6.1.10),  but  war  between  it and  Lokroi  is  attested  during  the  reign  of  Anaxilas  (schol. Pind.  Pyth. 1.99a,  2.36c,  Drachmann).  An  alliance  with  Taras (no. 71)  in  473  is  implied  by  Hdt. 7.170.3,  who  reports  that 3,000  Rhegians  fell  in  a  battle  fought  by  the  Rhegians  and  the Tarantines  against  Iapygians  (cf.  Diod. 11.52.3\u00ad4,  who  calls the  Rhegians  symmachoi  of  Taras).  IGDGG  no. 38  (c. 450)  is  a kerykeion  inscribed  ;ML  63  (  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 162)  is  a  433/2  renewal  of  an  alliance  with  Athens  (no. 361) originally  concluded  in  the  440s;  in  415,  however,  the  city refrained  from  supporting  the  Athenian  effort  against Syracuse  (Thuc. 6.44.3,  46.2;Diod.  13.3.5),  though  it  did make  a  payment  to  Athens  (IG i\u00b3  291.b.ii.19  (c. 415)).  A  sym- machia  with  Leontinoi  (no. 33)  in  427  is  attested  by  Thuc. 3.86.3.  A  peace  treaty  with  Dionysios  I  of  Syracuse  was  con- cluded  in  399  (Diod. 14.40.7;  cf. 14.90.7)  and  in  389  (Diod. 14.107.4)  when  the  city  had  to  surrender  its  navy,  pay  300  tal., and  turn  over  100  hostages  to  Dionysios.  Rhegion  was  taken and  destroyed  by Dionysios  I  of  Syracuse  in  387  (Diod. 14.111\u00ad12),  who  sold  off  as  slaves  those  inhabitants  who  were not  able  to  raise  a  ransom  of  one  silver  mina.  The  city  was refounded  by  his  son  Dionysios  II,  and  a  part  of  the  city  was for  a  short  period  called  by  the  name  of  Phoibia  (Strabo 6.1.6).  The  independence  of  Rhegion  was  restored  by Leptines  and  Kallipos  of  Syracuse  in  351  (Diod. 16.45.9). In C 5s,  Rhegion  experienced  a  period  of  stasis  (Thuc. 4.1.3),  and  there  were  Rhegian  phygades  at  Lokroi  urging that  city  to  invade  Rhegian  territory  (Thuc. 4.1.3). According  to  Hdt. 7.170.3,  Rhegion  lost  3,000  men  in  bat- tle  against  the  Iapygians  in  473  (cf.  Diod. 11.52.3\u00ad4).An  army of 6,000  foot, 600  horse  and  fifty t riremes  was  deployed  in 399  (Diod. 14.40.3).  In  427  and 425,  Rhegian  naval  forces assisted  the  Athenian  operations  in  the  west  (Diod. 12.54.4; Thuc. 4.25.2).  In  C 4e,  Rhegion  possessed  a  navy  comprising seventy  triremes  (Diod. 14.107.4;  cf. 14.8.2;  14.40.3),  but  the city  was  stripped  of  its  navy  by  Dionysios  I  in  389  (Diod. 14.106.3).  Appointment  of  strategoi  is  mentioned  at  Diod. 14.40.3  (r 399)  (cf. 14.87.1  (r 394)),  and  14.108.4  (r 388)  indi- cates  that  such  appointments  were  made  by  election. Sending  of  envoys  is  attested  by  Thuc. 3.86.3  (cf.  ML  63.1) and  by Diod. 14.40.7  (r 399),  106.2  (r 389).  Reception  of envoys  is  attested  in  Diod. 14.8.2  (r 404)  and  44.4\u00ad6  (r 398). Diplomatic  activity  is  further  attested  by  the  C 5m  kerykeion (supra).  Two  or  more  citizens  are  listed  as  proxenoi  of  Tenos (no. 525)  in  IG xii  Suppl. 313.7  (C 3m).According  to  Arist.  Pol. 1274b23,  Androdamas  of  Rhegion  at  an  unknown  date (Zahrnt  ( 1971)  16  n. 27)  served  the  Thraceward  Chalkidians as  nomothetes.  A  citizen  of  Rhegion  served  as  theorodokos  of Epidauros  (no. 348)  in  356/5  (IG iv\u00b2.195.47). The  constitution  preceding  the  tyranny  of  Anaxilas  is described  as  an  oligarchy  at  Arist.  Pol. 1316a35ff.  It is  presum- ably  this  constitution  that  is  referred  to in  Heracl.  Lemb. 55: it  is  described  as  an  aristocracy  employing  the  laws  of Charondas  and  administered  by  1,000  men     \u00b5\u00b5.According to Antiochos (FGrHist  555)  fr. 9,  the Rhegian  \u00b5  (  the 1,000?)  were all  of  Messenian genos  in  this  period.  In  494  the  constitution  changed  \"from oligarchy  to  the  tyranny  of  Anaxilas\"  (Arist.  Pol. 1316a37f). Anaxilas  conquered  Zankle  (no. 51)  and  changed  its  name  to Messana  (Hdt. 6.23.2;  Thuc. 6.4.6);  he  was  then  tyrant  of both  Rhegion  and  Zankle/Messana  (Diod. 11.48.2;Berve ( 1967)  156):  Rhegion  was  governed  by  his  son  Leophron while  he  himself  ruled  Zankle/Messana  (schol.  Pind.  Pyth. 2.38).After  the  battle  of  Himera  in  480  he  concluded  a  treaty with  Gelon  and  was  left  in  possession  of  Messana  (schol. Pind.  Pyth. 1.112).  At  the  death  of  Anaxilas  in  476  Mikythos succeeded  to  the  tyranny  (Diod. 11.48.2)  both  at  Rhegion and  Zankle/Messana  (Diod. 11.59.4).  In  465  the  sons  of Anaxilas  took  over  power  from  Mikythos,  but  they  were soon  expelled  and  Rhegion  was  \"liberated\"  (Diod. 11.76.5 (r 461)).C5s  Rhegion  went  through  a  period  of  stasis  culmin- ating  in  425  (Thuc. 4.1.3;  Berger  ( 1992)  29\u00ad30).  Four  nomo- thetai  are  mentioned  in  Iambl.  VP 172  (cf. 130  referring  to them  as  composers  of  a  politeia  (r  c.C 5m):  Minar  ( 1942)  48, 85).  A  meeting  of  the  ekklesia  is  attested  for  398  by Diod. 14.44.5  (cf.  Arist.  Oec. 1349b18;Ael.  VH 5.20)  and  again  for 345/4  (Diod. 16.68.5);  for  a  survey  of  strategoi  and  assemblies in  C 4f,  see  Costabile  ( 1978). italia  and  kampania  291 Rhegion  was  founded  on  a  narrow  sloping  plateau  near the  sea  between  the  river  Calopinace  (ancient  Apsias)  and the  river  Annunciata.  It  was  one  of  the  early  Chalkidian foundations,  probably  founded  shortly  after  Naxos  and Zankle  ( 730\u00ad720)  as  corroborated  by  C 8l  and  C 7  ceramic finds,  structural  evidence  being  absent  (Sabbione  ( 1981b) 275\u00ad81;  cf.  also  Spadea  ( 1987)). The  harbour  was  located  on  the  estuary  of  the  ancient Apsias,  outside  the  urban  area  (Vallet  ( 1958)  130\u00ad31; Martorano  ( 1985)  234\u00ad36).  Spadea  suggests  a  harbour  loca- tion  on  the  estuary  of  the  Fumara  dell'Annunciata,  below the  city  and  near  the  recent  urban  investigations  at  the  Lido (Spadea  ( 1986)  461\u00ad62). The  urban  layout  is  largely  unknown,  apart  from  the remains  of  a  few  public  buildings,  the  location  of  sanctuar- ies,  and  the  circuit  wall.  The  course  of  the  early  fortification remains  uncertain,  though  part  of  a  C 6\u00adC5(?)  dried  brick wall  is  preserved  (Guzzo  ( 1982b)  fig.  at  p. 129).  Significant stretches  of  a  C 4  double  curtain-wall  are  preserved  along  the coast  and  inland  along  the  Aspromonte  hills  (refs.:  Guzzo ( 1982b)  fig.  at  p. 130;  Tr\u00e9ziny  ( 1986)  192  n. 64).  It  is  uncertain whether  the  wall  is  earlier  or  later  than  the  alleged  destruc- tion  of  the  city  by  Dionysios  I  in  387  (cf.  Diod. 14.111\u00ad12);  for- tifications are attested b y  Diodorus  before  ( 14.90.5  (r 393)) and  after  ( 16.45.9  (r 350))  the  destruction.  The  area  within the  C 4  circuit  wall  comprised  about  70  ha,  obviously  less during  the  Archaic  period  if  part  of  the  Aspropomonte  hills were  outside  the  fortified area. Evidence  of  public  architecture  is  mostly  late.  In  connec- tion  with  the  ekklesia  held  by the  Rhegians  in  344,  on  the occasion  of  Timoleon's  visit,  a  bema  is  mentioned  (Diod. 16.68.4\u00ad5;Plut.  Tim. 10.1\u00ad4;  Costabile  ( 1978)  45\u00ad49).  Part of a  C 4  koilon  situated  on  the  upper  slopes  of  the  city  belong  to a  theatre  or  an  ekklesiasterion;  the  diameter  of  the  structure, c. 50  m,  gives  a  seating  capacity  of  about  1,500\u00ad1,600. Martorano  ( 1985)  interprets  the  structure  as  an  ekklesiasteri- on  on  the  basis  of  size  and  features  perhaps  not  compatible with  a  theatre proper,  and  P.  Orsi  ( 1922)  has  interpreted  the remains  as  an  odeion,  but  these  interpretations  are  uncertain (Todisco  ( 1990)  137\u00ad41;  Hansen  and  Fischer-Hansen  ( 1994) 72\u00ad74). Little  is  known  of  Rhegion's  major  sanctuaries.  The importance  of  Apollo  at  Rhegion  is  reflected in the founda- tion  myth  of  the  city  (Lacroix  ( 1965);  Costabile  ( 1979))  and in  the  name  \"Phoibia\"  given  to  a  quarter  in  the  city  (supra). The  oldest  explicit  evidence  of  a  temple  of  Apollo,  however, is  a  C 1l  honorary  decree  (ILS 5471).  The  location  is unknown,  but  it  was  possibly  in  the  lower  part  of  the  city (Vallet  ( 1958)  123\u00ad24,  250\u00ad51;  cf.  Sabbione  ( 1981b)  278).  A sanctuary,  possibly  for  the  chthonic  divinities,  was  located close  to  the  theatre  and  proves  the  public  character  of  the whole  area  (Vallet  ( 1958)  121\u00ad23).A  C 5  graffito r efers  to Zeus Keraunos  (Mosino  ( 1995)).  According  to  Thuc. 6.44.3, Artemis  had  a  sanctuary  outside  the  city  by  the  coast  (see further  Vallet  ( 1958)  79,  130\u00ad31).  There  are  remains  of  yet another  suburban  temple,  \"de  la  Marina\"  (Vallet  ( 1958)  124 pl.  II. 3  (number  left  out  but  temple  indicated  to  the  south- west  of  Hellenistic  cemetery  no. 10)).  So  far  no  Archaic tombs  have  been  located,  all  tomb  evidence  being  C 4- Hellenistic  (Spadea  ( 1986)). Communal  oracle  consultation  is  reported  by  Aristox.  fr. 117,Wehrli.Anaxilas  was  victorious  in  the  mule  race  in  480  at Olympia  (Olympionikai 208)  and  the  cithara-player  Ariston participated  in  the  Pythian  Games  (Timaeus  (FGrHist 566) fr. 43).  Rhegion  possibly  made  a  communal  dedication  at Delphi  shortly  after  the  abolition  of  tyranny  in  461  (IGDGG no. 37;  cf.  also  38:a kerykeion  possibly  also  connected  with the  abolition  of  tyranny).  At  Olympia  dedications  of weapons  commemorate  C 6\u00adC5  victories  over  Lokroi  (no. 59)  and  Gela  (no. 17)  (Yalouris  ( 1980)  15;  OlBer  viii. 102  pl. 48.1;  pls. 36,  38;  SEG 24  304\u00ad5;  IGDGG  nos. 33\u00ad34). Rhegion  commenced  its  coinage  c. 510  with  a  small  issue  of drachms  on  the  Euboic  standard  and  in  the  incuse  technique;  the  type  depicts  a  man-faced  bull  (probably  the river-god  of  the  river  Apsias),  above  a  locust;  the  obv. legend (retr.)  is  in  the  Chalkidian  script  (C.  Boehringer  ( 1984\u00ad85)  111\u00ad12;Rutter,HN\u00b3  2468).The  next issue,  struck  c. 494  at  the  beginning  of  the  reign  of  Anaxilas, consists  of  staters  and  drachms  on  the  Euboic  standard,  in double  relief,  similar  to  Messanian  issues  and  like  them inspired  by  Samian  types:  obv.  lion  mask  facing;  rev.  calf  's head  and  legend  (retr.)  (Caccamo  Caltabiano ( 1993)  17\u00ad18,  25\u00ad26;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  2469;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1923). Lower  denominations  have the  same  obv.type,  rev. in dotted  circle  (Caccamo  Caltabiano  ( 1993)  26\u00ad27).  A  small issue  of  tetradrachms  on  the  Attic  standard,  with  types  as above,  were  struck  c. 485\u00ad480  (Caccamo  Caltabiano  ( 1993) 28).  C. 480,  still  during  the  reign  of  Anaxilas,  Rhegion  and Messana  simultaneously  struck  tetradrachms  and  fractions on  the  Attic  standard:  obv.  mule  biga;  rev.  running  hare  and, on  Rhegian  coins,  the  legend  (retr.);  lower denominations  have obv.  running  hare,  rev.  legend in dotted  circle  (Caccamo  Caltabiano  ( 1993)  53\u00ad56;Rutter,HN\u00b3 2472ff;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1924\u00ad27).  The  abolition  of  tyrannical rule  at  Rhegion  in  461  led  to  a  new  coinage  from  c.C 5m: tetradrachms  and  drachms  with  obv.  lion  mask  as  above;  rev. 292 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo seated  male  figure surrounded b y  a  wreath,  probably  the oecist  Iokastos,  legendary  founder  of  the  city;  legend: ,  on  later  issues  (Lacroix  ( 1965) 44\u00ad45;  Stazio  ( 1978)  195\u00ad96;Rutter,  HN \u00b32477ff,  2488ff;  SNG Cop.  Italy 1928\u00ad30,  1932  (obol)).  The  revival  of  coinage  at Rhegion  has  been  connected  with  the  appearance  of  over- struck  Athenian  tetradrachms  in  this  city  and  at  Messana, reflecting A thenian  influence in South I taly  and  the  founda- tion  of  Thourioi  in  444  (Kraay  ( 1976)  219).  The  rev.  type  was changed  c. 420  to  a  head  of  Apollo,  legends  , ,  (Rutter,  HN \u00b32494;  SNG  Cop. Italy 1933\u00ad34).A  later  issue  with  obv.  head  of  Apollo;  rev.  lion mask  (Rutter,  HN \u00b32501;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1945\u00ad52)  is  attrib- uted  to 356\u00ad351  and  the  refoundation  of  Rhegion  by Dionysios  II,  see  supra  (Kraay  ( 1976)  22).  Bronze  coinage, with  types  similar  to  the  silver,  was  introduced  in  C 5s (Caccamo  Caltabiano  ( 1979);  Rutter,  HN \u00b32513ff;  SNG  Cop. Italy 1939\u00ad40). Rhegion  was  the  metropolis  of  Pyxous,  founded  in 476\u00ad465  by  Mikythos  (Diod. 11.59;Strabo 6.1.1;  see  further the  entry  for  Pyxous). 69.

Lokroi  is  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  at  Pind.  Ol. 10.13,  98;  Pl.  Tim. 20A,  Leg. 638B;  Dem. 24.139,  and  I.Locri 1.1, italia  and  kampania  273 etc.  (C 4m\u00adC3m);  and  in  the  urban  sense  at  Thuc. 7.35.2  and Ps.-Skylax 13,  where  Lokroi  is  the  first t oponym  listed  after the  heading    .A    was included  in  the  Aristotelian  collection  of 158  politeia  (frr. 547\u00ad48,  Rose;  Heracl.  Lemb. 60); is  found  in Arist.  Pol. 1273b31,  1274a22.  Patris  is  found  in  SEG 29  951  (C 4; CEG ii  835). The  internal  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on C 4s  coins  (infra)  and  in  I.Locri 9.5  (C 4m\u00adC3m);  the  external collective use  is  found  in  SEG 11  1211  ( 525\u00ad500),cf.Lombardo ( 1989)  429;  SEG 24  304\u00ad5  (C 6\u00adC5),  311\u00ad12  (c. 480s);  Thuc. 3.115.6,4.1.2;Arist.Pol.1274a22,1307a38.The  external  individ- ual  use  is  found  in  IvO 144.1,  3  (c. 472);  IG ii\u00b2  3052  ( 328/7)  and Timaios  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 43. Lokroi  was  founded  by Lokrians,  but  already  in  antiquity it  was  debated  whether  the  founders  had  been  West  or  East Lokrians  (Ephor.  fr. 138  apud  Strabo  6.1.7;  Ps.-Skymnos 312\u00ad16).  The  colonists  first settled at Cape Z ephyrion  (mod- ern  Capo  Bruzzano),  but  a  few  years  later  they  moved  to a permanent  site  at  the  \"hill  of  Epopis\"  with  the  co-operation of  Syracusans  and  possibly  of  others  (Strabo  6.1.7);  the  pas- sage  in  Strabo  is  corrupt,  and  it  is  uncertain  whether  he named  others  as  participating  in  the  relocation;  however, Tarentines  may  have  participated,  and  Pausanias'  statement ( 3.3.1)  that  Lokroi  was  a  Lakedaimonian  foundation  may  be a  reflection of  (alleged)  Tarantine  participation  (cf. Sourvinou-Inwood  ( 1974)  189;  Van  Compernolle  ( 1992) 762\u00ad63;  see  further  B\u00e9rard  ( 1957)  199\u00ad209  and  Niutta  ( 1977) 260\u00ad61).  According  to  Strabo  6.1.7,  the  foundation  took place  a  little  after  the  foundation  of  Kroton  ( 710)  and Syracuse  ( 733),  and  according  to  Polyb. 12.6b.9  at  the  time  of the  First  Messenian  War  (c. 735\u00ad717);  according  to  Eusebios at  the  time  of  Olympiad  25.1  or 26.4  ( 679/8  or 673/2).A  foun- dation  in  the  first decades of  C 7  is  now  confirmed b y  archae- ological  evidence  (survey:  Sabbione  ( 1982)  277\u00ad93).  Perhaps as  early  as  C 6m  a  foundation  legend  modelled  upon  that  of Taras  was  in  existence;  it  is  discussed  by  Sourvinou-Inwood ( 1974). The  name  of  the  territory  was  (Thuc. 3.99, 103.3).  The  southern  border  between  the  territories  of Lokroi  and  Rhegion  (no. 68)  was  marked  by  the  river  Halex (modern  Galati)  (Strabo  6.1.9;  according  to Paus. 6.6.4  by the  river  Kaikinos;  cf.  Costabile  ( 1992)  166\u00ad68).  The  river Sagra,  theatre  of  the  C 6  battle  between  Lokroi  and  Kroton (no. 56)  (Strabo  6.1.10),  separated  Lokrian  from  Kaulonian territory;  the  Sagra  is  identified w ith  the  modern  river Allaro  near  Kaulonia  (no. 55)  or  with  the  modern  river Torbido  near  Gioiosa  Ionica  (Osanna  ( 1992)  214,  222  n. 47). The  chora  of  Lokroi  comprised  at  first only the c. 110  km \u00b2 coastal  plain  within  the  line  of  foothills  of  the  Sila  moun- tains,  although  for  the  moment  there  is  a  lack  of  agrarian structures  from  the  Archaic  period  that  might  be  associated with  Lokroi  (Sabbione  ( 1982)  293\u00ad97;  Osanna  ( 1992)  205\u00ad7). Lokrian  territory  soon  extended  to  the  borders  of  Rhegion and  Kaulonia,  and  by  C 7l\u00adC6e  Lokrian  dominion  extended to  the  Ionian  Sea,  where  Medma  (no. 60),  Metauros  (no. 62) and  Hipponion  (no. 53)  were  founded  (Musti  ( 1976)  108\u00ad20; Cordiano  ( 1995b)  88\u00ad91;  and  the  respective entries).  In 389 Dionysios  I  of  Syracuse  handed  over  to Lokroi  the  territory of  Kaulonia,  whose  inhabitants  had  been  relocated  to Syracuse  (no. 47;Diod.  14.106.3);  in  388  the  inhabitants  of Hipponion  were  relocated  to  Syracuse,  and  its  territory handed  over  to  Lokroi  (Diod. 14.107.2);  Skylletion  was  also handed  over  to Lokroi  (Strabo  6.1.10),  and  Medma  may  also have  been  given  to  Lokroi  (RE  xiii. 2.  1333).  Hipponion  was lost  again  in  379  (Diod. 15.24);  and  Kaulonia  seems  to  have been  refounded  c. 357  by  Dionysios  II  of  Syracuse,  as  may  be inferred  from  Diod. 16.10.2  and 11.3  (cf.  Plut.  Dio 26.7).  A C 4m  war  with  the  Leukanians  is  reported  in  Just.  Epit. 31.3.3. A  kome  in  Lokrian  territory is  very likely  referred  to in FGrHist 577,fr.  2.10  (r 427/6).  A  peripolion,  i.e.  military fortress  in  the  territory,  is  mentioned  in  Thuc. 3.99. A  C 6  alliance  with  Siris  (no. 69)  is  reported  by Just.  Epit. 20.2.10,  and  a  C 6  alliance  with  Rhegion  (no. 68)  by Strabo 6.1.10.An  alliance  with  Syracuse  is  attested  by  Thuc. 3.86.2.A treaty  was  concluded  with  Athens  (no. 361)  in  422  (Thuc. 5.5.2\u00ad3);  a  treaty  with  Sparta  (no. 345)  in  411  is  indicated  by Thuc. 8.91.1,  which  attests  to  Lokrian  naval  forces  serving with  the  Peloponnesians.  After  the  congress  of  Gela  in  424, Lokroi  sent  epoikoi  to  Sicilian  Messana  (no. 51),  which  was experiencing  a  stasis  at  that  point,  one  faction  inviting  the Lokrians;  the  epoikoi  were,  however,  soon  expelled,  but  dur- ing  their  residence  Messana  was  dependent  on  Lokroi (Thuc. 5.5.1).  In  396,  1,000  Lokrians  were  relocated  by Dionysios  I  of  Syracuse  to  Sicilian  Messana  (Diod. 14.78.5). The  existence  of  a  Lokrian  navy  is  attested  by  Thuc. 4.1.2 (ten  ships), 8.91.1,  and  Diod. 12.54.4  (r 427)  (five ships).  A contingent  of 300  soldiers  is  mentioned  at  Thuc. 3.103.3.Late sources  report  15,000  (Just.  Epit. 20.3.4)  or  10,000  (Strabo 6.1.10)  Lokrian  troops  as  having  fought  in  the  C 6  battle  at the  Sagra.  Polemarchoi  are  attested  in  the  Lokroi  Tables (I.Locri 21.5  (C 4m\u00adC3m)). Sending  of  envoys  is  attested  in  Diod. 8.32.1  (rC 6); reception  of  envoys  is  attested  in  Diod. 14.44.6  (r 398). F.Delphes iii.1176  (prior  to 280)  is  a  grant  of  proxeny  etc.  by Delphi  (no. 177)  to  a  man  described  as     274 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo '[] `  (on  which  see  further Hipponion  (no. 53)).  A  citizen  of  Lokroi  served  as Epidaurian  theorodokos  in 356/5  (IG iv\u00b2.195.41). A  system  of  three  phylai,  each  subdivided  into  ten  or eleven  demes,  is  attested  by  the  C 4m\u00adC3m  Lokrian  Tables (Jones,  POAG 168\u00ad69).  This  system  was  used  to  fill boards of officials c omprising  three  members  (Jones,  POAG 169);  the eponymous  magistracy  rotated  among  the  phylai  (Jones, POAG 170).  The  existence  of  phatrai  is  implied  by  the  exist- ence  of  a  magistrate  styled  (De  Franciscis  ( 1972) tab. 22;  Costabile  ( 1992)  212). The  constitution  of  Lokroi  prior  to the  tyranny  of Dionysios  II  (infra)  is  described  as  an  aristocracy  in  Arist. Pol. 1307a34ff.According  to  Polyb. 12.5.6\u00ad7,  nobility  was  con- ditional  upon  being  a  descendant  of  the  women  who  had belonged  to  the  \" 100  houses\"  of  the  founding  Lokrians.  In addition  to  some  unspecified archontes,Polyb. 12.16.6  men- tions  the  office of \u00b5,  who  seems  to  have  been  the chief  magistrate  at  the  time  referred  to  (Walbank,  HCP  ad loc.);  at  Polyb. 12.16.10  is  a  reference  to the  \" 1,000\",  presum- ably  the  council  (Walbank,  HCP  ad  loc.)  or  the  assembly; since  was  the  name  of  the  council  in  C 4s  (infra)  and \u00b5  that  of  the  assembly  in  democratic  Lokroi  (infra), Polybios'  information  presumably  refers  to the  aristocratic constitution.  A  gerousia  seems  to  be  indicated  by  Porph.  Vita Pythagorae 56  (rC 6l),  but  see  RE  xiii. 2.  1347.  A  differentiated system  of  officials for this period is indicated b y  Pl.  Tim. 20A.  Nomophylakes  are  attested  in  Stob. 4.2.19.In 356,  when Dionysios  II  was  expelled  from  Syracuse,  he  found  refuge  in Lokroi  (Just.  Epit. 21.2.9);  in  352  he  became  tyrant  and  ruled Lokroi  for  six  years  (Just.  Epit. 21.3.9;  RE  xiii. 2.  1335).  In  346, the  Locrians  expelled  Dionysios,  and  a  severe  stasis  broke out,  which  led  to  the  establishment  of  a  more  democratic constitution  (Arist.  Pol. 1307a38;Strabo 6.1.8;  Berger  ( 1992) 27),  which  is  reflected in the Lokrian T ables  (infra),  e.g.  in the  formula       \u00b5  (I.Locri 4.7, etc.  (C 4m\u00adC3m)). Ephor.  fr. 138  (cf.  Strabo  6.1.8)  states  that  tradition  held the  Lokrians  to  have  been  the  earliest  community  to  employ written  laws.  The  reference  is  to the  code  of  Zaleukos,  who was  nomothetes  at  Lokroi  according  to  Arist.  Pol. 1274a22  (cf. Iambl.  VP 130,  172)  and  whose  activity  is  dated  to  not  long after  the  foundation  of  the  city  (Gagarin  ( 1986)  129\u00ad30  n. 27).Civic  turmoil  is  reported  to  have  preceded  the  legal  code of  Zaleukos  (Arist.  fr. 555;  Gagarin  ( 1986)  58\u00ad59).  A  law,  pre- sumably  of  C 4  (cf. \u00b5   ),  regulated  the  conditions under  which  landed  property  could  be  alienated  (Arist.  Pol. 1266b19\u00ad21). After  the  constitutional  reforms  of  the  340s,  the  epony- mous  official was an archon  (see  SEG 30  1172;  I.Locri 1.1,etc. (C 4m\u00adC3m)).  A  is  mentioned  in  I.Locri 1.2,etc. (C 4m\u00adC3m).  The  following  boards  of  officials are attested (all  C 4m\u00adC3m): (I.Locri 21.2),  (I.Locri 3.13), \u00b5\u00b5  (I.Locri 2.1),  (I.Locri 32.7), (I.Locri 2.3), (I.Locri 2.5) and (I.Locri 3.8).  A  is  mentioned  in I.Locri 8.6  and  a  in  I.Locri 21.6  (both  C 4m\u00adC3m). Whether  the  mentioned  in  I.Locri 1.2,etc. (C 4m\u00adC3m)  was  a  civic  magistracy  is  unresolved  (SEG 45 1443).Decrees  of  the  assembly  are  referred  to in  I.Locri 2.7,9, 10,etc.(C4m\u00adC3m).  A  probouleutic  procedure  is  indicated by  the  formula  \u00b5   \u00b5  (I.Locri 2.7,9,10, etc.  (C 4m\u00adC3m))  or       \u00b5 (I.Locri 4.7,etc.(C4m\u00adC3m)). The  literary  tradition  mentions  a  first settlement of Lokrians  at  Cape  Zephyrion,  but  as  yet  there  is  no  archaeo- logical  evidence  for  such  a  settlement  (Van  Compernolle ( 1992)).  After  a  few  years  the  colonists  relocated  to  the  his- torical  site  of  Lokroi,  with  evidence  of  Greek  settlers  from c. 700,  which  fits Strabo's c hronology  ( 6.1.7)  but  is  earlier than  the  Eusebian  foundation  date  (Van  Compernolle ( 1992)).  According  to  Foti  ( 1976)  358  there  is  evidence  of indigenous  \"cohabitation\"  with  the  Greek  settlers,  reflecting the  tradition  of  a  period  of  peaceful  co-existence  found  in Polyb. 12.5.10  (Sabbione  ( 1982)  277\u00ad98).  Lokroi  was  not, therefore,  founded  on  virgin  soil,  but  on  the  site  of  an indigenous  community  (RE  xiii. 2.  1310);  C 8l  contacts between  the  indigenous  population  and  Greeks  are  attested by  ceramic  evidence  (Sabbione  ( 1982)  279).  The  city  was founded  on  the  slopes  of  a  mountain  ridge,  the  hill  of  Epopis according  to Strabo  6.1.7,  with  three  peaks  Mannella, Abbadessa  and  Castellace  (Foti  ( 1976)  pl. 27;  survey  of  site: Costamagna  and  Sabbione  ( 1990)),  incorporating  the coastal  plain  between  the  Portigliola  and  Ficareto  river  valleys.  It  must  have  had  harbour  facilities,  now  possibly identified on the Ficareto estuary ( infra). The 7  km  circuit  wall  (overall  plan  in  Costabile  ( 1992)  36, pl. 13)  encircled  a  vast  area  of  c. 240  ha,  of  which  the  area south  of  the  \"Dromos\"  comprises  c. 80  ha.  The  upper  part  of the  city,  though  enclosed  by  the  circuit  wall,  is  morphologi- cally  irregular  and  not  readily  accessible  for  habitation.  The extant  wall  is  mainly  Hellenistic,  but  stretches  of  it  use  earli- er,  C 6  elements  in  their  structure,  particularly  in  the  areas  of Centocamere  and  of  the  Maras\u00e0  sanctuary  (Barra  Bagnasco ( 2000)  11\u00ad12,  30);  lengths  of  isodomic  structure  are  dated  to C 5m\u00adC4m,  whereas  the  curtain-wall  in  ashlar  strengthened italia  and  kampania  275 with  towers  is  dated  to  C 4m\u00adC3e  (Foti  ( 1976)  346\u00ad49;  cf.  De Franciscis  ( 1972)  163\u00ad69  on  pyrgopoiia  in  the  Lokrian Tables).  A  siege  is  reported  for  C 4m  by  Strabo  6.1.8.  The  vast area  encircled  by  the  circuit  wall  was  never  fully  urbanised. The  main  zones  of  habitation  comprised  the  two  main urban  complexes  on  the  lower  plain  inside  the  city  wall  and the  habitation  area  \"Caruso\"  in  the  upper  part  of  the  city, where  the  theatre  was  also  located--possibly in the v icinity of  an  (unidentified) agora ( infra).  The  \"Dromos\",  a  road  of ancient  origin  apparently  preserving  the  ancient  name, divided  the  city  into  an  upper  and  a  lower  part.  Extensive habitation  areas  have  been  excavated  south  of  the \"Dromos\":  to  the  west,  the  so-called  Centocamere  with  sev- eral  insulae  and  a  regular,  orthogonal  layout,  and  to  the  east, the  insulae  near  the  Maras\u00e0  sanctuary.  The  evidence  points to  a  C 5e  origin,  and  to two  later,  C 3  phases  (for  the  extensive excavations  of  the  lower  city,  see  Barra  Bagnasca  ( 1977), ( 1989a,b,c)).Habitation  extended  up  the  slopes  north  of  the \"Dromos\"  (Osanna  ( 1992)  218,fig.  16).  The  orientation  of the  insulae  (lengthwise  following  the  slope,  the  short  side facing  the  sea)  facilitated  drainage. To  the  south  and  nearer  the  coast--separated from the habitation  area  of  Centocamere  by a  14  m-wide  plateia-- insulae  of  irregular  shape  and  various  systems  of  drainage, basins  and  kilns  have  revealed  an  industrial  and  artisan quarter,  primarily  of  C 4  (Barra  Bagnasco  ( 1976)  380\u00ad82,  pl. 35:H1\u00adH3,  403\u00ad4).  This  area  between  the  city  wall  and  the plateia  of  the  city  to  the  north  seems  not  to  have  been  occu- pied  in  the  Archaic  period,  apart  from  single  stoas  and  the monumental  gate;  a  mercantile  agora  related  to  the  sea  and harbour  was  situated  here  in  this  period  (Osanna  ( 1992) 215). The  chronological  framework  of  the  development  of urbanisation  is  not  very clear,  but  there  is  testimony  of  a C 6m  orthogonal  urban  organisation  of  the  area  between  the theatre  and  the  sea,  and  of  the  monumentalisation  of  the sanctuaries  of  Sto\u00e0  ad  U  (infra),  Maras\u00e0  Sud,  Maras\u00e0  and Marafioti,  a  culminating  point  of  urban  development-- reflected also in the t erritorial  expansion  in  this  period (Barra  Bagnasco  ( 1996a);  Parra  ( 1998)  314). The  C 6  circuit  wall  separated  the  habitation  area  from  the coast,  but  gates--with monumental drainage c onduits-- sanctuaries  and  harbour  facilities  (cf.  Thuc. 6.44.2;  7.25.2) outside  the  city  wall  were  all  part  of  an  early,  integrated urban  layout  (Barra  Bagnasco  ( 2000)). The  richly  decorated  house  and  a  votive  deposit  located outside  the  sanctuary  of  Aphrodite  of  Maras\u00e0  Sud  has  been interpreted  as  a  hestiaterion  or  a  prytaneion  (Barra  Bagnasco ( 1996a)  57;  cf.  however,  Barra  Bagnasco  ( 1996b)  28\u00ad29  ident- ifying  it  as  a  sanctuary  of  Adonis-Aphrodite).  The  theatre, situated  in  the  upper  part  of  the  city,  was  built  originally  in C 4m,  but  since  it  was  rebuilt  in  later  periods,  its  seating capacity  of  c. 4,500  can  only  tentatively  be  assumed  for  the original  phase  (Parra ( 1977\u00ad78),  ( 1998)).  It  may  have  served democratic  assemblies  as  well  (Costabile  ( 1992)  322  n. 11). Several  sanctuaries  were  scattered  across  the  upper  parts of  the  city  and  in  the  lowland  areas,  primarily  in  the  vicinity of  the  circuit  wall  (surveys:  Torelli  ( 1976);  Zuntz  ( 1971) 158\u00ad73).The  \"Casa  Marafioti\"  Doric  temple  of 540\u00ad530,with remains  limited  to  parts  of  the  foundation  and  foundation trenches  (Orsi  ( 1911a)  27\u00ad41,  49\u00ad62),  was  situated  inside  the circuit  wall  on  a  spur  near  the  theatre  and  agora(?),  and  was part  of  a  larger  temenos  overlooking  the  lower  city  (for  an agora(?),  theatre and  temenos:  Parra  ( 1998)  311\u00ad12);  the  ded- icatee  of  the  sanctuary  has  been  identified as Z eus  Olympios (which  is  not  accepted  unanimously)  on  the  basis  of  the Olympieion  archive  found  in  the  vicinity  (De  Franciscis ( 1972);  SEG 29  950;  Costabile  ( 1992)).  Votive  deposits  found near  the  theatre  attest  to  cults  of  Athena,  Artemis, Persephone,  Dionysos  and  a  local  hero  (Parra  ( 1998)  315\u00ad17). The  sanctuary  of  Persephone,  and  of  Demeter  and Aphrodite(?),  at  Mannella,  probably  \"the  most  famous Persephone  sanctuary  in  Italy\"  mentioned  by  Diodorus ( 23.4.3  (r 205)),  is  located  north  of  the  city,  outside  the  city wall  in  the  Mannella  valley  (see  Torelli  ( 1976)  158  n. 16  with refs.;  Hinz  ( 1998)  203\u00ad6).  The  sanctuary  is  above  all  known from  the  votive  pinakes  with  the  cultic  representations  of  the rape of  Persephone,  Hieros  Gamos,  sacrificial scenes,  etc. (Pr\u00fcckner  ( 1968);  Sabbione  ( 1996)).  An  Athena  sanctuary with  a  simple  naiskos  of  uncertain  date  lies  inside  the  circuit wall  at  the  top  of  the  Mannella  hill,  which  may  have  formed the  acropolis  of  the  city  (Orsi  ( 1909)  323;(1911a)  62).  The location  could  indicate  a  sanctuary  of  Athena  Polias,  but  the votive  terracottas  show  Athena  primarily  as  a  Promachos. The  monumental  C 5  Ionic  temple,  placed  within  a  larger temenos  in  the  Maras\u00e0  area  in  the  lower  city,  can  be  traced back  to C 7  (De  Franciscis  ( 1979);  Gullini  ( 1976)  411\u00ad36).  It has  without  strong  evidence  been  attributed  to  Aphrodite (Pr\u00fcckner  ( 1968)  12),  but  the  possible  origin  of  the  Ludovisi throne  in  the  sanctuary  may  support  this  identification.  In the  area  of  the  Centocamere,  south  of  the  circuit  wall,  a series  of  oikoi  were  laid  out  so  as  to  form  a  U-shaped  struc- ture  (conventionally  called  Sto\u00e0  ad  U);  they  formed  a  single sacred  structure,  built  in  C 7e  with  two  short  wings  which were  prolonged  and  enlarged  in  C 6m,  on  either  side  of  a central  space.  In  the  open  space  inside  the  wings  of  the  stoa 276 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo 371  bothroi  with  remains  of  sacred  meals  and  some  votive material  indicate  cult  activity;  C 4  graffiti suggest that the sanctuary  was  dedicated  to  Aphrodite  (Torelli  ( 1976)  147\u00ad56; cf.  Musti  ( 1976)  65\u00ad70).  A  bronze  phiale  from  the Olympieion  sanctuary  with  a  dedication  to  Aphrodite  may refer  to  this  or  to  the  Maras\u00e0  sanctuary  (Costabile  ( 1992) 97\u00ad101,  113).  Twenty  single  square  rooms  laid  out  along  the south  side  of  the  circuit  wall,  with  yet  another  complex  fur- ther  to the  south,  are  probably  part  of  this  extensive C 4  sanc- tuary  complex  (Barra  Bagnasco  ( 1976)  379\u00ad80,  pl. 35, \"S 1\u00adS2\").  An  extra-mural  sanctuary  with  remains  of  a C 6l\u00adC5  cult  building  north-east  of  the  Sto\u00e0  ad  U  and  south of  the  circuit  wall  (Barra  Bagnasco  ( 1990b),(1996b)  28\u00ad30)  is attributed  to  Aphrodite  on  the  basis  of  dedicatory  graffiti and  a  C 5f  votive  inscription  (Barra  Bagnasco  and  Pugliese Carratelli  ( 1990)),  and  the  cult  is  therefore  to  be  seen  in  con- junction  with  the  Sto\u00e0  ad  U  and  the  Maras\u00e0  sanctuary. Votive  deposits  discovered  outside  the  city  by  the  main  route to  the  eastern  cemetery  attest  a  C 5\u00adC4  cult  of  Zeus  (Barra Bagnasco  ( 1996c))  and  a  sanctuary  of  Demeter,  probably  a Thesmophorion,  delimited  by a  temenos  wall  outside  the south-eastern  corner  of  the  city  wall  was  in  use  from  C 6s (Grattarola  ( 1994);  Milanesio  ( 1996);  Hinz  ( 1998)  206\u00ad8). The  cemeteries  are  located  mainly  in  the  middle  and lower  plain  encircling  the  city  at  the  localities  of  Vallone  di Canale,  Contrada  Lucifero  (with  1,676  tombs,  primarily  C 6: Orsi  ( 1909)  319,(1913)),  Monaci  (with  Greek  material  from C 8l\u00adC7e);  Parapezza  and  Tribona  (Foti  ( 1976)  359\u00ad61; Osanna  ( 1992)). The  patron  divinity  was  presumably  Athena,  who appeared  to  Zaleukos  in  a  dream  to  give  him  his  laws  (Arist. fr. 555).  A  local  calendar  is  attested  by  the  Lokrian  Tables, which  name  twelve  months  and  attest  to  an  intercalary month  (see  Niutta  ( 1977)  266). Communal  oracle  consultation  is  reported  by  Arist.  fr. 555 and  Aristox.  fr. 117,  Wehrli.  Several  citizens  of  Lokroi  won Olympic  victories:  Euthykles  in  488  (Olympionikai 180 (pentathlon)),  Euthymos  in  484,  476  and 472  (Olympionikai 191,  214,  227  (boxing)),  Hagesidamos  in  476  (Olympionikai 218  (boys'  boxing))  and  Keton  in  448  (Olympionikai 297 (pentathlon)).  Eunomos  won  a  Pythian  victory  in  a  musical contest  (Timaeus  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 43).A  communal  dedica- tion  of 525\u00ad500  (cf.  Lombardo  ( 1989)  429)  with  Hipponion (no. 53)  and  Medma  (no. 60)  at  Olympia  commemorates  a victory  over  Kroton  (no. 56)  (SEG 11  1211).  Paus. 6.19.6 mentions  an  Archaic  communal  dedication  of  a  boxwood image  of  Apollo,  possibly  in  commemoration  of  the  battle  of the  Sagra  (LSAG 286).De  La  Geni\u00e8re  suggests  that  the  archi- tectural  remains  of  the  so-called  \"Monoptoros  of  the Sikyonians\"  at  Delphi  are  the  remains  of  a  Lokrian  treasury (de  La  Geni\u00e8re  ( 1986);  Griffin ( 1982)  108  too  is  very  doubtful about  the  traditional  attribution  of  this  building  to  Sikyon). The  evidence,  mainly  iconographic,  for  a  Western  Greek origin  of  this  treasury  is  strong,  though  the  Lokrian  candi- dature  must  remain  hypothetical. Lokroi  did  not  strike  its  own  coins  until  C 4;  the  start  of minting  is  dated  with  some  uncertainty  to  375\u00ad350  (survey of  Lokrian  mint:  Pozzi  Paolini  ( 1976)).  Staters  and  drachms with  Corinthian  types  and  on  the  Corinthian  standard  were issued  from  before  C 4m  to  C 3e,  revealing  strong  ties  with eastern  Sicily:  obv.  Pegasos;  rev.  head  of  Athena  in Corinthian  helmet,  legends: ,  ,  ,   (Pozzi  Paolini  ( 1976)  221\u00ad33;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  2336ff;  SNG  Cop. Italy 1868\u00ad70).  A  contemporary  issue  of  staters  on  an  Italic standard  has  obv.  head  of  Zeus,  legend: ;  rev.  seated Eirene,  legend: (Pozzi  Paolini  ( 1976)  242\u00ad47; Rutter,  HN \u00b3  2310);  this  was  followed  c.C 4m  by an  issue  of staters  with  obv.  head  of  Zeus  with  unkempt  hair  and  beard, legend: ;  rev.  eagle  devouring  hare,  both  types with  many  variants  (Pozzi  Paolini  ( 1976)  247\u00ad52;Rutter, HN \u00b3  2311ff;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1858\u00ad59,  1861\u00ad62).  Later  issues have  obv.  eagle  devouring  hare;  rev.  thunderbolt  with  differ- ent  symbols  and  legend: (Pozzi  Paolini  ( 1976) 255\u00ad61;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  2318;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1865\u00ad66).  Lower denominations  are  triobols,  diobols  and  obols  (Pozzi Paolini  ( 1976)  267\u00ad73;Rutter,  HN \u00b32329ff;  SNG  Cop.

At the  time  of  Alexander the  Molossian  or  Pyrrhos,  Lokroi  also  issued  a  gold  coinage, denomination  one-tenth  of  a  gold  stater  on  the  Attic  stand- ard:  obv.  head  of  eagle,  legend: ;  rev.  winged  thunderbolt (Pozzi  Paolini  ( 1976)  279\u00ad84;Rutter,  HN \u00b32345;  SNG  Cop. Italy 1857). A  unique  tetradrachm  on  the  Euboic\u00adAttic  standard  has obv.  biga  of  mules  driven  by  a  charioteer  crowned  by  Nike, legend: ;  rev.  running  hare.  It  has  been  interpreted  as  a Messanian\u00adLokrian  alliance  coinage  of 425  (cf.  Thuc. 5.5.1), but  see  Pozzi  Paolini  ( 1976)  218\u00ad20  for  typological  and  tech- nical  anomalies. Bronze  coinage  commenced  c. 350;C4s  types  show  main- ly  Zeus  and  Athena,  C 3e  also  Persephone,  Apollo  and Herakles  (Pozzi  Paolini  ( 1976)  284\u00ad96;Rutter,  HN \u00b32353ff; SNG  Cop.  Italy 1871\u00ad98). Lokroi  was  the  metropolis  of  Hipponion  (no. 53)  and Medma  (no. 60)  (Thuc. 5.5.3;  cf.

Size of  territory: 2  (?).  Type:  [A].  The  toponym  is  (Hdt. 6.21.1;Strabo 6.1.1;  Ps.-Skylax 12  (emended,  infra)).  The  city- ethnic  is  or (C 6l  coins,  infra). In  Ps.-Skylax 12,  under  the  heading   ` ,  the  text  [ '    ] has been emend- ed  to read: ',    ;  if  the  emenda- tion  is  accepted,  Laos  is  here  classified as a polis  type  [A]  in the  urban  sense  as  well  as  an  apoikia.  After  the  defeat  of Sybaris  by  Kroton  in  510  but  before  494  (Hdt. 6.21.1),refugee Sybarites  settled  at  Laos  (a  Sybarite  colony:  Strabo  6.1.1  and infra),  being      \u00b5;  whether  this implies  polis  status  for  Laos  is  uncertain.  Polis  in  the  urban sense  is  found  in  Diod. 14.101.3  (r 390).  The  internal  collec- tive  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on  C 4l  bronze  coins (infra);  earlier  legends  employ  the  nominative  singular  of the  city-ethnic  (Guarducci,  EG  II: 618). Laos  was  a  colony  of  Sybaris  (no. 70.I)  (Strabo  6.1.1;see further  below  on  coinage)  and  refugee  Sybarites  settled there  (and  at  Skidros)  after  the  Krotoniate  defeat  of  Sybaris in 510  (Hdt. 6.21.1).  If  correctly  emended,  Ps.-Skylax  12 (supra)  describes  Laos  as  a  colony  of  Thourioi  (no. 74);  the 272 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo text  may  confuse  Thourioi  with  Sybaris,  or  it  may  refer  to  a C 5s  refoundation  of  Laos  by Thourioi  or  more  generally  to Thourian  influence at Laos.  The  date  of  foundation  is unknown;  the  terminus  ante  quem  for  the  existence  of  the Greek  community  is  c. 510,  when  it  commenced  minting (infra).  Prior  to 510,  Laos  may  have  been  an  Oinotrian  com- munity  dependent  upon  Sybaris  and  subsequently,  from C 6l  to  C 5f,  a  mixed  Oinotrian-Greek  settlement. The  size  of  the  territory of  C 6  Laos  amounted  to  c. 100 km \u00b2  when  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  deserted  indigenous settlements  and  of  Sybarite  influence in the t erritory  from Orsomarso  to Grisolia  (bordering  on  the  territory of Kerilloi)  and  including  some  of  the  territory on  the  right bank  of  the  river  Lao  (E.  Greco  ( 1995a)). Diod. 14.101.3  (r 390)  seems  to  describe  Laos  as  a Leukanian  settlement,  and  so  Laos  may  have  been  con- quered  by  the  Leukanians  in  C 5l.  The  city,  however,  seems not  to  have  lost  its  Greek  identity  completely,  and  the  C 4 Leukanian  town  was  mixed  Greek  and  non-Greek  (E.  Greco and  Schnapp  ( 1989)  45\u00ad46);  if  correctly  emended,  Ps.- Skylax 12  (supra)  lists  Laos  under  the  heading  poleis Hellenides,  and  the  city  issued  C 4s  bronze  coins  inscribed and  with  both  Greek  and  Leukanian  magis- trates'  names  (infra). The  site  of  the  Archaic  city  is  unknown,  but  it  is  here  taken for  granted  that  Archaic-C 5  Laos  was  located  in  the  vicinity (E.  Greco  and  Schnapp  ( 1989)  49\u00ad51)  of  C 4  Leukanian  Laos (infra).  According  to  Strabo  6.1.1,  Laos  was  a  river  and  a  polis a  short  distance  from  Hyele  on  the  Tyrrhenian  coast,  but  this reference  may  be  to the  C 4  site,  even  though  Strabo describes  it  as  a  colony  of  Sybaris  (cf.  E.  Greco  and  Schnapp ( 1989)  51;  Caruso  ( 1977)).  C 4  Laos  has  been  identified w ith the  settlement  on  the  hill  of  S.  Maria  del  Cedro,  c. 3  km  to  the south  of  the  estuary  of  the  river  Lao  (E.  Greco  ( 1995a); E.  Greco,  Luppino  and  Schnapp  ( 1989)).  The  desertion  of the  C 6  indigenous  settlements  in  the  hinterland  of  Laos  was probably  the  result  of  Sybarite  expansion,  and  the  \"heroon of  Drakon\"  (Strabo  6.1.1)  may  reflect G reek  control  over  the territory,  though  the  source  is  late  (E.  Greco  and  Schnapp ( 1989);  E.  Greco  ( 1995a)  71\u00ad73).  The  urban  site  excavated  on the  Marcellina  hill  has  not  (yet)  revealed  remains  earlier than  C 4s  (E.  Greco  and  Schnapp  ( 1989)  51),  and  so  the  histo- ry  of  the  Greek  city  is  known primarily  from  the  literary sources  and  from  the  numismatic  evidence.  Diod. 14.101.3 (r 390)  suggests  that  Laos  was  fortified. Laos  initiated  coinage  c. 510  with  issues  of  incuse  staters, drachms  and  triobols  on  the  Achaian  standard  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3 p. 176);  the  types  were  based  upon  the  Sybarite  bull  type  with some  variations:  obv.  man-headed  bull  looking  back  (river personification),  legend: ,  rev.  same  type  but  incuse, and  obv.  legend  completed  by  (retr.),  i.e.  (the  city-ethnic  (Guarducci,  EG  ii. 618)  and  not  the  locality Laino,  as  suggested  by  Zancani  Montuoro  ( 1949);  Sternberg ( 1973);  Gorini  ( 1975)  13;Rutter,HN  \u00b3  2270\u00ad72;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1145).  Double-relief  staters  and  triobols  dating  to  c. 475\u00ad450 have  obv.  man-headed  bull  looking  back  and  acorn  in  exer- gue,  legend: ;  rev.  similar  but  no  acorn  (Sternberg ( 1973);  Rutter,  HN \u00b3  2275\u00ad76;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1146\u00ad49);  an issue  of  triobols  and  smaller  issues  carries  acorn  as  rev.type (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  2278\u00ad81).  The  acorn  is  a  type  on  the  triobols  of Sybaris  (no. 70.III);  see  further  Rutter  ( 1997)  43  for  connec- tions  between  the  coinages  of  Sybaris  and  Laos.  An  issue  of drachms  and  triobols  is  dated  after  453:  obv.  man-faced  bull, legend ,  rev.  similar  (Rutter,  HN \u00b32286\u00ad88).  These types  cease  in  C 5m--that is,  c. 50  years  before  the  Leukanian  occupation.  A  punch  with  the  type  of  Sybaris  has  been found  at  Laos  (unpublished).  In  C 4l,  Laos,  now  a  mixed Leukanian\u00adGreek  community, issued  bronze  coins inscribed  ,  and  with  magistrates  names (Cantilena  ( 1989);  Rutter,  HN \u00b32289ff;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1150\u00ad51,  1155\u00ad57). A  series  of  C 6l  double-relief  staters  have  types:  obv. Krotoniate  tripod  and  legend  ;  rev.  bull  looking  back, legend (Gorini  ( 1975)  26;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  2273).  These  are attributed  by  Kraay  to  Sybaris  (no. 70.II),  the  Krotoniate  tri- pod  revealing  the  status  of  Sybaris  (no. 70.II)  as  within  the political  sphere  of  Kroton  though  partly  maintaining  its own  influence on Laos (Kraay ( 1958)  35;  Parise  ( 1982)  106\u00ad7; cf.  Cantilena  ( 1989)  32,who  sustains  the  attribution  to  Laos). An  issue  of  diobols  (Rutter,  HN \u00b32284\u00ad85)  may  be  an \"alliance  coinage\"  reflecting Laos'  participation  in  the refounding  of  Sybaris  (no. 70.III)  in  453. 59.

The  city-ethnic  is (Strabo  5.4.7  (rC 5?)). Pithekoussai  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Ps.- Skylax 10,  and  the  external  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is found  in  Strabo  5.4.7  (rC 5?).  However,  Pithekoussai  has often  been  denied  the  status  of  a  polis  and  described  as  an emporion,  i.e.  trading  station  (see  Hansen  4  ( 1997b)  99  n. 91; most  recent  discussion:  Boffa  ( 1998)).  Bartoloni  and Cordano  ( 1978)  denied  polis  status  to  Pithekoussai  because: (a)  the  site  is  not  described  as  an  apoikia  and  no  oecist  is named;  (b)  there  is  no  evidence  for  a  political  organisation of  the  community;  (c)  there  is  no  evidence  of  social  strat- ification;  (d)  though  predominantly  Greek,  the  population was  of  mixed  ethnicity.  While  some  of  these  points,  such  as the  mixed  ethnic  identity  of  the  population,  are  irrefutable (Buchner  ( 1978);  Ridgway  ( 1992)  111\u00ad18,(1998b),  ( 2000) 183\u00ad85),  others  are  to  a  large  degree  based  on  absence  of evidence,  and  recent  archaeological  investigations  suggest that  the  community  may  not  have  been  exclusively  a  trading station;  for  a  recent  review  of  the  status  of  Pithekoussai,  see Ridgway  ( 2000)  185\u00ad86.  The  following  should  be  noted: ( 1)  Some  kind  of  political  organisation  and  social  strati- fication is in fact suggested b y  Strabo's  report  ( 5.4.9)  of  a  stasis. ( 2)  As  Ridgway  ( 1992)  50\u00ad51  and  d'Agostino  ( 1999b) 213\u00ad17  point  out,  the  mortuary  evidence  does  actually  indi- cate  some  social  stratification. ( 3)  A  territory  seems  not  to  be  absent:  there  is  sporadic evidence  of  C 8\u00adC7  Greek  presence  over  much of  the  island, which  suggests  that  Pithekoussai  had  a  chora  and  that  the settlement  aimed  at  some  agricultural  self-sufficiency.  The extent  of  arable  land  has  been  estimated  at  c. 10\u00ad20  km \u00b2  (De Caro  ( 1994)).  At Punta  Chiarito  on  a  promontory  on  the south  coast,  c. 12  km  from  the  acropolis  of  Pithekoussai,  two LGI\u00adLGII  farmsteads,  abandoned  c. 680,  were  succeeded  in C 7s  by a  Greek  settlement  proper,  probably  destroyed  in  C 6f by  a  natural  catastrophe  (Gialanella  ( 1994)).  So  even  if Pithekoussai  may  have  been  primarily  a  commercial  settle- ment,  that  cannot  be  considered  to  be  its  only  role  (see  also d'Agostino  ( 1999b)  218\u00ad20). ( 4)  The  urban  characteristics  of  Pithekoussai  are  no  dif- ferent  from  other  C 8  western  Greek  settlements  (for  an overall  topographical  plan,  see  Buchner  and  Ridgway  ( 1993) Carta  topografica):  Pithekoussai  was  situated  on  the  island of  the  same  name  (Ps.-Skylax  10)  in  the  Gulf  of  Naples  fac- ing  Kyme  and  Cape  Misenum.  The  settlement  was  founded on  the  promontory  of  Monte  di  Vico on  the  north-west coast  of  the  island,  a  site  defended  by  natural  steep  slopes  on all  sides,  and  with  bays  forming  natural  harbours  on  both sides.  The  plateau,  relatively  flat,  formed  a  habitation  area  of about 6  ha.  Although  no  habitation  structures  are  extant, sherds  found  over  most  of  the  surface  of  the  plateau  testify to extensive C 8  habitation  (Buchner  ( 1975)  63\u00ad64).  There  is some  evidence  of  pre-colonial  trading  contacts  (Ridgway ( 1992)  107\u00ad8;  cf.  d'Agostino  ( 1999a)  56\u00ad58),  but  the  archaeo- logical  data  from  the  \"Gosetti-Akropolis  dump\"  and  from the  Mazzola  excavation  date  the  foundation  to  c. 750  (Neeft ( 1994)  150  n. 9  (\"c. 740\");  Coldstream  ( 1995);  d'Agostino ( 1999a)  56\u00ad58).  Surface  finds on the M onte  di  Vico  plateau also  give evidence  of  habitation  from  C 6  to C 4,  and  C 6\u00adC4 architectural  terracottas  are,  with  the  foundation  structures of  a  temple,  testimony  of  sanctuaries  (Coretti  and  Soverini ( 1990)  336\u00ad37;  Ridgway  ( 1992)  37\u00ad39,  86\u00ad87). The  finds from the plateau and from the \" Gosetta  dump\", and  from  the  workshop  quarter  of  Mazzola  (infra),  seem  to indicate  some  interrruption,  or  at  least  regression,  in  the habitation  of  the  site  c. 700\u00ad600,  seen  by some  as  evidence  of Kymaian  domination  in  this  period  (d'Agostino  and Soteriou  ( 1998)  368). The  principal  habitation  site  was  on  the  Monte  di  Vico,  but during  the  early  history  of  the  settlement,  habitation  also extended  along  the  ridge  of  Mezzavia  and  Mazzola,  where noteworthy  workshops  have  been  excavated  (Buchner  ( 1975); Ridgway  ( 1992)  91\u00ad101).  The  whole  area  of  Pithekoussai, including  the  Valle  di  S.  Montano  with  cemeteries,  and  the lowland  plain,  with  the  probable  harbour,  between  Monte  di Vico  and  the  ridge  of  Mezzavia,  comprises  about  75  ha (Buchner  ( 1975)  66).  Within  the  first generations after the foundation  the  population  may  have  risen  to  5,000\u00ad10,000 (Ridgway  ( 1992)  101\u00ad3).  Morris  ( 1996)  57  suggests  a  mini- mum  population  of 4,000\u00ad5,000.  A  vast  cemetery  occupies the  Valle  di  S.  Montano  south  and  south-west  of  the  Monte  di Vico,  where  the  c. 1,300  C 8\u00adC7  cremation  and  inhumation tombs  investigated  correspond  to  about  one-tenth  of  the  esti- mated  extent  of  the  cemetery  (Buchner  and  Ridgway  ( 1993)). In  terms  of  wealth,  the  cemetery  is  similar  to  those  known from  most  other  Greek  settlements  in  the  West  (Buchner ( 1982);  Ridgway  ( 1992)  50\u00ad51;  Neeft  ( 1994)  154).  The  single find of  greatest  interest  is  probably  the  late  Geometric \"Nestor's  cup\"  (C.  F.  Russo  ( 1993);  Vos  ( 1993)),  the  earliest (C 8s)  attestation  of  the  symposion  (Murray  ( 1984)).  The  C 5 tombs  are  few  and  poor  (Buchner  and  Ridgway  ( 1993)). 286 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo In  the  lower  city,  a  sanctuary,  possibly  a  Heraion,  is  like- wise  attested  by  C 7l\u00adC6e  architectural  terracottas  from Pastola,  between  the  Mazzola  ridge  and  the  sea,  west  of  the acropolis  (d'Agostino  ( 1994\u00ad95)  86\u00ad91).  A  rich  C 7e  votive deposit  from  the  same  area  has  been  taken  as  evidence  of  a heroon  on  the  assumption  that  a  tomb  found  there  was  part of  the  same  complex  as  the  deposit  (d'Agostino  ( 1994\u00ad95)). At  the  very  least,  this  evidence  suggests  that  the  political status  of  Pithekoussai  must  remain  an  open  question. Little  is  known of  the  history  of  Pithekoussai.  According to Strabo 5.4.9,  Pithekoussai  was  founded  by  Eretrians  (no. 370)  and  Chalkidians  (no. 365);  Livy  8.22.6  (cf.  Mele  ( 1979) 32)  names  only  Chalkidians.  Apart  from  this,  no  account  of the  foundation  survives.  The  settlers  found  the  site  unoccu- pied  (Buchner  ( 1975)  64),  but  mixed  marriages--evidenced by,  e.g.,  fibula t ypology--may have occurred in a later phase, c.C 8l  (Buchner  ( 1975)  77\u00ad80;  Coldstream  ( 1993)).According to  Livy  (loc.  cit.),  the  Chalkidians  moved  on  to  Kyme  (no. 57);  however,  in  the  account  of  the  foundation  of  Kyme  by Dionysios  of  Halikarnassos,  Pithekoussai  does  not  appear  as a  first stage or halting place for the Chalkidian and Eretrian founders  of  Kyme  (Ant.  Rom. 7.3.1).  According  to Strabo 5.4.7,  Pithekoussaians  participated,  with  Athenians  and Chalkidians,  in  a  resettling  of  Neapolis  at  an  unspecified date.  Hieron  of  Syracuse  constructed  a  teichos  on  the  island, but  the  personnel  had  to  abandon  it  because  of  seismic activity (Strabo  5.4.9).  The  island  was  then  taken  over  by Neapolis,  who  lost  it  in  an  unspecified war (ibid.). 66. ", "Thourioi": "Identifier: 307, (Thourios) Map  46.  Lat. 39.45,long.  16.30.

This  request  was  granted  by  the  Athenians,  who sent  ten  ships,  partly  manned  by  Peloponnesians  (Diod. 12.10.4;  Ehrenberg  ( 1965)  301).  This  expedition  may  have 304 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo been  led  by  the  Athenians  Lampon  and  Xenokrates  (Diod. 12.10.4),but  most  scholars  (cf.  infra)  refer  their  participation to  the 444/3  foundation  of  Thourioi  proper  (infra).  In  this initial  phase  of  the  foundation  of  Thourioi,  Sybaris  was reinforced  by  Athenians  and  Peloponnesians  (Diod. 12.10.4),  and  seems  indeed  still  to  have  been  called,  and located  at,  Sybaris  (coins;  cf.  RE  iv \u00b2.  1008;  Rutter  ( 1973)  163). The  community  was  strongly  dominated  by  Sybarites. However,  their  claims  to  privileges  in  political,  cultic  and economic  spheres  of  life  resulted  in  a  serious  stasis,  and  they were  put  to  death  almost  to  the  last  man  or  expelled,  thus paving  the  way  for  the  foundation  of  Thourioi  proper (Diod. 12.11.1\u00ad4;  cf.  Arist.  Pol. 1303a31\u00ad33).  These  events  probably  occurred  in  445/4  (Diod. 12.22.1).  The  foundation proper  of  Thourioi  followed  in  444/3  (in  the  archonship  of Praxiteles:  Ps.-Plut.  X  orat. 835D;  cf.  Dion.  Hal.  Lys. 1.2). According  to Diod. 12.11.3,the  victors  of  the  stasis  themselves sent  to  Hellas  for  new  settlers;  Ps.-Plut.  X  orat. 835D  seems  to think  that  Athens  was  in  charge  of  the  foundation,  whereas Dion.  Hal.  Lys. 1.2  says  that  the  colonists  were  sent  by      `.Diodorus'description of the  initial  system  of  phylai  (infra)  confirms that settlers had a  wide  variety  of  origins  ( 12.11.3;  cf. 12.35.1: ;  on  Athens'  role  in  the  foundation,  see  Rutter  ( 1973) 164\u00ad67,  arguing  that  it  has  been  exaggerated).  It  was,  pre- sumably,  this  second  group  of  colonists  from  the  mainland that  was  led  by  Lampon  and  Xenokrates  (cf.  Kagan  ( 1969) 158;  De  Sensi  Sestito  ( 1984a)  81),  though  Diod. 12.10.4  is  then guilty  of  confusion  unless  these  men  led  both  expeditions. Lampon  is  named  as  the  oikistes  by Plut.  Mor. 812D,  though other  sources  describe  him  as  a  mantis  or  exegetes  (see  refs. in  Kagan  ( 1969)  168  n. 36)  performing  only  a  temporary  task (see  Graham  ( 1964)  36\u00ad37;  Leschhorn  ( 1984)  132\u00ad33;  and Malkin  ( 1987)  254\u00ad57).The  identity  of  the  oecist  was,  in  fact, a  matter  of  dispute  which  in  434  led  to  a  stasis  that  was  solved by  reference  to the  Delphic  oracle,  which  declared  that Apollo  himself  should  be  recognised  as  the  oecist  (Diod. 12.35.3). The  name  of  the  territory  was  (Thuc. 6.61.7)  or    (Thuc. 7.35.1);  it  is  termed  at  Arist.  Pol. 1307a29ff.  Almost  immediately  after  its  foundation  the  city engaged  in  extensive  warfare,  presumably  to  secure  control of  a  sizeable  territory.  The  Spartan  exile  Kleandridas  became a  citizen  of  Thourioi  (Thuc. 6.104.2)  and  led  campaigns against  Terina  (no. 73)  (Polyaen. 2.10.1),  and  this  may  attest to  territorial  ambitions  on  the  Tyrrhenian  coast. Kleandridas  also  led  Thourian  forces  against  the  Leukanians (Polyaen. 2.10.2)  and  was  likewise  the  commander  in  a  war against  Taras  (no. 71)  (Diod. 12.23.2  (r 444))  in  which  both cities  struggled  for  influence in the S iritis  (Antiochos (FGrHist 555)  fr. 11).  Dedications  by  Taras  at  Olympia  c. 440 of  spoils  taken  from  Thourioi  (IvO 254\u00ad56  ML 57)  attest  to some  Tarantine  success,  and  the  territorial  conflict was finally ended c. 434  by  an  agreement  to found  a  joint  colony, though  in  the  name  of  Taras  (Antiochos,  loc.  cit.);  the  colony developed  into  the  city  of  Herakleia  (no. 52).  Iambl.  VP 264 attests  to  C 5s  hostilities  between  Thourioi  and  Kroton  (cf. Guzzo  ( 1986)  201),  but  according  to  Diod. 12.11.3  Thourioi established  philia  with  Kroton,  presumably  not  long  after the  foundation. Smaller  agricultural  settlements,  some  in  the  form  of single  villas,  are  above  all  known  from  the  C 4\u00adC3  territory (Osanna  ( 1992)  148\u00ad49;  Guzzo  ( 1997)  379).  The  border between  Thourian  and  Leukanian/Brettian  territory  is  not very  clear;  the  southern  Brettian  site  at  Castiglione  di  Paludi is  interpreted  as  a  Brettian  military  installation  (Osanna ( 1992)  146\u00ad49;  De  Sensi  Sestito  ( 1992)  350\u00ad53).  The  border was  marked  by  a  row  of  Thourian  phrouria,  such  as  the  one at  Torre  Mordillo,  where  a  lead  seal  carrying  the  inscription [-] has been found (Colburn (1977)  478,  521),  and  the one  at  Sierra  Castello  (Guzzo  ( 1986)  203).  One  phrourion is  known  by  name:  Lagaria,  located  somewhere  inland  \u00b5   (Strabo  6.1.14),  as  yet  not  identified w ith certainty  but  sometimes  identified w ith  the  settlement  at Amendolara  (cf.  de  La  Geni\u00e8re  ( 1991b)).  Phrouroi,  presum- ably  the  personnel  manning  these  installations,  are  referred to  by  Arist.  Pol. 1307b9.  Nothing  is  known  of  the  size  of  the population,  the  only  available  figures being army n umbers (infra). Thourioi  was  a  member  of  the  Italiote  League  (Diod. 14.91.1  (r 393)  and  101.1  (r 390);  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 230).  Some  kind of  treaty  with  Kroton  (no. 56)  soon  after  the  foundation  is implied  by Diod. 12.11.3.  The  C 5s  bronze  kerykeion  inscribed \u00b5 ,  \u00b5   and  found  at Brindisi  (IG xiv  672)  may  also  testify  to  some  formalised  col- laboration  between  the  two  communities,  possibly  during the  conflict between T aras  and  Thourioi  in  the  period  prior  to the  foundation  of  Herakleia  in  434  (Antiochos  (FGrHist 555) fr. 11;  De  Simone  ( 1956)).  This  conflict itself  was  also  ended  by a  treaty  (Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 11  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 158). According  to Thuc. 7.33.6,  Athens  (no. 361)  in  413  negotiated for  a  full  alliance  with  Thourioi;  whether  a  treaty  was  con- cluded  is  unclear,  but  Thourioi  did  assist  the  Athenian  effort against  Syracuse  (no. 47)  (Thuc. 7.35.1,  57.11;  cf.  Diod. 13.11.1 (r 413)).  However,  after  the  Athenian  defeat  at  Syracuse, Thourioi  is  found  assisting  Sparta  (no. 345)  with  naval  forces italia  and  kampania  305 (Thuc. 8.35.1,  61.2;Xen.  Hell. 1.5.9),  which  implies  a  treaty.  In 389  the  city  suffered  a  severe defeat  by the  Leukanians  but managed  to  conclude  peace  via  the  mediation  of  Leptines  of Syracuse  (Diod. 14.101.1\u00ad102.3).  A  little  after  379,  Dionysios  I sent  a  navy  against  Thourioi  without  success  (Ael.  VH 12.61 with  Jacquemin  ( 1979)).  Collaboration  with  Corinthian forces  sent  out  to reinforce Timoleon  is  attested  at  Plut.  Tim. 16.2.In 356  the  city  was  subdued  by  the  Brettians  (Diod. 16.15.2;  cf.  Plut.  Tim. 16.2). In 413,  Thourioi  assisted  the  Athenian  attack  on  Syracuse with 700  hoplites  and  300  akontistai  (Thuc. 7.35.1).Naval  forces (ten  ships)  are  attested  at  Thuc. 8.35.1,  commanded  by  Dorieus tritos  autos  (cf.  Thuc. 8.61.2  and  Xen.  Hell. 1.5.19).A  contingent of 14,000  pezoi  and  c. 1,000  horse  is  recorded  by Diod. 14.101.2 (r 390).  A  board  of  strategoi  was  elected  by  the  assembly  (  \u00b5  ... );  a  law  stipulated  a  five-year peri- od  between  strategiai;  but  the  law  was  repealed,  and  this  start- ed  off  a  process  by  which  the  constitution  developed  into  a dynasteia  of  the  young  reformers  (Arist.  Pol. 1307b6\u00ad19).  Plato may  allude  to  this  event  at  Leg. 636B,  where  he  describes  gym- nasia  and  sysitia  as  breeding  grounds  of  young  citizens inclined  to  revolution.  The  Spartan  exile  Kleandridas  became a  citizen  of  Thourioi  (Thuc. 6.104.2;Plut.  Per. 22.3)  and  served as  strategos  in  wars  against  Taras  (Strabo  6.1.14),  Terina  and  the Leukanians  (Polyaen. 2.10.1\u00ad2). Reception of  envoys is  recorded by Thuc. 6.104.2  and sending  of  envoys  at  Diod. 14.101.2  (r 390).  F.Delphes iii.4388 ( 325\u00ad300)  may  possibly  be  a  grant  by  Delphi  (no. 177)  of proxeny,  etc.  to  a  man  of  Thourioi.  A  man  of  Thourioi  was granted  hereditary  citizenship  and  other  honours  by  Zeleia (no. 764)  in  the  Propontis  c. 330\u00ad300  (AM 9  ( 1884)  58\u00ad60  no. 3  Michel 531).  Theorodokoi  of  Epidauros  (no. 348)  at Thourioi  are  attested  by  IG iv\u00b2.195.ii.43,  52  (C 4m). A  system  of  phylai  was  established  soon  after  the  founda- tion,  in  which  the  citizens  were  enrolled  on  the  basis  of  their origin;  the  ten  phylai  were  named:  Arkas,  Acha\u00efs,  Eleia, Boiotia,  Amphiktyonis,  Doris,  Ias,  Athena\u00efs,  Eubo\u00efs  and Nesiotis  (Diod. 12.11.3;  see  Jones,  POAG 165\u00ad67). According  to Diod. 12.11.3\u00ad4,  Thourioi  was  founded  as  a democracy,  and  the  city's  law  code  was  drawn  up  by Charondas  of  Thourioi  (apparently  a  namesake  of  the famous  legislator  of  the  Archaic  period,  pace  M\u00fchl,  Klio 22 ( 1929)  439),but  Heraclid.  Pont.  tells  us  that  it  was  Protagoras of  Abdera  who  wrote  the  laws  (fr. 150,Wehrli  Diog.  Laert. 9.8.50).  It  has  been  suggested  that  he  based  his  laws  on  those of  Charondas  and  Zaleukos  (De  Sensi  Sestito  ( 1984a)  82). Several  staseis  are  recorded  (Berger  ( 1992)  33\u00ad34);  one involved  the  identity  of  the  oecist  (Diod. 12.35.3  (r 434))  and in  another  anti-Athenians  were  defeated  and  exiled  (Thuc. 7.33.5\u00ad6;  Berger  ( 1992)  33).  In  413,  however,  after  the Athenian  defeat  at  Syracuse, 300  pro-Athenians  were  exiled, one  of  them  Lysias  (Dion.  Hal.  Lys. 1;Plut.  Mor. 835E). Aristotle  refers  to  two  further  staseis,  both  perhaps  posterior to 413:  the  first ( Pol. 1307a27\u00ad33)  is  given  as  an  example  of change  from  oligarchy  in  the  direction  of  democracy:  the passage  testifies t o the  existence  of  a  property qualification for  office holding ( archai);  the  qualification was lowered and  the  number  of  magistracies  (archeia)  increased  after pressure  from  the  demos;  the  chronological  reference  is uncertain  (De  Sensi  Sestito  ( 1992)  344ff:  440s;  Berger  ( 1992) 33\u00ad34:  c. 413).  The  city  seems  to  have  attempted  control  of land  ownership,  even  among  its  own  citizens;  but  large  land- holdings  were  acquired  unconstitutionally  by  the  gnorimoi and  had  to  be  given  up  by  the  owners  after  a  stasis  (Arist.  Pol. 1307a29\u00ad33;  Jacquemin  ( 1979)). The  second  passage  (Pol. 1307b6\u00ad19)  describes  a  process by  which  the  constitution  developed  (from  a  democracy?) into  a  dynasteia  of  young  military  leaders  (supra);  the chronological  reference  is  again  uncertain.  The  passage  tes- tifies t o  the  existence  of  symboloi:  they  seem  to  have  been entrusted  with  general  supervision  of  the  constitution;  the passage  also  refers  to archontes  in  general. Thourioi  was  situated  on  part  of  the  site  of  Archaic  Sybaris (no. 70.I),  and  the  assertion  by  Diod. 12.10.3  (cf.  Strabo  6.1.13) that  the  city  was  moved  to  another  site  is  not  convincing  in view  of  the  archaeological  evidence.  According  to  Diod. 12.10.6  (rC 5s),  the  city  had  a  circuit  wall,  not  archaeologically attested  so  far.  The  city  was  laid  out  with  four  plateiai  and three  stenopoi,  named  respectively  Herakleia,  Aphrodisia, Olympias,  Dionysias,  and  Heroa,  Thuria,  Thurina  (Diod. 12.10.7;  Castagnoli  ( 1971);  for  the  textual  problems,  see  Vallet ( 1976)  1030\u00ad32;  Lapini  ( 1997)).  Hippodamos  is  called Thourian  in  some  traditions,  and  the  town  plan  of  Thourioi has  been  attributed  to  him,  though  the  tradition  is  ambigu- ous  (see  e.g.  E.  Greco ( 1997)).  Whether  the  streets  named  by Diodorus  correspond  to  twelve  city  quarters  distributed  to the  tribes,  also  listed  by  Diodorus  (supra),  is  doubtful  (Vallet ( 1976)  1027\u00ad28),  but  the  overall  orthogonal  urban  layout  as described  by  Diodorus  has  found  confirmation in the archae- ological  evidence:  the  C 5l\u00adC4f  city  plan  was  orthogonal,  and the  sporadic  remains  of  habitation  are  oriented  according  to the  urban  layout  (infra;  cf.  E.  Greco  ( 1997)  437\u00ad38;recent investigation  of  Hippodamian  layout:  E.  Greco  and  Luppino ( 1999)).  The  technique  of  construction  of  the  sparse  habita- tion  remains  is  rather  similar  to  that  of  Archaic  Sybaris (Guzzo  ( 1988\u00ad89)  20\u00ad23,  87,  178,  240\u00ad48,  290\u00ad304,  365).  There 306 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo are  overall  traces  of  a  levelling  of  the  remains  of  the  Sybarite phase  in  preparation  for  the  foundation  of  Thourioi  (ibid. 23).  An  east\u00adwest-oriented  plateia,  going  back  to  the  time  of foundation  (ibid. 20),terminated  near  the  coast  in  C 4(?)  har- bour  structures  of  uncertain  use  (Zancani  Montuoro ( 1972\u00ad73b)).  Remains  of  public  architecture  are  meagre,  and the  extant  structures  are  mainly  ascribable  to  Roman  Copia. The  agora  is  mentioned  at  Theophr.  fr. 97,  but  the  tradition that  Herodotos  was  buried  there  is  rejected  outright  by Jacoby (RE  suppl.  ii. 214),although  there  can  be  no  doubt  that Herodotos  was  a  citizen  of  Thourioi  (Arist.  Rh. 1409a28)  and probably  moved  to Thourioi  in  444/3  (Plut.  Mor. 604F). A  cult  of  Athena  may  be  inferred  from  coin  types  (infra). A  cult  of  Boreas  was  instituted  by  decree  in  C 4f(Ael.  VH 12.61)  after  this  divinity  had  wrecked  a  navy  of  Dionysios  I on  its  way  to  Thourioi;  Boreas  was  voted  citizenship,  and  an annual  festival  instituted  (Jacquemin  ( 1979)).  The  cults  of Sybaris  and  Thourioi  are  not  always  easily  separated  (cf. Giannelli  ( 1963)  101\u00ad16).  The  cult  of  Hera is  documented  for Sybaris  (see  Sybaris  (no. 70.I))  and  may  have  continued  in Thourioi,  though  the  coin  type  of  Hera  Lakinia  (infra) probably  has  no  connection  with  the  Sybarite  cult  of  Hera (cf.  Giannelli  ( 1963)  103).  C 3  numismatic  evidence  may  sug- gest  at  least  C 3  cults  of  Apollo,  Demeter  and  Artemis  (SNG Cop.  Italy 1507\u00ad10,  1513\u00ad18).A  cult  of  Apollo  is  also  suggested by  the  tradition  of  Apollo  as  the  oikistes  (supra;  and  cf. Giannelli  ( 1963)  105).The  division  of  Thourioi  into  quarters by  streets  named  after  Herakles,  Aphrodite,  the  Olympian Zeus  and  Dionysos  (Diod. 12.10.7)  may  indicate  cults  of these  divinities.  A  cult  of  Diomedes  at  Thourioi  is  attested  at Polemon,  FGH iii  122  no. 23. Communal  consultation  of  the  Delphic  oracle  is  record- ed  in  Diod. 12.35.3  (r 434).  Syll. \u00b3295  (C 4)  is  a  Delphic  decree confirming an earlier g rant  of  promanteia  to  Thourioi (Roux  ( 1990);  Gauthier,  BE  ( 1991)  486\u00ad87  no. 306).  A  grant by  an  individual  Thourian  towards  the  rebuilding  of  the Delphic  temple  is  recorded  in  CID ii  23.8  ( 341/40). Damon  of  Thourioi  was  victorious  at  Olympia  in  376 (Olympionikai 403:  stadion  race)  and  in  372  (Olympionikai 407:  stadion).  The  Rhodian  exile  Dorieus  won  several Panhellenic  victories  also  at  Nemea,  Isthmia  and  Delphi (Syll. \u00b382;  Olympionikai 322);  he  was  a  Thourian  citizen (Xen.  Hell. 1.5.19)  and  participated  at  Olympia,  etc.  as  a Thourian  (Paus. 6.7.4),  as  did  his  relative  Peisidoros  (ibid.; Olympionikai 356);  cf.  Pugliese  Carratelli  ( 1972\u00ad73)  29. Thourioi  struck  coins  in  silver  from  c. 440  on  the  Achaian standard;  denominations:  distaters,  staters  and  triobols (Rutter  ( 1979)  44\u00ad45;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  p. 146).  Thourioi  took over  the  types  of  Sybaris  (no. 70.IV)  with  some  changes:  obv. head  of  Athena  wearing  Attic  helmet,  reflecting A thenian influence;  rev.  bull,  derived  from  Sybaris  but  with  butting head,  or,  later,  charging,  and  with  fish in e xergue.  Legend  on rev. ;  some  issues  have  initials  or  symbols  of magistrates  or  names  of  die-engravers  (Rutter,  HN \u00b31770ff; SNG  Cop.  Italy 1405\u00ad30,  1432\u00ad63  (distaters,  staters); 1470\u00ad88 (triobols)).  The  exceptionally  abundant  issues  of  distaters and  staters  suggests  that  Thourioi  had  ample  stocks  of  silver, perhaps  in  the  form  of  bullion  brought  from  Athens  (Kraay ( 1976)  184\u00ad85).One  specimen  has  obv.  head  of  Hera  Lakinia, a  Kampanian  type  and  a  unique  example  of  die  sharing  by  a Kampanian  mint  and  a  Thourian  mint  (Rutter  ( 1979)  60\u00ad61; Rutter,  HN \u00b3  1796;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1431).  Bronzes  were  issued early  and  nearly  contemporary  with  the  silver  coinage, employing  the  same  types  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  1903ff;  SNG  Cop. Italy 1494\u00ad1506). italia  and  kampania  307", "Pandosia": "Identifier: 65. , (Pandosinos) Map  46.  Unlocated  (see  fur- ther  Ciaceri  ( 1928)ii.  158\u00ad60;  Storti  ( 1994)  331\u00ad32);  probably near  Cosentia  in  the  upper  Krathis  valley,  by  the  river Acheron  (Strabo  6.1.5;  coins,  infra);  not  to  be  confused  with Pandosia  in  the  territory  of  Herakleia  (no. 52).

Pandosia  is  one  of  ten  toponyms  listed  at  Ps.-Skylax  12 after  the  heading    ` ,where polis is  used  in  the  urban  sense.  The  internal  collective  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  found  (as  ) on Classical coins (infra).  The  external  individual  use  is  found  in  IG vii 2225B.54  (C 2f). Ps.-Skymnos  326\u00ad29  describes  Pandosia  (with  Kroton (no. 56),  Thourioi  (no. 74)  and  Metapontion  (no. 61))  as  an Achaian  foundation.  Numismatic  evidence  (infra)  suggests that  the  city  was  a  dependency  of  Sybaris  (no. 70)  and  later of  Kroton  (cf.  Mazzarino  ( 1963)  69;  Storti  ( 1994)  332  with refs.).  According  to  Eusebios  (Helm  181;  Sch\u00f6ne 78),  the foundation  of  Pandosia  was  contemporary  with  that  of Metapontion:  Ol. 1.4  773;  it  is  not,  however,  clear  whether the  reference  is  to this  Pandosia  or  the  one  near  Herakleia (RE  xviii. 551;  Storti  ( 1994)  332).  In  any  case,  the  Eusebian date  for  Metapontion  is  unreliable.  According  to  Strabo 6.1.5,  tradition  held  that  Pandosia  was  once  the  royal  seat  of the  Oinotrians. By c. 500  Pandosia  with  Kroton  struck  staters  on  the Achaian  standard  and  with  the  incuse  technique:  obv.tripod, legend ;  rev.  bull  of  Sybarite  type  within  incuse  square, legend: (Gorini  ( 1975)  27;  Parise  ( 1982)  105\u00ad6,  114; Stazio  ( 1983b)  967\u00ad69;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  2097).  The  legends  and the  obv.  type  suggest  dependency  upon  Kroton,  but  the  rev. type  depicting  the  Sybarite  bull  suggests  earlier  dependence upon  Sybaris  (RE  xviii. 552:  Giangiulio  ( 1989)  233  n. 67).  By C 5s  Pandosia  was  striking  staters  of  its  own  in  double  relief: obv.  head  of  nymph  Pandosia,  legend: ;  rev. naked  youth  offering  libation,  personification of  river Krathis,  legend: (Rutter,HN\u00b32449).C.400,staters and  thirds  depict  obv.  head  of  Hera  Lakinia;  rev.  seated,  naked Pan  with  dog,  in  front  herm  with  kerykeion  affixed,  legend: ,  ,  in  field mint-mark  ,  similar to  mint-marks  known  from  Hyele,  Neapolis,  Thourioi  and other  mints  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  2450\u00ad52). 65.

Barr.  locates  Siris  c. 5  km  south  of  Herakleia Leukania  in  accordance  with  one  literary  tradition  which suggests  separate  locations  for  the  two  sites  (infra). However,  in  our  entries  for  Siris  and  Herakleia  Leukania  we locate  both  communities  on  the  plateau  of  modern Policoro,  a  location  suggested  by  the  archaeological  evi- dence  and  at  present  widely  accepted.  Size  of  territory:  ? Type:  A.  The  toponym  is ,  (SEG 19  618  (C 6\u00adC5); Hdt. 8.62.2);  on  the  name (Mir.  ausc. 106;Strabo 6.1.14;  Steph.  Byz. 531.12),  see  infra. (),  which  prop- erly  denotes  the  territory,  is  sometimes  used  almost  as  a toponym  (Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)fr.  12;Strabo  6.1.14). The  city-ethnic  is (Hdt. 6.127.1); of  the  C 6 coin  legends  may  also  be  the  city-ethnic  (infra):  Steph.  Byz. 572.12  lists  this  as  a  form  of  the  ethnic. Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 12  should  probably  be  emend- ed  to read    ,     ... &lt;   &gt;;  if  accepted,  the  text  calls  Siris  a  polis in,  primarily,  the  territorial  sense,  with  the  urban  sense  as  a connotation.  The  external  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is found  in  Timaios  (FGrHist 566)  fr. 51  (rC 7)  apud  Ath. 12.232C;  the  external  individual  use  is  found  in  Hdt. 6.127.1 (rC 6f).  Siris  is  implicitly  described  as  patre  (  patris)  in Hdt. 6.127.1\u00ad4. The  literary  tradition  presents  a  number  of  traditions  on the  origin,  foundation  and  early  history  of  Siris;  the  evid- ence  is  quite  confusing  and  difficult t o  correlate  with  the archaeological  evidence  (see  e.g.  Lombardo  ( 1986);  Sacchi ( 1990);  Osborne  ( 1998)  265\u00ad67).  A  synthesis  yields  the  fol- lowing  picture. According  to  Strabo 6.1.14,  Ionians  fleeing  from  Lydian rule  conquered  a  non-Greek  (Chonian)  polis  and  changed the  name  from  Siris  to  Polieion  (cf.  Mir.  ausc. 106;Steph. Byz. 531.11,  572.10;  Etym.  Magn. 680.11),  a  name  that  is,  how- ever,  not  often  found  in  the  sources  relating  to  the  Greek city.  Strabo  does  not  specify  who  these  Ionians  were  or  the date  of  their  capture  of  Siris;  but  Ath. 12.523C(  Arist.  fr. 601)  and  Timaeus  (  FGrHist 566,fr.  51)  identifies  them  as from  Kolophon  (no. 848),  and  since  Gyges  (c. 680\u00ad645)is known  to  have  conquered  Kolophon  (Hdt. 1.14.4),  a  syn- chronisation  of  the  capture  of  Kolophon  and  the  founda- tion  of  Polieion  would  produce  a  foundation  date  of c. 660  (Ronconi  ( 1980);  Lombardo  ( 1986)  63\u00ad64).  The  his- toricity  of  this  tradition  of  a  Kolophonian  foundation  was rejected  by  Beloch  ( 1894)  606\u00ad7,  but  is  accepted  by Demand  ( 1990)  31\u00ad33;a  C 6e\u00adm  loom  weight  inscribed  in the  Ionian  alphabet  may  possibly  support  an  Ionian  pres- ence  at  Siris  (LSAG 286).  The  foundation  date  of  c. 660 implied  by  the  synchronisation  with  Gyges'  capture  of Kolophon  does  not  square  well  with  the  archaeological  evi- dence,  which  points  to  a  foundation  date  of  C 8l\u00adC7e. Strabo's  report  ( 6.1.14)  that  Siris  was  a  Rhodian  foundation is  unique. According  to  Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 12,  Sybaris  (no. 70.I)  invited  Achaian  colonists  to  settle  in  Italy  to  create  a buffer  against  Taras  (no. 71);  two  sites  were  at  the  disposal  of the  settlers,  Metapontion  and  Siris,  and  the  Sybarites advised  settling  Metapontion  since  the  new  community would  then  also  control  Siris.  This  seems  to  imply  that  Siris lay  empty  or  was  controlled  by  Sybaris;  Just.  Epit. 20.2.4 reports  that  an  alliance  of  Metapontion  (no. 61),  Sybaris ( 70.I)  and  Kroton  (no. 56)  conquered  Siris,  and  this  would seem  the  probable  occasion  after  which  Sybaris  could  con- trol  Siris;  this  conquest  is  usually  dated  to  C 6f  (Giangiulio ( 1989)  249\u00ad50;  Sacchi  ( 1990)  151)  and  archaeological  evid- ence  confirms a c.C 6m  destruction  of  Siris  (Adamesteanu ( 1975b)  527).  But  Metapontion  seems  to  have  been  founded c. 630  (see  the  entry  for  Metapontion),  and  in  any  case  the city  can  hardly  have  participated  in  the  war  that  provided the  preconditions  for  its  own  foundation.  This  combination of  the  evidence,  then,  runs  into  difficulties.  Furthermore, Siris  seems  to  have  existed  and  minted  coins  in  C 6l  (infra), italia  and  kampania  293 and  with  legends  in  Achaian  script.  According  to  Just.  Epit. 20.2.10,  Siris  was  allied  to  Lokroi  (no. 59)  during  the  conflict with  Metapontion,  Sybaris  and  Kroton. Though  Hdt. 8.62.1  may  imply  that  Siris  was  unoccupied in  C 5e,  it  does  seem  to  have  been  occupied  when  Taras  (no. 71)  and  Thourioi  (no. 74)  fought  for  control  of  the  site  short- ly  after  the  foundation  of  Thourioi;  the  war  was  ended  by  a mutual  agreement  between  the  two  cities  to  found  a  joint colony  (Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 11;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 158). Diod. 12.36.4  dates  the  foundation  of  this  colony  to  433/2, and  he  reports  that  it  was  founded  at  the  site  of  Siris, whose  inhabitants  were  deported.  According  to  Antiochos (FGrHist 555)  fr. 11,\"Herakleia\"was  not  the  original  name  of the  colony:  the  city  was  thus  named  only  after  having changed  its  initial  location.  A  combination  of  Diodorus  and Antiochos  would  suggest  that  the  city  was  originally  found- ed  as  Siris  on  the  site  of  Siris,  but  later  relocated  and  then named  Herakleia;  such  a  reconstruction  is  not,  however, supported  by  the  archaeological  evidence,  which  clearly shows  Herakleia  to  have  occupied  the  site  identified w ith Siris  (see  further  the  entry  for  Herakleia).  According  to Strabo  6.1.14,  Siris  served  as  the  epineion  of  Herakleia,  but the  reference  here  is  not  to the  historical  Greek  Siris,  but  to a legendary  Siris,  a  polis  Troike,  of  which  there  are  no  archaeo- logical  remains.  So,  by  the  430s  Siris  had  been  replaced  by Herakleia  (no. 52). The  territory is  called  ()  (Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 3;  Arist.  Pol. 1329b21).  The  sources  refer  to  a  founda- tion  near  the  river  Siris,  but  there  is  no  archaeological  evid- ence  for  such  a  site,  and  Siris  is  therefore  normally  identified with  the  settlement  on  the  hill  of  Policoro  (infra).  The archaeological  evidence  indicates  Greek  settlers  on  the plateau  of  Policoro  from  C 8l,  and  the  Kolophonian  settlers (supra)  therefore  had  Greek  predecessors.  Greek  presence  in the  Siritis  from  the  C 8s  has  been  documented  at  other  sites also,  most  importantly  at  Incoronata  c. 18  km  to the  north  of Siris.  Incoronata  had  a  cultural  appearance  very  similar  to that  of  Siris,  and  the  site  is  therefore  interpreted  as  an  empo- rion  of  this  city,  located  on  the  northern  border  of  Sirite ter- ritory  (Orlandini  ( 1986a),  ( 1986b));  it  was  destroyed  by Metapontion  (no. 61)  at  the  time  of  the  foundation  of  that city  c. 630  (Osanna  ( 1992)  40\u00ad42;  Sacchi  ( 1990)  esp. 146\u00ad59). Ionian  influence was curtailed b y  the  foundation  of Metapontion  and  so  confined w ithin  the  valley  of  the  river Cavone  from  C 7s.  The  northern  border  of  Siris'  territory centred  upon  the  Hellenised  indigenous  settlement  at Termitito  (Osanna  ( 1992)  94).  The  chora  of  Siris  extended along  the  coast  and  somewhat  inland  along  the  Sinni  and Agri  river  valleys,  as  attested  by  the  border  sites  of  S.  Maria d'Anglona  and  Piano  Sollazzo,  which  are  Hellenised  from C 7s,  but  the  influence of  Siris  undoubtedly  reached  the Tyrrhenian  coast  (Osanna  ( 1992)  92\u00ad96,  109\u00ad10).  To  the south  the  territory  was  bounded  by  the  Siris  valley  and beyond  that  by  Sybarite  territory.  There  is  no  evidence  of sanctuaries  in  the  territory of  Siris  prior  to the  foundation  of Herakleia  (Osanna  ( 1992)  96). The  C 8l\u00adC7e  settlement  founded  on  the  narrow,  coastal east\u00adwest  oriented  plateau  (c. 1,700 100/150  m),  modern Policoro,  is  here  identified w ith  Siris.  The  easternmost  part of  the  plateau  was  fortified on its w est  side  by  a  ditch  and forms  an  acropolis  (H\u00e4nsel  ( 1973)  401\u00ad4  fig. 1,  429\u00ad41, 443\u00ad46,  461\u00ad63).  Remains  of  C 7\u00adC6  mudbrick  circuit  walls along  the  edge  of  the  Policoro  plateau  (H\u00e4nsel  ( 1973) 429\u00ad43,  492;  Adamesteanu  ( 1980b)  82\u00ad85)  show  that  habita- tion,  although  concentrated  in  separate  areas,  covered  most of  the  plateau.  The  sporadic  structural  remains  on  the plateau  (Adamesteanu  and  Dilthey  ( 1978)  521\u00ad25  fig. 12)  and ashlar  foundations  of  two  large  structures  (temples?)  on  the acropolis  date  from  c. 700  (Adamesteanu  ( 1980b)  76\u00ad78). There  are  traces  of  habitation  and  workshops  also  outside and  south  of  the  plateau;  the  location  of  several  cemeteries seems  to  indicate  separate  nuclei  of  habitation  areas (Tagliente  ( 1986a),  ( 1986b)).  The  archaeological  evidence confirms a destruction c.C 6m  (  the  Achaian  conquest  of Just.  Epit. 20.3.4?),  but  there  are  also  some  signs  of  continu- ous  settlement  (Adamesteanu  ( 1975b)  527).The  vast  C 5  pub- lic  area,  an  agora(?),  on  the  southern  slope  above  the sanctuary  of  the  \"Archaic  Temple\",  may  have  had  an  Archaic origin.  Sanctuaries  were  located  at  springs  rising  on  the southern  slope  of  the  plateau.  The  sanctuary  of  Demeter identified b y  C 5\u00adC4  epigraphic  evidence  (Neutsch  ( 1967) 13436,  ( 1980))  originated  in  C 8l\u00adC7e  (Adamesteanu ( 1980b)  78  n. 24,  86\u00ad87  with  refs.;  ( 1982)  301,  303  fig. 2;for scepticism  on  the  evidence,  see  Hinz  ( 1998)  193\u00ad94).  The divinity  of  the  C 6e  \"Archaic  Temple\"  to  the  west  of  the Demeter  sanctuary  is  unknown;  cult  was  practised  from C 7m  (Adamesteanu  ( 1974)  97,(1980b)  87\u00ad88;  Mertens-Horn and  Viola  ( 1990)  249\u00ad50).  Further  west,  yet  another  sanctu- ary  with  remains  of  two  or  three  C 6l  naiskoi  and  votive material  testify  to  the  overall  public  character  of  the  south- ern  slope  of  the  plateau.  The  cult  is  uncertain,  though  a votive pinax  found  on  the  site  with  a  representation  of Apollo  and  Herakles  may  point  to  these  divinities  (Neutsch ( 1980)  153\u00ad54).  Fragments  of  late  Archaic  architectural  terracottas  found  above  in  the  western  area  of  the  plateau have been  taken  as  evidence  of  one  or  more  naiskoi 294 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo (Adamesteanu  and  Dilthey  ( 1978)  525  fig. 53;  Adamesteanu ( 1980b)  88\u00ad89).  The  major  urban  cult  was  that  of  Athena Ilias,  presumably  the  patron  divinity  (Mir.  ausc. 106;Strabo 6.1.14).  Other  evidence  of  cult  includes  a  C 6l\u00adC5e  bronze plaque  listing  objects,  in  Achaian  script,  belonging  to  the sanctuary,  epi  Siri  and  epi  dromo,  of  a  female  divinity  which is  with  some  uncertainty  identified as H era,  Athena  or Demeter  (Guarducci  ( 1958)  52,  57\u00ad58:C6s;  LSAG 287:  c. 475; Guarducci,  EG  i. 117\u00ad18).  Circumstantial  evidence  suggests  a cult  of  Artemis  Bendis  (H\u00e4nsel  ( 1973)  457).  The  Archaic cemeteries  are  found  on  the  outermost  western  part  of  the plateau,  with  evidence  of  burials  inside  the  circuit  wall (Adamesteanu  ( 1975b)  526\u00ad27,(1980a)),  but  mainly  in  an extensive  area  to  the  west  of  the  plateau  (Contrade Cerchiarito,  Schirone  and  Madonelle)  (Adamesteanu  ( 1974) 111\u00ad16).  Such  separate  well-defined c emeteries  point  to  sep- arate  nuclei  of  settlement.  The  funerary  road,  later  the  con- tinuation  of  the  plataia  of  Herakleia,  was  originally  an important  artery  of  the  territory,  also  leading  to  the  chora  of Dionysos  known from  C 4  but  possibly  of  more  ancient  ori- gin  (see  the  entry  for  Herakleia  Leukania). An  architectural  fragment  from  Olympia  has  been  taken as  evidence  of  a  treasury  of  Siris  (Mertens-Horn  and  Viola ( 1990)  242). Siris  may  have  minted  coins.An  issue  of  C 6s  incuse  staters on  the  Achaian  standard  carry  the  Sybarite  type  of  a  bull looking  back  and  double  legends  in  the  Achaian  alphabet: obv. (retr.),  rev. or (Gorini ( 1975)  9,  95\u00ad98;  Sternberg  ( 1980);  Rutter,  HN \u00b3  1722;  SNG Cop.  Italy 1387;  SNG  Cop.  Suppl. 53).  A  single  third-stater with  obv.  legend is  attested  (Sternberg  ( 1980)  127,  139; Moscati  Castelnuovo  ( 1989)  94  n. 7;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  1727).  The interpretation  of  these  coins  is  uncertain.  The  legend is  either  a  city-ethnic  of  Siris  or  a  toponym (Sirinos;  see  Pyxous  (no. 67)).  If  it  is  the  city-ethnic  of  Siris, the  coinage  may  be  a  joint  issue  of  Siris  and  Pyxous,  though it  is  a  problem  that  the  two  sites  are  situated  far  apart,  or  of Siris  and  some  otherwise  unknown  locality  near  Siris  (cf. Gallo  ( 1996)  97\u00ad100).  The  initial  issue  is  normally  dated c. 550\u00ad540  (Moscati  Castelnuovo  ( 1989)  94\u00ad100;Sternberg ( 1980)  unconvincingly  interprets  the  early  Siris  coinage  as  a prototype  for  Sybaris'  coinage  and  dates  it  560\u00ad550).  The Sybarite  bull  type  dates  the  issue  to  after  the  destruction  of Siris  by  Sybaris  et al.(supra),  and  the  coinage  therefore  represents  a  Siris  within  Sybaris'  dominion,  rather  than  an issue  of  an  independent  city  (cf.  Parise  ( 1972)  102\u00ad4;Guzzo ( 1989)  41,  46).  The  coinage  has  been  divided  into  four  series (Libero  Mangieri  ( 1981)  or  into  two  series  (Sternberg ( 1980))  terminating  c. 510  contemporary  with  the  fall  of Sybaris. 70.

The  toponym  is , (ML 10.6\u00ad7  ( 550\u00ad525));  (Ps.-Skylax  12;Strabo 6.4.13);  or  , (Ps.- Skymnos  248).  The  city-ethnic  is  (C 5f coins,  infra); (Aristox.  fr. 124,  Wehrli),  or (Hdt. 1.167.4). Poseidonia  is  one  of  ten  toponyms  listed  at  Ps.-Skylax  12 after  the  heading    ` ,where polis is  used  in  the  urban  sense,  and  it  is  called  a  polis  in  the  polit- ical  sense  in  ML  10.7  ( 550\u00ad525).  The  internal  collective  use  of the  city-ethnic  is  found  on  C 5f  coins  (infra);  the  external collective  use  is  found  in  Aristox.  fr. 124,  Wehrli,  and  Strabo 6.1.3  (rC 5l\u00adC4e);  the  external  individual  use  is  found  in Iambl.

According  to  Solin. 2.10,  the city  was  founded  by  unspecified Dorians;  if  historical,  these Dorians  may  have  been  Troizenians  (no. 357),  since,  accord- ing  to  Arist.  Pol. 1303a30,  Troizenians  had  participated  in  the foundation  of  Sybaris  itself  (cf.  Steph.  Byz. 639.9,where Steph.  associates  the  toponym  Troizen  with  Italy  and  cites Charax FGrHist 103,fr.  61).  The  literary  tradition  offers only  a  terminus  ante  quem  for  the  foundation,  viz.  c. 530,pro- vided  by  Herodotos,  who  at  1.167.4  refers  to  the  city  as  in existence  when  Hyele  (no. 54)  was  founded  (c. 540\u00ad535). Archaeological  evidence  suggests  a  foundation  date  of  c. 600 (E.  Greco  ( 1981a);  Poseidonia  ii. 73  n. 7).  At  Strabo  6.1.1  an initial  Sybarite  settlement  distinct  from  the  later  city  is  mentioned  and  described  as  a  teichos;  the  location  and  sta- tus  of  this  teichos  is  still  unsolved  (Greco  ( 1979);  Tr\u00e9ziny ( 1992);  Junker  ( 1993)  2\u00ad3). Suburban  sanctuaries  of  Demeter(?)  3\u00ad4  km  to  the  east  of Poseidonia  and  of  Artemis(?)  (cf.  Diod. 4.22.3.)  reflect the C 6e  expansion  of  the  city's  influence (E.  Greco  ( 1987a) 480\u00ad81).  The  C 6\u00adC5  chora  of  Poseidonia  was  delimited  to the  north  by  the  river  Sele  and  the  important  sanctuary  of Hera (infra),  to  the  east  by  the  foothills  bordering  the  coastal plain,  and  to  the  south  by  the  sanctuary  of  Poseidon(?)  at Agropoli  (Fiammenghi  ( 1985a)).  Other  important  extra- urban  sanctuaries  of  Demeter  and  Hera  are  known  at  S.  Nicola  di  Albanella  (Cipriani  ( 1989);  Cipriani  and Ardovino  ( 1989\u00ad90);  Hinz  ( 1998)  176\u00ad80)  and  at  Fonte, 14 km  from  Poseidonia  (E.  Greco  ( 1979)  19).  Greek  and  indige- nous  graves  respectively  mark  the  boundary  of  Poseidonian territory c. 14  km  to the  east  of  the  city.  There  is  evidence  of an  Archaic  Greek  rural  settlement  near  the  Heraion  at  the Foce  del  Sele  and  of  harbour  installations  on  the  estuary  of the  river  Sele.  The  C 6\u00adC5  territory  of  Poseidonia  comprised about 200  km \u00b2  (E.  Greco  ( 1979);  Greco,  Stazio  and  Vallet ( 1987)). The  most  important  of  the  extra-urban  sanctuaries  was the  Heraion  located  on  the  left  bank  of  the  river  Sele (ancient  Silaris)  close  to the  estuary,  on  the  northern  border of  Poseidonian  territory (Strabo  6.1.1;  Solin. 2.7).  The  evidence  suggests  that  the  foundation  of  the  Heraion  was contemporary  with  the  foundation  of  Poseidonia  (Tocco Sciarelli  et al.( 1989)  67\u00ad90).  On  the  sanctuary,  see  Zancani Montuoro  and  Zanotti-Bianco  ( 1951\u00ad54);  Parise  Badoni ( 1989);  de  La  Geni\u00e8re  ( 1997b).  The  cult  of  Demeter  is  attest- ed  at  several  sanctuaries  in  the  chora  (Cipriani  and  Ardovino ( 1989\u00ad90)). In  ML  10.7,  a treaty  of  symmachia  between  Sybaris  (no. 70.I)  with  allies  and  the  Serdaioi,  Poseidonia  is  listed  as  prox- enos  of  the  agreement;  Poseidonia  itself  here  appears  to  be outside  the  Sybarite  alliance,  and  its  function  as  proxenos  is italia  and  kampania  287 not  easy  to  interpret  (ML  ad  loc.);  however,  the  inscription attests  the  ability  of  Poseidonia  to conduct  foreign  policy and  to  enter  into  interstate  relations.  According  to  Strabo 6.1.3,  Poseidonia  had  a  number  of  symmachoi  in  C 5l\u00adC4e when  the  city  was  defeated  by  the  Leukanians.  A  war  of uncertain  date  with  Hyele  (no. 54)  is  attested  in  Strabo  6.1.1. Poseidonia  was  conquered  by  the  Leukanians  in  C 5l\u00adC4e, probably  after  the  fall  of  Kyme  (E.  Greco  ( 1992b)  249). During  C 4s  the  Greek  identity  of  the  community  was effaced,  and  the  Greek  language  was  no  longer  spoken (Aristox.  fr. 124,  Wehrli),  but  though  the  Poseidoniatai  are described  as  \"wholly  barbarianized\"  (Aristox.  fr. 124, Wehrli),  the  persistence  of  at  least  one  ancient  Greek  reli- gious  festival  is  reported  (ibid.;  cf.  Ampolo  ( 1989\u00ad90));  in Ps.-Skylax 12  Poseidonia  is  listed  as  a  polis  Hellenis  and Greek-style  coinage  persisted  (infra),  and  Lomas  ( 2000)  178 questions  whether  Poseidonia  was  in  fact  barbarianized  \"to the  extent  that  Aristoxenus  would  have  us  believe\". The  only  evidence  for  the  internal  political  life  at Poseidonia  is  the  C 5m  ekklesiasterion  (infra)  with  its  impli- cation  of  an  assembly.  A C 6l\u00ad480  bronze  olpe  from  a  tomb  in the  area  of  the  city  (Arena  ( 1996)  no. 32)  is  inscribed  with four  Greek  names,  each  of  which  is  preceded  by  two  letters ( ,  ,  bis);  \"the  letters  preceding  the  names  are  sigla identifying  the  bearers  as  members  of  some  civic  sub- division,  whether  a  phyle,  demos  or  otherwise\"  (SEG 43  855 comm.). Poseidonia  was  founded  on  an  irregular  limestone plateau,  later  bounded  by  a  circuit  wall,  running  for  4,750  m and  mainly  of  C 4l  Leukanian  and  Roman  date  (Schl\u00e4ger ( 1962);  Blum  ( 1987)).There  are,  however,  remains  of  a  Greek circuit  wall  inside  the  later  walls,  east  of  the  south  gate (Schl\u00e4ger  ( 1962)  22),  and  the  Greek  city  probably  did  have  a circuit  wall,  at  least  contemporary  with  the  building  of  the large  temples,  as  indicated  by  the  fact  that  the  north  and south  gates  were  laid  out  in  accordance  with  the  orientation of  the  temples.  The  extent  of  the  C 6\u00adC5  habitation  area,  esti- mated  at  c. 125  ha,  is  indicated  by  several  large  cemeteries  (E. Greco ( 1979)  12\u00ad13;  Pontrandolfo  ( 1987))  and  sanctuaries situated  along  the  edge  of  the  urban  area  (Greco,  Stazio  and Vallet ( 1987);  Pedley  et al.( 1993)). Although  the  orthogonal  urban  layout  with  narrow  insu- lae  and  the  use  of  plateiai  and  stenopoi  is  of  Roman  date,  it was  probably  Greek  in  origin,  as  suggested  by  the  very  simi- lar  evidence  from  Metapontion  (no. 61),  also  an  Achaian colony  (Castagnoli  ( 1956)  39\u00ad44;  Schl\u00e4ger  ( 1965)  188\u00ad97; E.  Greco  and  Theodorescu  ( 1990)  87).  The  main  divisions  of the  city  were  formed  by  a  broad  central,  civic  belt:  the  agora and  the  two  large  temene,  dividing  the  habitation  area  into two  main  zones.  The  public  space  constituted  about  25  per cent  of  the  area  inside  the  walls  (E.  Greco  and  Theodorescu ( 1994)  236).  There  is  no  certain  evidence  of  the  extent  of  the C 6  habitation,  but  it  probably  comprised  c. 70  ha  of  the urban  area.  The  political  function  of  the  agora  is  revealed  by an  ekklesiasterion  and  a  heroon.  The  C 5m\u00adC4  circular  ekkle- siasterion  had  a  seating  capacity  of 1,000\u00ad1,700  (E.  Greco and  Theodorescu  ( 1983)  34\u00ad49,  79\u00ad81;  Hansen  and  Fischer- Hansen  ( 1994)  69\u00ad72).  A  heroon,  or  cenotaph,  has  been recognised  in  the  sunken  limestone  chamber  containing rich  grave  goods  and  in  C 4  surrounded  by  a  peribolos  wall (Sestieri  ( 1955a);  E.  Greco  and  Theodorescu  ( 1983)  25\u00ad33, 74\u00ad79).The  location  of  the  structure  suggests  a  political  cult, possibly  that  of  the  oikistes.  The  small  ante-temple  located west  of  the  ekklesiasterion  possibly  housed  a  poliad  cult; the  altar  in  the  ekklesiasterion  lies  on  the  axis  of  this  temple, thus  suggesting  some  overall  planning  (E.  Greco  and Theodorescu  ( 1983)  65  fig. 8\"T\"). The  major  divinity  of  the  southern  temenos  was  Hera. The  main  temple  was  the  C 6m  \"Basilica\"  (Heraion  I),  a Heraion  according  to  the  epigraphic  evidence  (Guarducci ( 1952);  LSAG 252,  260  no. 3;  SEG 29  982;  Arena  ( 1996)  no. 19). Apart  from  her  warrior  aspect,  she  was  also  kourotrophos (Ardovino  ( 1986)  107,  113).  There  were other  cults  (survey  of cults:  Ardovino  ( 1986)):  Hera  Hippia:  G.  Greco  ( 1992) 254\u00ad55;  Hera  and  Zeus:  Stern  ( 1980);  but  Hera,  the  patron deity,  enthroned  and  holding  a  phiale  is  the  commonest type  of  votive.  The  second  major  temple  was  the  \"Temple  of Poseidon\"  (Heraion  II)  (c. 460\u00ad450),normally  identified as a Heraion,  though  Torelli  ( 1987)  60\u00ad62)  suggests  Apollo Hiatros  (Cipriani  ( 1997)  221\u00ad22  suggests  Zeus).  There  were several  other  structures  in  the  sanctuary  already  from  the Archaic  period,  e.g.  a  C 6l  temple  located  on  the  northern edge  of  the  temenos  (Bertarelli  Sestieri  ( 1987\u00ad88)  107\u00ad8  pl. 2). Votive  finds indicate cults of  Athena,  Aphrodite  and  Artemis in  addition  to  that  of  Hera  and  kourotrophoi,  and  a  number of  anatomical  votives  and  the  type  of  \"infant  in  swaddling clothes\"  suggest  a  healing  divinity  or  a  Meter  (Bertarelli Sestieri  ( 1989)).The  stele  (a  horos?)  of  Chiron  (C 6e)  suggests a  \"precinct  of  Chiron\"  (LSAG 252,  259  no. 2;  Arena  ( 1996)  no. 50.25).  A  precinct  of  Zeus  Xenios  is  inferred  from  a  (lost) inscription  (Cipriani  ( 1997)  223;  Arena  ( 1996)  no. 23),  and several  smaller  temples,  as  well  as  various  altars  and  votive deposits  add  to  the  furnishings  of  the  sanctuary  (Sestieri ( 1955b),  ( 1956);  Bertarelli  Sestieri  ( 1987\u00ad88);  Cipriani  ( 1997) 215\u00ad16;  cf.  also  Mertens  ( 1993)  93  n. 868:  architectural remains  from  at  least  eight  different  Archaic  roofs).  The  row 288 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo of  altars,  various  votive  deposits,  and  horoi  east  of  the  two large  temples  indicate  the  eastern  limit  of  the  sanctuary (Bertarelli  Sestieri  ( 1987\u00ad88)  94\u00ad95,114).There  is  C 6(?)  evid- ence  of  a  Demeter  sanctuary  on  the  southern  confines of  the Heraion  (Cipriani  and  Ardovino  ( 1989\u00ad90)  346  with  refs.), and  the  Demeter  cult  is  attested  in  various  locations  of Poseidonia  (Cipriani  ( 1997)  222\u00ad23;  Hinz  ( 1998)  171\u00ad76). Finally  there  are  epigraphic  attestations  of  various  cults:  of Pais,  as  an  epiclesis  of  Hera (?),  of  Athena,  Zeus  Xenios, Chiron  (if  not  a  personal  name),  and  of  the  nymphs (Ardovino  ( 1980);  Arena  ( 1996)  no. 51).  A  cult  of  Poseidon must  have  played  an  important  role  in  the  city,  as  we  can infer  from  the  city's  name  and  from  the  coin  type  depicting a  striding  Poseidon.  There  is  evidence  of  a  Herakles  cult  in the  Leukanian  period,  but  for  the  Greek  period  the  evidence is  uncertain,  though  there  are  many  references  to Herakles myths  in  the  architectural  sculptures  of  the  Heraion  del  Sele (see  Cipriani  ( 1997)  223\u00ad24,  stressing  the  polis  aspect  of Herakles  cults).  In  the  northern  sanctuary  there  is  one major  temple,  a  C 6l\u00adC5e  \"Temple  of  Demeter\"  (Krauss ( 1959)),  and  a  cult  of  Athena  is  inferred  from  votive  material (Sestieri  ( 1955b)  40).  A  C 6f  sacellum  located  to the  south  of the  major  temple  is  the  earliest  identified t emple  at Poseidonia,  known  only  from  its  architectural  terracottas (Mertens  ( 1993)  93,  127).  An  Aphrodite  shrine  was  probably situated  to  the  north  of  the  Athena  temple  (Sestieri  ( 1955b) 40),  and  a  C 6e  naiskos  lay  between  the  Athenaion  and  the agora  (Poseidonia  ii. 64).  The  cult  of  Poseidon  must  have been  important  in  the  first settlement (at A gropolis?; cf.  schol.  Lycoph.  Alex. 724)  but  is  not  attested  in  the  major settlement  except  on  the  coins  (infra).  Important  Greek cemeteries  occupied  extensive  areas  to  the  north,  south-east and  south  of  the  city  (Mello  and  Libero  Mangieri  ( 1996) 332\u00ad33,  335\u00ad37). Parmenides  of  Poseidonia  won  both  the  stadion  and  the diaulos  at  Olympia  in  468  (Olympionikai 235\u00ad36). Poseidonia  began  minting  silver  coins  c. 530\u00ad525  with issues  in  the  Achaian  incuse  fabric,  although  the  weight  system  used  was  the  \"Phocaean\u00adPhoenician\"  standard,  as  at Hyele  (see  Taliercio  Mensitieri  ( 1987)).  Drachms,  obols  and hemiobols  were  struck  in  addition  to  staters  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3 1107ff).  The  type  depicts  a  striding  Poseidon,  a  trident  in  his  raised  right  hand; legends: ,  , (Gorini (1975)30 \u00ad 32;Rutter,HN  \u00b3  1107;  SNG Cop.  Italy 1271\u00ad76,  1294\u00ad96).  Some  coins  carry  the  additional legend ,  the  meaning  of  which  is  disputed  (Rutter, HN \u00b3  ad 1108).  The  suggestion  that  it  refers  to  Is,  oecist  of Sybaris,  has  won  some  acceptance  (Guarducci,  EG  ii. 661), though  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  the  legend  refers  to  an unknown  locality  implying  some  sort  of  league  membership (Gorini  ( 1975)  208).  The  minting  of  incuse  staters  stopped c. 510\u00ad500,  perhaps  as  a  result  of  the  destruction  of  Sybaris, and  until  c. 470  the  city  struck  only  minor  denominations (Rutter  ( 1997)  57).  C. 470  Poseidonia  introduced  a  double- relief  coinage  employing  the  Achaian  weight  standard,  possi- bly  influenced b y  refugees  from  Sybaris  (no. 70.II)  (Kraay ( 1967)  133;  Rutter  ( 1997)  42).  Types  depict  obv.  Poseidon striding;  rev.  bull  standing;  legend: ,  , ,,  (Rutter, HN \u00b3  1114;  SNG  Cop. Italy 1277\u00ad93,  1297\u00ad1308). Denominations  included  staters,  drachms,  diobols,  obols, hemiobols  and  possibly  octobols  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  1116ff).  The additional  legend  on one issue may refer to the  river Seilaros/Silaris  (?)  or,  perhaps  more  plausibly,  may  read ,  a  name  and  a  possible  reference  to  an  otherwise undocumented  oikistes  (Guarducci,  EG  ii. 698\u00ad99;Rutter, HN \u00b3  1114).Bronze  coinage  with  types  of  the  double-relief  sil- ver  coinage  and  continued  use  of  the  city-ethnic  for  the  leg- end  ( ,  ,  ) starts c. 420  (Grunauer  ( 1973)  38;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  1151ff;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1309\u00ad23).  To  the  later  C 5  belongs  a  gold  triobol  inscribed (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  1115).  The  Leukanian  conquest  did  not mean  the  end  of  the  coinage  (Rutter  ( 1997)  76\u00ad77). 67. ", "Herakleia": "Identifier: 53. , (Herakleios) Map  45.Lat.40.15,long.16.40.

The  city  may  initially  have  been called  by  another  name  (Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 11),  but the  only  known  toponym  is  `, (Antiochos (FGrHist)  fr. 11  apud  Strabo  6.1.14;  IG xiv  645.ii.2  (C 4l));  or `  (IG xiv  645  ii.32  (C 4l));  Ps.-Skylax  14  has ` .  The  city-ethnic  is  `  (C 4  coins, infra;  IG xiv  645.i.11  (C 4l)),  also  spelled  `  (C 4 coins,  infra).  Only  after  the  Classical  period  does `  appear  (BE  ( 1964)  no. 247  (C 1);  Diod. 13.3.4 (r 415);  Strabo  6.1.14),  but  `  is  none  the  less  often qualified b y  ' '  to  distinguish  it  from  the  ethnics of  other  cities  of  the  same  name  (CID ii  6.B.2  (c. 358);  BCH 23 ( 1899)  501  nos. 16\u00ad17  (both  C 4)). Herakleia  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  IG xiv 645.i.64  (C 4l)  and  implicitly  at  Ps.-Skylax  14,where Herakleion  is  the  first t oponym  listed  after  the  heading     (cf.  Diod. 12.36.4  (r 433/2));  it  is  called  a polis  in  the  political  sense  at  IG xiv  645.i.2,  i.95  (C 4l),  etc. Damos  is  found  at  IG xiv  645.i.119  (C 4l).The  internal  collec- tive  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  on  C 4  coins  (infra)  and  at IG xiv  645.i.11  (C 4l);  the  external  collective  use  is  found  in CID ii  6.B.2  (c. 358)  and  Diod. 13.3.4  (r 415);  the  external  indi- vidual  use  is  found  in  BCH 23  ( 1899)  501\u00ad2  nos. 16\u00ad17  (C 4) and  BCH 63  ( 1939\u00ad41)  150  (C 4).  Patris  is  found  in  Anthologia Lyrica  Graeca 1  p. 11,  Diehl. Herakleia  was  a  joint  foundation  of  Taras  (no. 71)  and Thourioi  (no. 74):  after  a  war  for  influence in the S iritis (Antiochos  (FGrHist)  fr. 11;  cf.  IvO 254\u00ad56  (c. 440)  and  Diod. 12.23.2  (r 444))  these  two  cities  made  an  agreement  to  found  a joint  colony  (Antiochos  loc.  cit. Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 158). According  to Antiochos  (loc.  cit.),  however,  the  city  was founded  in  the  name  of  Taras  (    ),and confirmation of  Tarantine  predominance may  be  seen  in  the  fact  that  Herakleia's  eponymous  official was  an  ephor  (IG xiv  645.i.1  (C 4l);  SEG 30  1162\u00ad70  (C 4l\u00adC3e); cf.  also  IG xiv  645.i.146  (C 4l)  for  the  term laws). Diod. 12.36.4  dates  the  foundation  to  433/2  and  treats  it  as  a purely  Tarantine  enterprise  (as  does  Strabo  6.1.14;  cf. 6.3.4 (r 330s),  where  Herakleia  is  described  as  \"in  Tarantine  territ- ory\"  and  a  war  between  Taras  and  the  Messapians   `is mentioned).According to Diodorus (loc.cit.), the  city  was  founded  at  the  site  of  Siris  (no. 69),  whose  inhab- itants  were  deported.  According  to  Antiochos  (FGrHist 555) fr. 11,\"Herakleia\"was  not  the  original  name:  the  city  was  thus named  only  after  having  changed  its  location  ( ` '    ,  \u00b5  \u00b5   ),  and  a  combination  of  Diodorus  and  Antiochos would  suggest  that  the  city  was  originally  founded  as  Siris  at the  site  of  Siris,  but  later  relocated  and  then  named  Herakleia. Such  a  reconstruction  is  not,  however,  supported  by  the archaeological  evidence,  which  clearly  shows  Herakleia  to have  occupied  the  site  of  Siris  (infra).  According  to  Strabo 6.1.14,  Siris  served  as  the  epineion  of  Herakleia,  but  the  refer- ence  is  not  to  the  historical  Siris  but  to  the  legendary  polis Tro\u00efke  of  the  same  name. In  the  chora,  traces  of  land  division  have  been  examined by  Guy  ( 1995).  Sacred  land  belonging  to  Dionysos  and Athena  Polias  is  attested  by  IG xvi  645.i,  ii  (C 4l)  respective- ly.  These  Tabulae  Heracleenses  (C 4l)  deal  with  the  recovery and  the  measuring  of  the  fields belonging t o  the  two  divini- ties,  probably  from  the  time  of  the  foundation  in  433/2 (Sartori ( 1967)  37\u00ad76).  To  the  north  along  the  river  Cavone (ancient  Akalandros)  the  territory of  Herakleia  bordered upon  Metapontine  territory,  the  western  border  being  con- stituted  by  the  natural  strongpoint  of  the  hills  of  Anglona with  the  settlement  of  Santa  Maria  d'Anglona.  This  orig- inally  indigenous  site  with  a  history  of  C 7\u00adC6  Hellenisation (see  Siris  (no. 69))  has  revealed  sporadic  C 5l  settlement remains  and  a  C 4  sanctuary  of  Demeter  and  Artemis (R\u00fcdiger  ( 1969);  Osanna  ( 1992)  98,  109\u00ad10  no. 10).  A  city  (polis)  of  Pandosia  is  mentioned  by Plut.  Pyrrh. 16.5  in connection  with  Pyrrhos'  encampment  near  Herakleia  in 280  and  at  IG xiv  645.12,  54,  64,  etc.).  This  Pandosia  is  now commonly  identified w ith  the  settlement  of  Anglona (Sartori  ( 1967)  28  n. 52,  95;E.  Greco ( 1992b)  34,  37;  Barr. 45). Other  C 5\u00adC4  sanctuaries  are  known  in  the  chora  (Bini ( 1989);  Osanna  ( 1992)  97\u00ad105).  Farmsteads  seem  to  have been  concentrated  mainly  along  the  valley  of  the  river  Sinni (ancient  Siris)  and  to  a  lesser  degree  in  the  valley  of  the  river Agri.  In  C 4e  a  line  of  border  fortifications was laid out along south-western  hills  bordering  upon  Leukanian  territory. Harbour  settlements  near  the  estuary  of  the  river  Sinni  are inferred  from  cemeteries.  To the  south  the  territory of Herakleia  was  delimited  by  rural  sites  in  the  valley  of  the Torrente  S.  Nicola.  In  total  the  territory  comprised  about  350 km \u00b2  (overall  view:  Osanna  ( 1992)  97\u00ad114). Herakleia  was  a  member  of  the  Italiote  League (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 230),  and  in  C 4  the  city  became  the  seat  of italia  and  kampania  259 the  League,  which  had  previously  been  centred  on  Kroton (no. 56;Polyb.  2.39.5\u00ad6).  Alexander  the  Molossian  trans- ferred  the  seat  to  Thourioi  (no. 74)  (Strabo  6.3.4);  he  also reconquered  the  city  from  the  Leukanians,  who  must  then have  taken  it  (Livy  8.24.4  (r 326)). Several  citizens  of  Herakleia  were  appointed  proxenoi  by Delphi  (no. 177)  in  C 4:  BCH 23  ( 1899)  501  no. 16,  502  no. 17, and  BCH 63  ( 1939\u00ad41)  150;  the  latter  two  were  appointed  the- orodokoi  as  well. A  system  of  civic  subdivisions,  involving  two  different kinds  of  groupings,  is  attested  for  C 4l  by  IG xiv  645;  see  fur- ther  Jones,  POAG 162\u00ad64  with  refs.  A  tyranny  at  Herakleia  is mentioned  by  Phainias  fr. 16,  Wehrli,  but  its  historicity  is doubtful  since  the  story  associated  with  it  is  located  in Metapontion  (no. 61)  by  other  sources  (Berve  ( 1967) 610\u00ad11). IG xiv  645.i.49\u00ad50  (C 4l)  refers  to  legal  proceedings  initiat- ed  by  the  against  private  citizens  who  had encroached  upon  sacred  land.  The  inscription  (e.g.  at  i.55) distinguishes  between  h and land.  The  following officials are attested:  an  eponymous  ephoros  (IG xiv  645.i.1 (C 4l);  SEG 30  1162\u00ad70  (C 4l\u00adC3e));  an  annual  board  of  two \u00b5  (IG xiv  645.i.96\u00ad97,  i.104,  i.164\u00ad65  (C 4l));  an annual  board  of in charge of  a  public  granary  (IG xiv  645.i.102  (C 4l));  two  boards  of (IG xiv  645.i.2 (C 4l))  presumably  elected  (h :  IG xiv  645.i.9 (C 4l))  ad  hoc;a grammateus  (IG xiv  645.i.188  (C 4l)).  The assembly ,  is  mentioned  at  IG xiv  645.i.12,  ii.9\u00ad10 (C 4l),  and  qualified as  \"specially  summoned\" (Sartori  ( 1953)  96;  Ghinatti  ( 1996)  87).  The  work  carried  out by  the and  recorded  by  IG xiv  645  (C 4l)  was  decreed by  the  katakletos  alia  ( i.12).  Two  month  names  ( , \u00b5) are attested by IG  xiv  645.i.2,  101  (C 4l).  The  ono- mastics  of  IG xiv  645  indicate  that  non-Greeks  had  been absorbed  into  the  citizenry  (Lomas  ( 2000)  178\u00ad79). The  city  was  situated  on  the  low  and  narrow  east\u00adwest- oriented  plateau  (modern  Policoro),  between  the  estuaries of  the  rivers  Akiris  and  Siris,  the  site  of  the  C 8  foundation  of Siris  (no. 69).  The  evidence  suggests  some  measure  of  occu- pation  of  the  Policoro  plateau  from  the  Siris  phase  to  the  C 5s foundation  of  Herakleia  (H\u00e4nsel  ( 1973)  491;  Adamesteanu ( 1985a)  63). Herakleia  occupied  two  main  areas  of  habitation:  an upper  city  and  a  lower  plateau  to  the  south,  divided  from  the upper  city  by  a  depression  occupied  already  from  the Archaic  period  by  sanctuaries.  A  C 5  ashlar  circuit  wall  has been  revealed  on  the  south  and  south-east  side  of  the \"acropolis\",  on  the  northern  side  of  the  plateau,  and  sporad- ically  along  its  southern  side,  implying  a  primary  habitation of  the  plateau.A  subsequent  phase  comprising  the  lower  city was  previously  seen  as  a  result  of  the  growing  importance  of Herakleia  in  C 4e  as  head  of  the  Italiote  League (Adamesteanu  ( 1985b)  98).  Recently  an  overall,  contempo- rary 433/2  occupation  of  the  whole  site  has  been  argued, comprising  an  urban  area  of  c. 140  ha  (Giardino  ( 1998) 192\u00ad93).  Habitation  on  the  central  part  of  the  upper  plateau was  laid  out  on  both  sides  of  the  east\u00adwest  plateia  which crossed  the  middle  of  the  plateau.  The  area  has  been  inter- preted  as  a  kerameikos  with  workshops  inserted  into  the domestic  structures,  and  in  use  from  C 5  to  early  third  cen- tury ad.  The  interpretation  of  the  urban  layout  of  the  lower city  is  based  upon  aerial  photography;  this  has  revealed  a plan  of  at  least  eight  plateiai;  although  the  orientation  is generally  east\u00adwest,  it  is  different  from  that  of  the  upper  city. The  lower  city  is  protected  on  its  southern,  eastern  and  west- ern  sides  by C 4\u00adC3  ashlar  circuit  walls,  strengthened  with towers  and  an  outer  ditch.  The  slope  and  valley  between  the upper  and  lower  plateau  were  reserved  for  sanctuaries  and areas  of  public  use,  such  as  the  agora,  lying  outside  the  urban plans  of  the  upper  and  lower  city  (Neutsch  ( 1967)  110\u00ad50; H\u00e4nsel  ( 1973);  Adamesteanu  ( 1985b);  Giardini  ( 1992), ( 1998)).  Cult  had  continued  uninterrupted  in  the  sanctuary of  Demeter  from  the  Siris  phase  through  C 5  to C 4,  when structures  were  laid  out  on  a  system  of  terraces,  an  architec- tural  sophistication  reflecting the status of  Herakleia  as  head of  the  Italiote  League  (Pianu  ( 1989);  for  the  cult:  Neutsch ( 1967)  134\u00ad36,(1980)  158\u00ad65;  Sartori  ( 1980);  Hinz  ( 1998) 187\u00ad93).  The  sanctuary  housed  also  the  cults  of  Artemis Soteira  (Neutsch  ( 1967)  134),  and  Artemis  Bendis  was  vener- ated  in  her  role  as  divinity  of  asylia  (Pianu  ( 1989)  108;Curti ( 1989)  28\u00ad29).  Other  votive  material  indicates  a  cult  of Athena,  attested  also  by  the  coin  types  (infra);  Athena  Polias is  attested  at  IG xiv  645.ii.5  (C 4l).The  central  area  of  the  val- ley  was  occupied  by  the  sanctuary  of  the  \"Archaic  Temple\",  of uncertain  cult,  which  was  enlarged  in  C 5\u00adC3  to comprise various  religious  buildings,  treasuries,  a  hestiaterion(?),  as well  as  a  vast  public  space  interpreted  as  the  agora  (Pianu ( 1991)).The  sacred  lands  of  Athena  and  Dionysos  attested  by the  Tabulae  probably  occupied  the  area  north  of  the  city, since  this  area  has  been  shown  to  have  been  unoccupied. The  cemeteries  were  located  to  the  east,  south  and  west  of the  city;  rites  were  mainly  inhumation  in  cist-slab  tombs, and  some  graves  are  rich  in  tomb  gifts  reflecting the city's ceramic  production  (Degrassi  ( 1967);  Da  Leukania  a Lucania 151\u00ad97).  Cults  of  Hestia  and  Aphrodite  are  attested by IG xiv  646  (C 4\u00adC3). 260 fischer-hansen,  nielsen  and  ampolo Herakleia  minted  silver  coins  from  the  time  of  its  founda- tion  on  the  Achaian\u00adThourian  standard,  but  with  the Tarantine  system  of  denominations  (Van  Keuren  ( 1994)). The  first series,  c. 432\u00ad420,  were  diobols:  obv.  head  of Herakles,  or  Athena  in  Attic  helmet;  rev.  lion,  legend   (SNG  Cop.  Italy 1098\u00ad1100),  or  Herakles  strangling  lion, legend: ,  h ,  h (Van Keuren ( 1994)  nos. 23\u00ad40;Rutter,HN\u00b31358\u00ad60).Staters  were issued  c. 430\u00ad400(?):  obv.  head  of  Athena,  helmet  decorated with  olive  wreath;  rev.  Herakles  seated  on  a  rock  pouring  a libation,  legend  ,  sometimes  retrograde (Van  Keuren  ( 1994)  no. 1;Rutter,  HN \u00b3  1362).  Later  series  of staters  and  diobols  c. 420\u00adC4l  have types:  obv.  head  of Athena  wearing  Attic  helmet,  decorated  with  hippocamp  or Skylla,  on  one  die  the  legend  ;  rev.  Herakles standing  or  kneeling,  fighting the N emean  lion  (Rutter,  HN \u00b3 1363ff;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1101\u00ad4,  1115\u00ad32).  The  dies  of  some issues  are  signed  ,  a  die-engraver  also known from  Metapontion  (Rutter,  HN \u00b31373).  From  c. 334  a new  issue  of  diobols  and  staters,  possibly  related  to Alexander  the  Molossian  (Van  Keuren  ( 1994)  28\u00ad29,  32), have  rev.  Herakles  standing,  holding  club  and  lion  skin (Rutter,  HN \u00b31381,  1383;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1105\u00ad14).  The  types with  Herakles  are  obviously  connected  with  his  cult  in  a  city named  after  him,  and  on  the  reverse  of  the  early  staters  he may  be  pouring  a  libation  in  the  role  of  oikistes  (Rutter ( 1997)  47).  A  single  issue  of  gold  (quarter-stater)  of  C 3e  has been  attributed  to  Herakleia  (Van  Keuren  ( 1994)  no. 124; Rutter,  HN \u00b31421);  bronze  coinage  was  introduced  in  C 4 (Rutter,  HN \u00b3  1436ff;  SNG  Cop.  Italy 1133\u00ad43).Herakleian  and Tarantine  C 4l\u00adC3  silver  fractions  have  similar  types  and suggest  federal  production. A  communal  donation  towards  the  rebuilding  of  the Delphic  temple  is  recorded  by  CID ii  6.B.2  (c. 358). 53. "}, "Propontic Thrace": {"Selymbria": "Identifier: 681. , became  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  in  the tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.16)  to  418/17  (IG i\u00b3 287.ii.17)  a  total  of  sixteen  times,  twice  completely  but  con- vincingly  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 9  tal.  in  454/3 (IG i\u00b3  259.ii.16),  6  tal.  from  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.iv.8)  to  447/6 (IG i\u00b3  265.i.57),5  tal.  from  443/2  (IG i\u00b3  269.ii.9)  to  439/8  (IG i\u00b3 273.ii.23),  900  dr.  from  435/4  (IG i\u00b3  277.v.12)  to  432/1  (IG i\u00b3 280.ii.33)  and  9  tal.  again  in  430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.iii.19).  The reduction to 900  drachmas  was  presumably  connected  with the  growing  pressure  of  the  Odrysians  (ATL  iii. 310\u00ad12). Selymbria  joined  the  revolt  of  Perinthos  (no. 678)  by  410,and members  of  the  pro-Athenian  faction  were  exiled (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 207.12  IG i\u00b3  118;  cf.  Gehrke,  Stasis 145\u00ad46); the  city  refused  to  admit  Alkibiades,  but  paid  him  money (Xen.  Hell. 1.1.21).  Selymbria  was  recaptured  by  Alkibiades  in 408;  the  city  was  torn  by  stasis,  and  its  fortifications betrayed to  Alkibiades  by  the  pro-Athenian  faction;  it  was  forced  to pay  indemnity,  to  accept  an  Athenian  garrison  (Plut.  Alc. 30.2\u00ad5;Xen.  Hell. 1.3.10;Diod.  13.66.4;Gehrke,  Stasis 145\u00ad46), and  probably  also  to  give  hostages.  The  ensuing  settlement  in 408  (IG i\u00b3  118;ML  87)  mentions  guarantees  (ll. 1\u00ad31)  of Selymbrian  autonomy,  restoration  of  hostages  and  political refugees  (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 207.12),  cancellation  of  Athenian and  allied  claims  to  property  lost  in  Selymbria  except  for  real property (presumably  indicating  the  existence  of  Athenian and  allied  landownership  in  Selymbria).  The  settlement  was ratified in  407  by  the  Athenian  ekklesia  on  the  motion  of Alkibiades  (ll. 31\u00ad47).  A  member  of  the  Second  Athenian Naval  League  since  377  (IG ii\u00b2  43B.29),  Selymbria  joined  the revolt  of  Byzantion  in  357  (Dem. 15.26).  According  to  the decree  quoted  at  Dem. 18.77,  Selymbria  was  besieged  by Philip  in  340.  The  decree  is  spurious,  but  the  information  it contains  may  be  correct,  and,  like  Perinthos  and  Byzantion, Selymbria  must  have  been  besieged  by  Philip  II  in  340. The  civic  institutions  of  Selymbria  are  unattested,  except for  the  probable  mention  of  aisimnatai  in  a  C 4  inscription (SGDI 3068:[ ] \u00b5[];  cf.  Hanell  ( 1934)  149)  but  are believed  to  have  reproduced  the  pattern  better  known  for other  colonies  of  Megarian  origin  (Hanell  ( 1934)  132ff;  cf. Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  142\u00ad47).  Arist.  Oec. 1348b  mentions  a law  forbidding  the  export  of  corn in  times  of  shortage. Apollo  (Pythios),  probably  to  be  restored  in  line  28  of  the agreement  between  Athens  and  Selymbria  of 407,  seems  to have  been  the  protective  deity  of  Selymbria,  with  public documents  being  published  in  his  sanctuary  (IG i\u00b3 118.26\u00ad28;  cf.  Hanell  ( 1934)  166;  Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  104\u00ad5 with  reference  to BCH 36  ( 1912)  558,  pace  ML 87). Selymbria  issued  two  series  of  silver  coins:  (a)  from  492/0 to 473/0  and  (b)  from  425/0  to 411/10,  presumably  on  the Thrako-Makedonian  standard  and  apparently  for  local  use.

Byz. 642.18)  or  (Aeschin. 3.82;Dem.  7.37)  or     (Dem. 9.15; Harp. 4).  The  city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3 283.ii.19).  Serrion  Teichos  is  not  called  a  polis  in  any  source, but  polis  status  is  indicated  by  its  membership  of  the  Delian League.  The  collective  and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  in  the  tribute  lists  (infra)  and  is  restored  in  the assessment  decree  of 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.104). The  identification of  Serrion  Teichos  with  Ganos  (ATL  i. 545;  Kahrstedt  ( 1954)  21  followed  by  Barr.)  is  unconvincing (Isaac  ( 1986)  211)  and  contradicted  by  the  explicit  distinc- tion  between  the  two  sites  in  Aeschin. 3.82  followed  by  Harp. 3  and 4;  see  Ganos,  supra 913.  Propontic  Serrion  Teichos is  clearly  to  be  distinguished  from  Serrion  on  the  Aegean coast  of  Thrace  (supra 872). Serrion  Teichos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  in  the tribute  lists  of 428/7  (IG i\u00b3  283.ii.19),  421/0  (IG i\u00b3  285.ii.87) and 418/17  (IG i\u00b3  287.ii.18),  contributing  unknown  sums.  It was  one  of  the  fortresses  conquered  by  Philip  II  in  346 (Aeschin. 3.82;Dem.  7.37,  9.15). 681. ", "Byzantion": "Identifier: 677. , (Byzantios) Map  52.  Lat. 41.00,long. 28.55.

The  city-ethnic  is   (SEG 32  412.7\u00ad8  (C 5e);  IG vii  2418.9  (C 4m);  Xen.  Hell. 1.3.19; Dem. 15.3).Byzantion  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense (Hdt. 4.87.2;Xen.  Hell. 1.3.17\u00ad19;  An. 7.1.17\u00ad19;Dem.  18.87; Archestratos  fr. 39.8,  Olson  and  Sens)  and  in  the  political sense  (Hdt. 5.103.2;Xen.  An. 7.1.27;Dem.  8.15;  IByz. 4.3 (C 4l)  IvO 45  and 9.3  (C 4)).  Polites  and  astos  are  used  syn- onymously  at  Arist.  Oec. 1346a27\u00ad29.  The  collective use  of the  city-ethnic  (abbreviated  as  BY)  is  found  internally  on C 5l\u00adC4  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  inscriptions  (IG i\u00b3 1144.118  (C 5f);  IG ii\u00b2  43.83  ( 378/7))  and  in  literature  (Xen. Hell. 1.3.16;Isoc.  14.28;Dem.  15.3;  Arist.  Pol. 1303a33).  The individual  and  external  use  of  the  ethnic  is  attested  in inscriptions  (SEG 32.412,  Olympia  (C 5f);  SEG 18.180,Delphi (C 4s);  IG ii\u00b2  8434\u00ad35,  Athens  (C 4))  and  in  literature  (Hdt. 4.138.1;Dem.  20.61). The  city  of  Byzantion  occupied  the  head  of  the  promon- tory  between  the  Golden  Horn,  the  Bosporos  and  the Propontis.  Its  favourable  geographical  position  from  both  a military  and  an  economic  point  of  view  is  frequently  noted in  our  sources  and  contrasted  with  the  less  favourable  posi- tion  of  Kalchedon  (no. 743)  (Hdt. 4.144.2;Polyb.  4.38.1; Strabo  7.6.2;  Dio  Cass. 75.10.1).Except  from  the  west,  the  city was  protected  by  the  sea  and,  to  the  south-east,  by  a  precipi- tous  shoreline.  A  particular  conjunction  of  currents  and winds  forced  all  ships  coming  from  the  Black  Sea  to  sail  close to  the  fortifications of  Byzantion,  which  meant  that  the  city could  control  all  navigation  from  the  north  through  the Bosporos  (Polyb. 4.44.3\u00ad11).  For  the  same  reason,  large shoals  of  spawning  mackerel  and  tuna  migrated  from  the Black  Sea  to  the  Mediterranean  Sea  near  the  west  shore  of the  Bosporos  and  provided  the  Byzantians  with  great  quan- tities  of  easily  obtainable  food  (Archestratos  fr. 38;  Arist.  Pol. 1291b23). The  territory  of  Byzantion  comprised  the  eastern  part  of the  Thracian  peninsula  between  the  Black  Sea  to  the  north, the  Bosporos  to  the  east  and  the  Propontis  to  the  south.  It covered an area of  some  1,500  km \u00b2.  The  western  frontier stretched  overland  from  a  point  west  of  the  Derkos  (Delkos) Sea  in  the  north  to  the  river  Athyras  (Kara  Su),  and  then along  it  to  the  Athyras  (B\u00fcy\u00fckcekme\u00e7e)  Sea  in  the  south (Strabo  7  fr. 56;  Plin.  HN 4.46;Pompon.  2.24).  It encom- passed  to  the  north  a  locality  called  Phileas  or  Philia  situat- ed  on  a  promontory  of  the  same  name  stretching  into  the Black  Sea  (Ps.-Skymnos  722\u00ad23).  To  the  north,  Byzantion bordered  on  the  domain  of  Thracian  dynasts  (Polyb. 4.45.1). To  the  south  Byzantion  bordered  on  Selymbria  (no. 679) (Dem. 15.26).  On  the  other  hand,  the  possession  of  the  sanctuary  of  Zeus  Ourios  on  the  east  side  of  the  Bosporos opposite  the  entrance  to  the  Black  Sea  was  a  bone  of  con- tention  between  Byzantion  and  Kalchedon  (Diod. 20.111.3 (r 302);  Polyb. 4.50.3). According  to  some  sources,  Byzantion  was  a  colony  of Megara (no. 225)  (Ps.-Skymnos  717;  Philostr.  VS 24).  Vell. Pat. 2.7.7,  however,  lists  Byzantion  along  with  Kyzikos  (no. 747)  as  foundations  of  Miletos  (no. 854).  Late  authors  of local  history  as  a  rule  point  to  Megara  as  the  founder  of Byzantion,  but  they  also  mention  Sparta  (no. 345),  Argos (no. 347),  Corinth  (no. 227),  Mykenai  (no. 353),  Karystos (no. 373),Boiotia  and  Athens  (no. 361)  (Dion.  Byzant.  Anapl. Bosp.,  passim;  Lydus,  Mag. 3.70;  Hsch.  Patria 3\u00ad5;  Const. Porphyr.  De  them. ii  p. 46,  Bonn).  Probably,  the  majority  of colonists  came  from  Megara,  while  some  contingents  were supplied  by  their  immediate  neighbours,  especially  Argos, Corinth  and  Boiotia.  Such  a  scenario  is  confirmed b y Aristotle's  report  of  a  stasis  between  the  original  colonists and  a  later  contingent  of  different  stock,  resulting  in  the expulsion  of  the  newcomers  (Pol. 1303a25,  32\u00ad33).  The  propontic  thrace  915 incident  is  probably  to  be  dated  to  the  Archaic  period (Gehrke,  Stasis 34).  The  Megarian  majority  came  to  domi- nate  Byzantion,  as  attested  by  its  Doric  dialect,  its  cults,  its  onomastics  and  its  institutions  (division  of  the  civic  body into  hekatostyes  and  a  hieromnamon  as  the  eponymous  official). According  to  a  well-known  anecdote  (Hdt. 4.144.2), Byzantion  was  founded  seventeen  years  after  Kalchedon.  As the  foundation  year  Euseb.  Chron.  versus  Arm.  records Olymp. 30.1  660/59  (Schoene  ii  86),  and  the  Hieronymus adaptation  Olymp. 30.2  659/8  ( 94b,  Helm)  or,  in  another manuscript,  Olymp. 30.3  658/7  (Schoene  ii  87).  The  year of  the  foundation  of  Kalchedon  as  indicated  by  the Hieronymus  adaptation  is  Olymp. 23.4  685/4  ( 93b,Helm). The  difference  between  the  sources  amounts  to  only  nine years,  and  we  may  assume  that  the  foundation  of  Byzantion took  place  around  660.  From  the  foundation  onwards  the Byzantians  were  involved  in  constant  warfare  with  neigh- bouring  Thracian  tribes  (Polyb. 4.45.1;Diod.  14.12.2  (r 403)). Byzantion  joined  the  Ionian  Revolt  in  499\u00ad494  and,  after its  suppression  by  Persia,  the  Byzantians  and  the Kalchedonians  fled t o  the  Pontic  region  and  settled  down  in Mesambria  (no. 687)  (Hdt. 6.33.2),  reinforcing  the  original contingent  of  colonists  from  Megara  and  Kalchedon  (infra 935). Byzantion  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League,  and  was probably  among  the  original  members  (ATL  iii. 206).  In  the early  years  of  the  Delian  League  Byzantion  supplied  ships rather  than  paying  tribute.  Thus,  an  Athenian  casualty  list  of c. 465  records  names  of  Byzantians  killed  in  a  naval  battle near  Sigeion  (IG i\u00b3  1144.118\u00ad28).  Byzantion  belonged  to the Hellespontine  district  (IG i\u00b3  269.ii.26)  and  is  registered  in the  tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.7)  to  428/7  (IG i\u00b3 283.39,  completely  but  plausibly  restored)  a  total  of  fourteen times,  three  times  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 15 tal.  in  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.v.16),  surpassed  only  by  the  30  tal. paid  by  Aigina  (no. 358).  The  tribute  was  raised  to  15  tal., 4,300  dr.  in  443/2  (IG i\u00b3  269.ii.26)  and  to  18  tal. 1,800  dr.  in 433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.32).In  430/29  Byzantion  paid  a  phoros  of 21 tal.  and  3,420  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  281.iii.18)  in  addition  to  855  dr.  for special  measures  taken  by  Athens  in  the  Hellespontine  and Bosporos  regions  (IG i\u00b3  281.iii.49).  Byzantion  was  possibly assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.175,  completely restored).  Byzantion  revolted  in  441/0,  supporting  Samos (no. 864)  in  her  conflict w ith  Athens  (Thuc. 1.115.5),  but  was recovered  in  spring  or  early  summer  439  after  the  subjuga- tion  of  Samos  (Thuc. 1.117.3).  Byzantion  defected  from  the League  once  again  in  411  after  the  Sicilian  disaster  (Thuc. 8.80.3;  cf.  Diod. 13.34.2).A  Spartan  garrison  under  a  harmost was  placed  in  the  city  (Xen.  Hell. 1.3.15),but  it  was  expelled  in 408  when  the  city  was  betrayed  to  the  Athenians  under Alkibiades  (Xen.  Hell. 1.3.20\u00ad22;  cf.  Losada  ( 1972)  22). Thereafter  Byzantion  remained  loyal  to  Athens  until  after the  battle  of  Aigos  potamoi  (Xen.  Hell. 2.2.1). In C 4e  Byzantion  formed  an  alliance  together  with Kyzikos  (no. 747),  Ephesos  (no. 844),  Samos  (no. 864),  Iasos (no. 891),  Knidos  (no. 903),  Rhodos  (no. 1000)  and  possibly Lampsakos  (no. 748),  Thebes  (no. 221),  Kroton  (no. 56)  and Zakynthos  (no. 141).  This  alliance  is  known  only  through  a series  of  silver  coins  weighing  c. 11  g  (tridrachm  of  Rhodian standard  or  didrachm  of  Aiginetan  standard),  and  all  with the  same  obv.  type:  infant  Herakles  strangling  snakes  and the  legend  (\u00b5);  on  the  rev.  each  of  the  allied  cities placed  its  emblem,  i.e.  in  the  case  of  Byzantion  a  bull  above  a dolphin.  The  purpose  of  the  alliance  was  to  oppose  Sparta (no. 345),  and  it  was  formed  either  in  394  after  the  battle  of Knidos  or  in  387/6  after  the  King's  Peace  (Karwiese  ( 1980); Sch\u00f6nert-Geiss  ( 1970)  31\u00ad35). Alongside  Chios  (no. 840),  Rhodos  (no. 1000)  and Mytilene  (no. 798),  Byzantion  was  a  founding  member  of the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League.  A  separate  treaty between  Athens  and  Byzantion  was  concluded  in  the autumn  of 378  (IG ii\u00b2  41  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 256),  and Byzantion  is  listed  among  the  allies  in  the  so-called  Charter of  the  League  (IG ii\u00b2  43.83  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 257).At  the  insti- gation  of  Epameinondas,  Byzantion  may  briefly have left the League  in  364  (Diod. 15.79.1;Isoc.5.53;  but  see  Buckler  ( 1980) 170\u00ad72;  Hornblower  ( 1982)  200).  If  so,  it  rejoined  the  League (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 305)  until--in c ollusion  with  Mausolos (Dem. 15.3;  Hornblower  ( 1982)  209)--Byzantion,  Chios, Rhodos  and  Kos  (no. 497)  revolted  against  Athens  in  357  and started  the  so-called  Social  War  (Dem. 15.3;Diod.  16.7.3\u00ad4). When  peace  was  concluded  in  355,  Athens  had  to accept Byzantion's  secession  from  the  League  (Isoc. 8.16,  15.63\u00ad64; Diod. 16.22.2;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 313). In 352/1  or  later,  a treaty  was  concluded  between Byzantion  and  Philip  of  Makedon  (Dem. 9.34,  11.3,  18.87  and 93;  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 318),  but  when  in  340  Philip  attacked  and besieged  Byzantion  a  new  treaty  with  Athens  was  concluded (Dem. 18.87\u00ad89). Byzantine  envoys  are  attested  in  378/7  in  connection  with the  treaty  with  Athens  (IG ii\u00b2  41)  and  in  355  in  connection with  Byzantion's  financial c ontribution  to  Thebes  (no. 221) during  the  Third  Sacred  War  (IG vii  2418.12).  Demosthenes served  as  envoy  to  Byzantion  in  341  (Dem. 18.244;  Aeschin. 3.256).  From  the  Classical  period,  only  one  grant  of  proxeny 916 loukopoulou  and  laitar is  attested:  viz.  to  the  Spartan  harmost  Klearchos  in  409/8 (Xen.  Hell. 1.1.35).  Citizens  of  Byzantion  received  proxeny from  Athens  (Dem. 20.60\u00ad63  (after  389);  IG ii\u00b2  76  (before 378/7);  IG ii\u00b2  235  ( 340/39)),  from  Thebes  (IG vii  2408 ( 364/3));  from  Kos  (no. 497)  (ICos  ED 40.5  (C 4))  and  from Olbia  (no. 690)  (IGDOP 18  ( 340\u00ad330)). The  original  constitution  of  Byzantion  is  unknown.  In the  time  of  Dareios'  campaign  to  Skythia  the  city  was  ruled by  a  tyrant  (Hdt. 4.138.1).  It  is  often  assumed  that  Byzantion became  a  democracy  when  it  joined  the  Delian  League (Gehrke,  Stasis 35)  but  we  have  no  information.  In  the  peri- od 411\u00ad408  Sparta  had  a  harmost  and  a  garrison  in  the  city (Xen.  Hell. 1.3.15,  20\u00ad22).  In  408  an  Athenian  garrison  took over  but  left  the  city  after  the  defeat  at  Aigos  potamoi  in  405 (Xen.  Hell. 2.2.1).  After  their  victory,  the  Spartans  intro- duced  an  oligarchic  constitution  supervised  by  a  Spartan harmost  (Xen.  An. 6.2.13,  7.2.5\u00ad12)  perhaps  heading  a dekarchy  (Gehrke,  Stasis 36).  Stasis  between  factions  of  cit- izens  is  attested  for  the  following  period  (Xen.  An. 7.1.39; Diod. 14.12.2\u00ad3).In  390/89,with  the  help  of  the  leaders  of  the democratic  faction  (Dem. 20.60),  the  Athenians  under Thrasyboulos  were  admitted  to  the  city  and  had  the  consti- tution  replaced  by  a  democracy  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.270),  which seems  to  have  remained  in  force  for  the  rest  of  the  Classical period  (Theopomp.  fr. 62;  Arist.  Pol. 1291b23);  in  354/3  or slightly  later,  Byzantion  intervened  in  Kalchedon  (no. 743) and  introduced  a  democratic  constitution  there  (Dem. 15.26). Under  the  democracy,  citizenship  was  confined t o  those whose  parents  were  both  citizens.  During  a  financial crisis, however,  it  was  decreed  that  citizenship  could  be  bought  for 30  minas  (Arist.  Oec. 1346b26\u00ad29).The  civic  body  was  organ- ised  into  hekatostyes.  The  oldest  attestation  is  in  an  honorary decree  for  Eudamos  of  Seleukeia  of  c. 175\u00ad170  (IByz. 1.60\u00ad61). But  the  presence  of  hekatostyes  in  other  Megarian  colonies in  the  Black  Sea  area  (Kalchedon  (no. 743),  Herakleia  (no. 715)  and  Chersonesos  (no. 695))  and  in  the  mother  city  itself indicates  that  the  institution  goes  back  to  the  foundation  of Byzantion  (Jones,  POAG 284\u00ad85).  The  number  of hekatostyes  is  unknown.  At  Arist.  Oec. 1346b15  there  is  a  stray reference  to other  civic  subdivisions,  viz.  thiasoi  and  patrai, which,  however,  may  have  been  private  associations.  Free non-citizens  living  in  Byzantion  are  called  metoikoi  and were  barred  from  owning  landed  property (Arist.  Oec. 1347a1\u00ad3).  In  390/89  there  were a  large  number  of  Athenians living  in  the  city  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.27). The  eponymous  official of  Byzantion,  as  of  its  mother  city Megara  before  the  Hellenistic  period,  was  the  hieromnamon (epichoric  form  always  with  the  long  Doric  ) (IByz.  2.1 (C 2m);  cf.  Polyb. 4.52.4).  The  legends     and  on coins of  C 4m  probably  refer  to hieromnamones (Sch\u00f6nert-Geiss  ( 1970)  131\u00ad32  nos. 954\u00ad78).The  only  known public  enactment  of  the  Classical  period  is  an  honorary decree  (psephisma)  for  the  Athenians  passed  by  the Byzantians  in  341/0  and  read  out  to the  Athenian  Assembly (Dem. 18.89).  The  document  inserted  in  Demosthenes'  text 90\u00ad91,  however,  is  a  spurious  composition  of,  probably,  C 2 (Wankel  ( 1976)  497\u00ad98). The  patron  deity  of  Byzantion  may  have  been  Apollo,  as in  the  mother  city  Megara  and  in  other  Megarian  colonies (Hanell  ( 1934)  164\u00ad70).  In  Hellenistic  and  later  inscriptions, public  enactments  were  set  up  in  his  sanctuary  (IByz. 1.48\u00ad49,  63\u00ad64),  and  Apollo's  head  occurs  on  coins  of  C 4 (Sch\u00f6nert-Geiss  ( 1970)  nos. 951\u00ad953).  Games  may  be deduced  from  an  Archaic  inscription  mentioning  a  stadion- runner  (IByz. 42.3).  In  later  times  there  was  a  festival  called Bosporia  devoted  to  Artemis  Phosphoros--identified  with the  Thracian  Bendis--during which a t orch-race  was  held (IByz.p. 40). Very  little  is  known  from  contemporary  sources  about  the cult  places  of  Byzantion  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods. Hdt. 4.87.2  mentions  an  altar  of  Artemis  Orthosia  (a  typical- ly  Megarian  epithet),  a  temple  of  Dionysos  and  a  hieron  at  the entrance  to  the  Black  Sea  (apparently  not  to  be  identified w ith the  well-known  hieron  of  Zeus  Ourios  on  the  east  side  of Bosporos  but  rather  with  its  counterpart  on  the  west  side, called  Sarapieion  by  Polyb. 4.39.6).  Two  cult  places  are  men- tioned  in  a  Classical  context  by  Dion.  Byzant.  Anapl.  Bosp. 6.6\u00ad10,  G\u00fcngerich:  the  temple  of  Hera  which  is  said  to  have been  destroyed  by  the  Persians  and  the  temple  of  Plouton demolished  by Philip  of  Makedon.  Furthermore,  the  temple of  Poseidon  on  the  promontory  is  described  as  being  old ( 5.1\u00ad2).  For  a  list  of  cult  places,  some  of  which  may  have  orig- inated  in  the  Classical  period,  see  Miller  ( 1899)  1146\u00ad47. Byzantion  possessed  a  treasury  in  Olympia  (Paus. 6.19.9; Ath. 480A),  and  a  C 5e  dedication  of  Pythion  of  Byzantion  at Olympia  may  commemorate  a  victory  in  the  Olympic Games  (SEG 32  412). Names  of  the  months  are  attested  in  late  sources  only (IByz. 2,  30,  31,  33),  but  they  resemble  those  of  the  other Megarian  colonies:  Kalchedon  (no. 743),  Herakleia  Pontike (no. 715),Kallatis  (no. 686)  and  Chersonesos  (no. 695),and  a Megarian  origin  for  the  calendar  can  be  presumed  (Hanell ( 1934)  190\u00ad204;  Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 147\u00ad55). The  citadel  of  Byzantion  is  called  akra  at  Xen.  An. 7.1.19 and  akropolis  at 7.1.20.  It  was  situated  on  the  north-eastern propontic  thrace  917 tip  of  the  promontory  between  the  Golden  Horn and  the Propontis.  It  is  completely  covered  by  the  Topkapi  Saray  of the  Turkish  sultans,  and  there  are  no  physical  remains. Byzantion  had  a  defence  circuit  which,  according  to  later local  tradition,  had  been  erected  in  connection  with  the foundation  of  the  colony  (Hsch.  Patria 12).  The  walls  were renowned  for  their  strength  (Paus. 4.31.5),  and  the  descrip- tion  at  Dio  Cass. 75.10.3\u00ad6,  14.5\u00ad6  is  at  least  to  some  extent valid  for  the  Classical  period.  The  walls  with  numerous interval  towers  and  gates  (Xen.  An. 7.1.12,  15\u00ad17,  36;  Hell. 1.3.20)  were  particularly  strong  on  the  landward  side  to  the west;  the  sections  towards  the  sea  were  considerably  lower and  protected  against  breakers  by  a  mole  (Xen.  An. 7.1.17). During  the  siege  in  340  part  of  the  fortifications w ere strengthened  with  tombstones  and  was  thereafter  called \u00b5  (Hsch.  Patria 27).  The  original  fortifications of Byzantion  were  destroyed  by  Septimius  Severus  (Dio  Cass. 75.14.4\u00ad5);  no  traces  of  them  have  been  found.  Byzantion was  besieged  in  478/7  by  the  Greeks  (Thuc. 1.94.2),  in  409/8 by  the  Athenians  (Xen.  Hell. 1.3.14\u00ad20),  in  357/6  by  the Athenians  (Diod. 16.21.3)  and  in  340  by  Philip  of  Makedon (Dem. 8.14,  18.71,  93;Diod.  16.76.4,  77.2\u00ad3;Plut.  Phoc. 14.4\u00ad7).  The  city  also  possessed  within  its  walls  a  vast  unin- habited  area  called  Thrakion  (Xen.  Hell. 1.3.20;  An. 7.1.24), most  likely  intended  as  a  place  where  the  rural  population could  have  been  accommodated  during  a  war. There  are  no  remains  of  public  architecture  of  the  Archaic and  Classical  periods,  and  the  written  sources  are  silent apart  from  a  reference  to a  gymnasion  at  Arist.  Oec. 1346b19. The  context  indicates  that  it  was  situated  within  the  city walls.  The  existence  of  the  stadium  may  be  deduced  from  an Archaic  inscription  mentioning  a  stadion-runner  (IByz. 42). Byzantion's  important  commercial  activities  were  cen- tred  on  an  agora,  a  limen  and  an  emporion  (Theopomp.  fr. 62;  Arist.  Oec. 1346b18\u00ad19;Xen.  An. 7.1.19).  Byzantion  con- trolled  all  navigation  through  the  Bosporos  (supra);  it  some- times  seized  ships  belonging  to  other  poleis  (Arist.  Oec. 1346b30\u00ad31;Dem.  50.6),  and  during  the  Peloponnesian  War the  Athenians  (or  the  Delian  League)  exacted  dues  from grain  ships  passing  through  the  Bosporos  (IG i\u00b3  61.34\u00ad40 ( 426/5);  cf.  Rubel  ( 2001)). That  the  Byzantians  struck  coins  of  iron  in  C 5s  is  suggest- ed  in  old  Attic  comedies  (Ar.  Nub. 248  with  schol.;  Plato Com.  fr. 103,  PCG;Poll. 9.78;  Hsch.  s.v. ;  cf.  LSAG  p. 366).Not  a  single  specimen  has  survived.  The  minting  of  sil- ver  coins  started  c. 411.From 411  until  c. 387/6,  drachms and  hemidrachms  were  struck  on  the  Persian  standard,  and from  c. 387/86  until  c. 340/39  tetradrachms,  drachms  and hemidrachms  were  struck  on  the  Rhodian  standard.  The obv.  type  is  invariably  a  bull  above  a  dolphin,  legend:  BY  in Archaic  script  with  a  Corinthian  B;  rev.  types:  incuse  square punch,  or  trident  (on  drachms  of  Rhodian  standard).  In  the same  period  Byzantion  also  struck  some  small  denomina- tions  in  silver  with  the  same  types--probably t rihemiobols and  hemiobols  on  the  Persian  standard--and six series of bronze  coins  with  various  types.  Some  have  obv.  head  of Athena,  or  Demeter,  or  Apollo.  One  issue  has  the  rev.legend    or  ,  presumably  denoting  the eponymous  magistrate  (supra).  The  animal  of  the  bovidae family  frequently  occurring  on  the  coins  of  Byzantion  and designated  here  as  a  bull  is  sometimes  identified as a c ow and  connected  with  the  myth  of  Io  (Sch\u00f6nert  ( 1966)).  For the  alliance  coinage,  inscribed  ,see supra  (Sch\u00f6nert- Geiss  ( 1970);  SNG  Cop.  Thrace 475\u00ad85). 675.  Daminon  Teichos  (Daminoteichites) Map  52.  Lat. 41.05,long.  28.05.  Size  of  territory: 1.  Type:  B: ? The toponym is \u00b5   (Ps.-Skylax  67)  or   (Steph.  Byz. 222.2)  or  * \u00b5   (recon- structed  from  the  city-ethnic).  The  city-ethnic  is []  (IG i\u00b3  271.i.27)  or  \u00b5  (IG i\u00b3 272.i.38).  The  only  explicit  reference  to Daminon  Teichos  as a  polis  is  in  Steph.  Byz. 222.2.  It  is  here  considered  a  polis-- undoubtedly  a  fortified teichos--on  the  evidence  of  its  being a  member  of  the  Athenian  League  (Hellespontine  district). In  Ps.-Skylax 67,  Daminon  Teichos  is  listed  between Perinthos  (no. 678)  and  Selymbria  (no. 679).It  has  been  ten- tatively  identified w ith  Baunnae,a mutatio  situated  12  miles east  of  Perinthos-Herakleia  (It.

Daminon  Teichos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  in  the tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iii.11\u00ad12)  to  418/17  (IG i\u00b3 287.ii.20)  a  total  of  seventeen  times,  once  completely restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1,000  dr.  down  to  433/2  (IG i\u00b3 279.i.104),raised  to  2  tal., 4,000  dr.  in  430/29  (IG i\u00b3  281.iii.21), and  still  2  tal.  in  421/0  (IG i\u00b3  285.ii.84). 676.

Byz. 303.13)  is  plausibly  identified w ith  ` (Dem.3.4; F.Delphes iii.3207.3  (C 3m)).  The  city-ethnic  is  ` (IGBulg. i\u00b2  43.4,  Odessos  (C 1))  or  `  (ibid. 26)  or `  (Sayar  ( 1992)  190  (C 2l\u00adC1e)).  Heraion  is  called  a polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Hdt. 4.90.2  and  in  the  confused 918 loukopoulou  and  laitar entry  of  Steph.  Byz. 303.13\u00ad15,  who  seems  to  record  a  polis  and a  teichos  bearing  the  same  name.  The  collective and  internal use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  a  C 2l\u00adC1e  dedication  to Hermes  Agoraios  from  the  area  of  Rhaidestos/Tekir  Dag (Sayar  ( 1992)  190\u00ad95).  The  individual  and  external  use  is found  in  a  C 3m  decree  from  Delphi  (no. 177)  awarding  proxe- nia  to  two  of  its  citizens  (F.Delphes iii.3207.3)  and  in  a  C 1 honorary  decree  from  Odessos  (no. 689)  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  43). It  seems  quite  arbitrary  with  ATL  i. 482  to  identify  Heraion Teichos  with  Neon  Teichos  (no. 824)  and  Didymon  Teichos (no. 741);  see  also  Isaac  ( 1986)  203  and  Sayar  ( 1992)  191\u00ad92. Heraion  was  situated  on  the  northern  coast  of  the  Propontis, near  Perinthos  (no. 678),at  one  end  of  the  road  to  the  sources of  the  river  Tearos  and  thence  to  Apollonia  Pontike  (no. 682)--a t otal  of  four  days'  march (Hdt. 4.90.2).  It is  probably to  be  identified w ith  the  Roman  mutatio  Aerea  (It.  Burd. 601.6)  located  at  a  distance  of 16  miles  from  Herakleia (Perinthos)  and  12  miles  from  Registo  (  Rhaidestos);  cf. Hiereo  in  the  Tab.  Peut.;  Anon.  Rav. 4.6:  Ereon.  The  data recorded  in  the  Roman  Itineraria  fit an ancient settlement with  remains  of  Classical,  Hellenistic  and  Roman  date-- including  a  C 4  inscription--situated east of  the  mouth  of the  stream  Chitemblik,  in  the  bay  of  Karaevlialti,  c. 24  km west  of  Perinthos  (Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  100\u00ad2;  Sayar  ( 1992) 192  and  ( 1998)  62).In  Barr.  Heraion  Teichos  is  identified w ith the  prehistoric/Classical  settlement  near  the  tumulus  of Aytepe,  c. 12  km  north-west  of  Perinthos. According  to  Harp. 15  and  Etym.  Magn. 436.39\u00ad40, Heraion  Teichos  was  a  colony  of  Samos  (no. 864). Alternatively,  it  has  been  suggested  (Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  56, 100\u00ad2)  that  Heraion  was  a  secondary  colony,  i.e.  a  sanctuary of  the  Samian  Hera  founded  by  the  Samian  colonists  of Perinthos  (no. 678)  in  the  chora  of  the  latter  city;  but,  for  fear of  barbarian  incursions,  it  later  developed  into  a  self-gov- erning  and  strongly  fortified settlement.  Heraion  Teichos  is not  attested  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists,  but  in  C 4m  it  is mentioned  as  an  important  stronghold  under  Kersebleptes' rule,  successfully  besieged  by  Philip  II  in  352  (Dem. 3.4). 677. ", "Perinthos": "Identifier: 921, (Perinthios) Map  52.  Lat. 41.00,long. 28.00.  Size  of  territory 5.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is , (Hdt. 5.2.2;  Arist.  Gen.  an. 773a27),  after Perinthos  of  Epidauros,  the  associate  of  Orestes  (Steph.  Byz. 517.18)  or  one  of  Herakles'  lovers  (schol.  Ap.  Rhod. 1.1207b, Wendel).  In  the  third  or  fourth  century  ad,  Perinthos'  name was  changed  to  Herakleia,  after  Herakles,  its  mythical  ktistes (Amm.  Marc. 22.8.6;  see  Sayar  ( 1998)  171,EZ1;  Leschhorn ( 1984)  370).  The  city-ethnic  is  (Xen.  Hell. 1.1.21; SEG 12  391,  Samos  (C 6f)).  Perinthos  is  called  a  polis  in  the urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skylax  67;  see  also  Hdt. 6.33.1: (sc. ) and Diod.  16.74\u00ad76  (r 340).  The  political  sense  is attested  in  IG ii\u00b2  43.78  and 84,  where  Perinthos  under  the heading is listed as one of  the  members  of  the  Second Athenian  Naval  League.  Perinthos  is  called  asty  at  Xen.  Hell. 1.1.21.  The  term  politai  for  Perinthians  is  used  in  Arist.  Oec. 1351a  (rC 4f).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  in  its  full form  is  attested  internally  on  C 4m  bronze  coins  (infra)  and externally  in  the  ATL  and  on  the  stele  listing  the  members  of the  Second  Naval  League  (infra).  The  individual  ethnic  is used  externally  in  a  C 4\u00adC3  comedy  by  Lynceus  (fr. 1.2,  PCG) and  in  a  Delphic  inscription  (F.Delphes iii.3207.3  ( 252/1)). The  name  of  Herakleia  survives  in  modern  Marmara Ereglisi,  the  town  now  occupying  the  site  of  ancient Perinthos-Herakleia  (Sayar  ( 1998)  59\u00ad62).  Situated  at  a  dis- tance  of 630  stadia  west  of  Byzantion  according  to Artemidoros  ( 600  according  to  Demetrios  of  Skepsis  in Strabo  7  fr. 56),  it  was  situated  west  of  Selymbria  (no. 679) (Ps.-Skymnos  714\u00ad15)  between  Neon  Teichos  and  Daminon Teichos  (no. 675)  (Ps.-Skylax  67).  For  the  identification of Perinthos  with  Marmara  Ereglisi,  see  Robert  ( 1974a)  and, more  recently,  Sayar  ( 1998). propontic  thrace  919 The  territory  of  Perinthos  was  rigidly  demarcated  to  the east  by  the  rival  presence  of  the  Megarian  colonies  of Selymbria  (no. 679)  and  Byzantion  (no. 674)  (Loukopoulou ( 1989)  53\u00ad61);  a  plausible  natural  frontier  line  has  been sought  in  the  region  of  Kinalik\u00f6pr\u00fc  (Sayar  ( 1998)  64).  From C 5m,  an  independent  settlement--Daminon T eichos  (no. 675)--is r ecorded  between  Perinthos  and  Selymbria. Moreover,  at  least  during  the  period  of  Persian  occupation in  C 5e,  but  probably  also  from  the  start,  the  territory of Perinthos  was  significantly e xtended  westwards,  since  it appears  to have included  not  only  Tyrodiza  (no. 681)  (Hdt. 7.25  (r 480))  but  presumably  also  Heraion  [Teichos]  (no. 676)  and  Bisanthe  (no. 673);  see  Hdt. 6.33.1  where  Perinthos, Selymbria  and  Byzantion  are  the  only  poleis  listed  along  the northern  Propontic  shore,  and  Perinthos  is  associated  with         (Kahrstedt  ( 1954)  9\u00ad10). Subsequently,  however,  when  Perinthos  was  a  member  of the  Delian  League,  its  territory  must  have  been  restricted  to the  immediate  hinterland  and  have  bordered  on  that  of Heraion  Teichos  (Kahrstedt  ( 1954)  21;  Sayar  ( 1998)  62\u00ad64). To  the  north,  the  springs  of  the  river  Degirmen  are  believed to  have  constituted  a  plausible  border  (Sayar  ( 1998)  63). Perinthos  was  a  colony  of  Samos  (no. 864)  (Ps.-Skymnos 714\u00ad15;Strabo 7  fr. 56;Plut.  Mor. 303E)  and  was  founded  in 602  (Hieron.  Chron. 98b,  Helm)  on  the  northern-- Thracian--coast of  the  Propontis  (Hdt. 5.1.1\u00ad2,  6.33.1;  Ps.- Skylax 67).  The  names  of  three  of  the  old  Ionic  phylai  are attested  in  an  undated  list  of  names,  probably  of  ephebes (SGDI 5723;  cf.  Jones,  POAG 286).  During  its  early  years (c. 570\u00ad560),  Samian  Perinthos  faced  deadly  attacks  both from  invading  Paionian  hordes  (Hdt. 5.1;Strabo 7  fr. 41)  and from  its  rival  Megarian  neighbours,  who  attempted  to monopolise  the  Propontic  coast  but  were  repulsed  with  the assistance  of  forces  from  the  mother  city  (Plut.  Mor. 303E\u00ad304A;  cf.  Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  54\u00ad56).  Following Dareios'  Skythian  expedition,  Perinthos  was  subdued  by  the Persians  under  Megabazos  (Hdt. 5.1\u00ad2);  after  the  Ionian Revolt,  it  fell  under  Persian  rule  (Hdt. 6.33.1).  Following  the expulsion  of  the  Persians  from  Thrace,  Perinthos  became  a member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the Hellespontine  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists from  452/1  (IG i\u00b3  261.v.3)  to  418/17  (IG i\u00b3  287.ii.22)  a  total  of twelve  times,  twice  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 10  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  269.ii.25),  perhaps  less  in  418/17.In 411  it  proba- bly  joined  the  revolt  of  Byzantion  (no. 674),only  to  be  forced back  into  the  League  by  Alkibiades  in  410  (Xen.  Hell. 1.1.21). Perinthian  cavalry  forces  seem  to  be  indicated  by  Xen.  An. 7.2.8.  Perinthos  joined  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League  in 377  (IG ii\u00b2  43.84);  it  fell  temporarily  under  the  rule  of Ariobarzanes,  and  suffered  variously  under  the  pressure  of the  expansionist  ambitions  of  Kotys,  the  Odrysian  king (Dem. 23.142;  cf.  Arist.  Oec. 1351a;  cf.  Isaac  ( 1986)  207).  The inability  of  Athens  to  provide  effective  protection  against the  renewed  Thracian  oppression  under  Kotys'  successor Kersebleptes  and  the  general  Charidemos  (Dem. 23.165, 168),  in  352/1  drove  Perinthos,  together  with  Byzantion  and Amadokos,  to  conclude  an  alliance  with  Philip  II (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 318;  schol.  Aeschin. 2.81;  cf.  Sayar  ( 1998)  72 with  nn. 145\u00ad46).  After  the  defeat  of  Kersebleptes,  Perinthos and  Byzantion  are  believed  to  have  established  a  sympoliteia (Polyb. 18.2.3\u00ad5;  cf.  Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  147\u00ad48;  Sayar  ( 1998) 72  with  n. 147).  A  few  years  later  ( 340),  when  the  two  cities refused  to  support  the  Makedonian  king's  anti-Athenian operations  in  the  Chersonesos  area,  first P erinthos  and  sub- sequently  Selymbria  and  Byzantion  were unsuccessfully besieged  by  the  Makedonian  army  (Theopomp.  frr. 217,  292; Philoch.  fr. 162  (cf.  fr. 54);  Ephor.  T  10;Diod.  16.74\u00ad76;for a complete  list  of  testimonia,  cf.  Sayar  ( 1998)  51\u00ad79).Perinthos joined  Byzantion  in  voting  unprecedented  honours  for Athens  in  gratitude  for  her  decisive  support  on  this  occasion (Dem. 18.89\u00ad91).  The  alliance  with  Philip  was  eventually renewed  after  the  defeat  of  Athens  at  Chaironeia,  and  in  337 Perinthos  joined  the  Makedonian  king's  Hellenic  League together  with  the  rest  of  the  Greek  cities  in  Thrace  (Sayar ( 1998)  73). The  probable  predominance  of  the  cult  of  Hera (Polias?) is  attested  by  epigraphical  evidence  of  the  persistent  devo- tion  of  the  early  colonists  to  the  Hera  of  Samos  (SEG 12  391; cf.  Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  97\u00ad100),  by the  existence  of  a Heraion  (  Heraion  Teichos)  in  the  neighbourhood  of Perinthos--initially probably on P erinthian  territory itself--(cf.  Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  100\u00ad2),  and  by  Perinthian coin  types  of  Roman  date  (Sch\u00f6nert  ( 1965)  134  nos. 255\u00ad58; cf.  Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  102\u00ad3  and  the  recent  publication  of a  C 1\u00adC2  inscribed  votive stele:  Sayar  ( 1998)  no. 289).  The cults  of  other  Greek  divinities,  such  as  Zeus,  Athena,  Apollo, Artemis,  Dionysos,  Demeter,  Isis/Sarapis  and  Kybele,  are presumed  from  archaeological  evidence  and  numismatic iconography  (Sch\u00f6nert  ( 1965)  55\u00ad57;  cf.  Robert  ( 1967)  106ff; Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  103;  Sayar  ( 1998)  65).  The  calendar  of Perinthos,  preserved  through  lexicographic  tradition,  indi- cates  a  close  connection  with  the  calendar  of  metropolitan Samos,  at  least  in  its  presumed  Archaic  form,  supporting  the hypothesis  of  a  direct  implantation  in  the  colony  of  the  reli- gious  life  of  Samos  as  well  (Samuel  ( 1972)  88\u00ad89;  Tr\u00fcmpy, Monat. 81ff);  cf.  Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  96\u00ad103). 920 loukopoulou  and  laitar Perinthos  occupied  a  headland  1,200  m  long  and  50  m high,  linked  to  the  Thracian  mainland  by  an  isthmus  c. 200 m 1  stadion  wide  (Diod. 16.76;  cf.  Plin.  HN 4.47)  and  pro- jecting  eastwards  to  form  a  well-protected  harbour  (cf.   \u00b5  in  Ps.-Skylax  67).  Its  naturally  fortified position  was  enhanced  by  strong  defensive  walls  with  towers (Diod. 16.74)  capable  of  withstanding  a  prolonged  siege (Xen.  An. 7.2.10;Diod.  16.74ff,  following  Ephor.  (r 340/39). The  area  enclosed  by  the  walls  measured  c. 75  ha.  According to Hdt. 5.1.2,  there  was  a  ,  a  term  that  probably signifies the area immediately outside the city wall,  east  of the  neck  of  the  peninsula.  The  urban  centre  (called  an  asty  in Xen.  Hell. 1.1.21),  with  closely  packed,  exceptionally  tall houses,  overtopping  one  another  along  the  hill  slope  and separated  by  narrow  alley-ways,  had  the  appearance  of  a theatre (Diod. 16.76.2).  Moreover,  the  privileged  location  of Perinthos  at  the  intersection  of  important  land  and  sea routes  accounts  for  its  importance  as  a  market  (Xen.  An. 7.4.2,  6.24). Archaeological  investigation  in  Marmara  Ereglisi  has identified the location of  two  ancient  harbours,  to  the north-east  and  west  of  the  isthmus  of  the  peninsula,  with traces  of  ancient  breakwaters;  the  western  harbour  is  now completely  silted  up  by  alluvial  deposits  from  the  Baglar stream  (Oberhummer  ( 1938)  803\u00ad4;  Sayar  ( 1998)  59).Visible remains  of  the  fortification system,  dated  as  early  as  C 5,have also  been  identified,  protecting  the  acropolis  (located  on  the higher,  western  part  of  the  peninsula),  as  well  as  the  lower city,  mainly  from  the  north  and  west  (Sayar  ( 1998)  60,  with refs.).  The  cavea  of  the  theatre  (diameter  140  m)  can  be  seen on  the  southern  slope  of  the  acropolis,  and  there  are  traces  of the  stadion  ( 240  m  long,  undated)  on  the  west  slope  of  the acropolis  (ibid.  with  refs.).  The  cemetery  extended  over  3\u00ad5 km  to  the  north  and  west  of  the  city  walls  (Sayar  ( 1998) 60\u00ad61,  with  refs.). In C 4m,Perinthos  struck  coins  of  silver  and  bronze  on  the Persian  standard.  Silver  issues  included  didrachms, hemidrachms  and  obols.  Types:  obv.  head  of  Zeus,  or Demeter;  rev.  foreparts  of  two  horses  joined  back  to back; legend: or ,  sometimes  also  the  first letters of, probably,  a mint  magistrate's  name,  e.g. .  The  bronze coins  have  the  legend  (Head,  HN \u00b2270; Sch\u00f6nert-Geiss  ( 1965),  ( 1973);  SNG  Cop.  Thrace 721\u00ad22). 679.Selymbria  (Selymbrianos) Map  52.  Lat. 41.05,long. 28.15.  Size  of  territory: 4.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is \u00b5,  (Xen.  An. 7.5.15;  cf.  Hdt. 6.33.1)  or   (Polyb. 18.49.2)  or  (IG i\u00b3  1154B.5  ( 460\u00ad450)).  The toponym  is  allegedly  derived  from  and ,  the Thracian  word  for  polis  (Strabo  7.6.1).  The  city-ethnic  is \u00b5  (Pl.  Prt. 316D)  or  (IG i\u00b3  118.13 ( 408))  or  (Arist. Oec. 1348b33)  or (IG ii\u00b2  10261a  (C 4m)).  Selymbria  is  called  a polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skylax  67;  see  also  Hdt. 6.33.1: (sc. ).  The  political  sense  is  attested  in  Dem. 15.26;  Arist.  Oec. 1348b35  and  IG ii\u00b2  43.78  and  B 29,where Selymbria  under  the  heading  is  listed  as  one  of  the members  of  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League.  The  politeia of  the  Selymbrians  is  mentioned  in  the  treaty  with  the Athenians  of 408  (IG i\u00b3  118.10\u00ad11).Epigraphic  evidence  indi- cates  that  Selymbria  had  become  a  kome  of  Byzantion  or  of Perinthos  in  the  Roman  period  (Robert  ( 1946));  its  absence from  the  list  of  Delphic  theorodokoi  in  C 3l  being  a  probable terminus  ante  quem,  Selymbria  may  have lost  its  autonomy at  the  time  of  the  formation  of  the  sympoliteia  between Byzantion  (no. 674)  and  Perinthos  (no. 678),  tentatively dated  to  the  period  of  Philip  II's  unsuccessful  efforts  in  340 to  bring  the  area  under  Makedonian  control.  The  collective use  of  the  city-ethnic  (abbreviated  as  ) is attested internally  on  C 5  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  the  treaty with  Athens  (IG i\u00b3  118.30)  and  in  Pl.  Prt. 316D.The  individual ethnic  is  used  externally  in  the  C 5l  settlement  with  Athens (IG i\u00b3  118.42)  and  in  a  C 5m  epigram  commemorating Pythagoras,  son  of  Dionysios,  a  Selymbrian  proxenos  of Athens  (IG i\u00b3  1154).  Patris  is  found  in  IG i\u00b3  1154B  (C 5m). Selymbria  is  mentioned  at  Hdt. 6.33.1  as  a  polis  east  of Perinthos  and  the  Thracian  teiche,  and  west  of  Byzantion, and  in  Ps.-Skylax  67  it  is  recorded  as  a  polis  and  a  limen  situ- ated  500  stadia  from  the  mouth  of  the  Black  Sea.  Selymbria is  identified w ith  modern  Silivri,  which  preserves  a  variant form  of  the  ancient  name.  For  sparse  antiquities  collected locally  mostly  during  the  nineteenth  century,  see  Seure ( 1912)  and  Loukopoulou  ( 1989)  27\u00ad38  with  refs.  Literary sources  attest  the  existence  of  fortifications from C 5l  (Diod. 13.66.4,14.12.7;Plut.Alc.30.2)  to  C 4m  (Dem. 18.77,for  which see  infra). According  to  Ps.-Skymnos  715\u00ad16,Selymbria  was  founded by Megara (no. 225)  \"before  Byzantion\",  some  time  in  the  sec- ond  quarter  of  C 7  (Isaac  ( 1986)  210;  Loukopoulou  ( 1989) 51\u00ad53).The  exact  limits  of  its  territory  remain  unidentified;  it bordered  the  territory of  Daminon  Teichos  (no. 675)  to  the west,  that  of  Byzantion  (no. 674)  to  the  east--with two r ivers, Athyras  and  Bathynias,  mentioned  in  the  border  area (Strabo  7  fr. 56;  cf.

The  city-ethnic  is  (Krateros  (FGrHist 342)  fr. 3  IG i\u00b3  100).  The  only  source  to  call  Tyrodiza  a  polis is  Steph.  Byz. 642.18.According  to  Herodotos,  it  belonged  to the  Perinthians  (no. 678)  (Hdt. 7.25:    ),  implying  that  it  was  a  possession  of  Perinthos (ATL  i. 558);  It  could,  however,  mean  \"a  colony  or  founda- tion  of  the  Perinthians\"  (see  e.g.  Thuc. 2.30.1,  4.49.1).  It  is here  considered  to  be  a  polis,  at  least  in  C 5s,  on  the  evidence of  the  Athenian  tribute  lists,  where  it  is  recorded  among  pay- ing  members  of  the  League.  Only  the  collective  and  external use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  (supra). Tyrodiza  is  usually  identified w ith  Teiristasis,  one  of  the Thracian  teiche  recorded  by Ps.-Skylax  67  on  the  north-west 922 loukopoulou  and  laitar shore  of  the  Propontis,  between  the  isthmus  of  the Chersonesos  and  Perinthos  (cf.  Dem. 12.3;  schol.  Dem. 12.1.1),  which  is  plausibly  identified w ith  mediaeval Peristasis modern  Peristeri present-day  Sharkeui  (ATL i. 558;  but  see  Isaac  ( 1986)  203\u00ad4).  According  to  Steph. Byz. 642.18,  Tyrodiza  was  situated  \"after\"  (i.e.  east  of) Serrion. Tyrodiza  is  recorded  as  one  of  the  supply  bases  of  Xerxes' army  in  480  (Hdt 7.25).  Tyrodiza  was  a  member  of  the Delian  League.  It  belonged  to  the  Hellespontine  district  and is  recorded  by  toponym  in  the  tribute  lists  of 452/1  (IG i\u00b3 261.iv.30),  446/5  (IG i\u00b3  266.i.22)  and  445/4  (IG i\u00b3  267.i.30), paying  1,000  dr.  the  first y ear,  a  sum  reduced  to  500  dr.  in 446/5  and 445/4  (IG i3  266.i.22;  267.i.30),  presumably  fol- lowing  the  establishment  of  Athenian  klerouchs  shortly before  450  (cf.  IG i\u00b3  417.9:  [] (448/7)).  For  a possible  relation  with  the  Athenian  klerouchy  settled  c. 450 in  Neapolis  (no. 677),  see  ATL  iii. 205;  Kahrstedt  ( 1954)  22 and  Isaac  ( 1986)  204.  Tyrodiza  appears  again  in  the  assess- ment  decree  of 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.108;  cf.  Krateros  fr. 3  (IG i\u00b3 100)).  If  the  identification w ith  Teiristasis  is  correct, Tyrodiza  and  its  neighbour  Krobyle  were  exposed  to andrapodismos  by  the  Athenian  general  Diopeithes  in  341 (Dem. 12.3;  cf.

The  only  explicit  reference  to Bisanthe  as  a  polis  is  in  Steph.  Byz. 171.3;  cf.  oppidum  in  Plin. HN 4.11.43.But polis  status  in  the  Classical  period  can  be inferred  from  the  attestation  of  Bisanthe  in  the  Athenian assessment  decree  of 422/1  (infra),  combined  with  the Hellenistic  evidence  (C 3f  coins,  attestation  in  the  C 3l Delphic  theorodokoi  list  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iii.96);  cf.  Robert ( 1948)  54\u00ad55).  The  internal  and  collective  form  of  the  city- ethnic  appears  on  Hellenistic  coins  (supra).  The  external and  individual  use  is  attested  in  Hellenistic  inscriptions  (IG xii.9  1126  (C?),  from  Chalkis;  F.Delphes iii.4  133  i.18,  ii.27\u00ad28 ( 208)). Bisanthe  was  situated  on  the  Thracian  coast  of  the Propontis  and,  on  the  evidence  of  Ptol.  Geog. 3.11.4,  it  is  usu- ally  identified w ith  mediaeval  Rhaidestos modern Tekirdag.  However,  Sayar  ( 1992)  187\u00ad89  and  ( 1998) 62\u00ad63  has  recently  defended  the  alternative  equation  of Bisanthe  with  Paniai  in  Ps.-Skylax  67,  a  conjecture  of MS Byzantine  Panion  and  modern  Panados/ Baniado/Barbaros  (ATL  i. 475\u00ad76;  cf.  Isaac  ( 1986)  213).  The identification w ith  Tekirdag  seems  preferable. Bisanthe  was  a  colony  founded  by the  Samians  (no. 864) (Steph.  Byz. 171.3:  \u00b5;Pompon.  2.24: Bisanthe  Samiorum).  It  may  initially  have  belonged  to  the extended  territory  of  Perinthos  (no. 678)  as  a  dependent polis,  like  Tyrodiza  (no. 681),  whose  fate  it  must  have  shared during  C 6l  and  C 5e.  However,  it  is  usually  believed  to  have fallen  under  Odrysian  rule  in  430,  when  a  Peloponnesian 914 loukopoulou  and  laitar embassy  on  its  way  to  meet  the  Persian  king  was  treacher- ously  arrested  by  Sitalkes  and  Nymphodoros  in  Bisanthe and  extradited  to  the  Athenians  (Hdt. 7.137.2\u00ad3;  cf.  Thuc. 2.67). Bisanthe  is  indisputably  listed  as  a  member  of  the  Delian League  in  the  assessment  decree  of 422/1  (IG i\u00b3  77.iv.10)  and as  belonging  to  the  Hellespontine  district,  and  the  toponym is  restored  in  the  assessment  decrees  of 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.20) and 410/9  (IG i\u00b3  100.iii.9).  It  is  recorded  alongside  Paktye, Ornoi  and  Neon  Teichos  as  one  of  the  strongholds  (teiche) held  soon  after  410  by  Alkibiades,  who  appears  to  have  close- ly  collaborated  with  the  Thracian  kings  Medokos  and Seuthes  (Plut.  Alc. 30.10  (r 408),  36.3\u00ad5;Lys.  10.4;Diod. 13.105.3\u00ad4;Nep.  Alc. 7.4;  cf.  Lys. 14.26).  A  few  years  later ( 400\u00ad399),  Bisanthe--the fairest of  Seuthes'  possessions  on the  coast--was r epeatedly  offered  to  Xenophon  by  the Thracian  dynast  Seuthes  II  (Xen.

The  city-ethnic  is (IG i\u00b3  71.iii.105\u00ad6). Neapolis  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League,  and  the tribute  lists  and  assessment  decree  (Hellespontine  district) constitute  the  only  sources  for  this  community.

A  location  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Thracian  Chersonesos  has been  inferred  from  the  qualifying  epithet   [],  and  the  epithet  '   indicates  that it  was  an  Athenian  foundation.

Neapolis was  further  equated,  without  positive  evidence,  with Herakleia,  one  of  the  Thracian  teiche  listed  by Ps.-Skylax ( 67;  cf.  Ptol.

Brentesion  is  called  a  polis  in  late sources  only,  in  Polyb. 10.1.9  referring  to the  Roman  colony of  C 3m  and  retrospectively  in  Strabo  6.3.6  referring  to the mythical  period.  Strabo  describes  Brentesion  as  a  barbarian city  in  territory  opposed  to  that  of  the  Tarantines  and  with  a Messapian  name.  However,  its  status  as  a  Greek  or  at  least partly  Hellenised  polis  of  the  Classical  period  is  indicated  by a  C 5m  kerykeion  inscribed  \u00b5 .  \u00b5 (IG xiv  672  Jeffery,  LSAG 284  no. 13,  pl. 54), perhaps  a  testimony  of  an  alliance  between  Brentesion  and Thourioi  (De  Simone  ( 1956);  Greco  ( 1993)  302).Though  not explicitly  mentioned  in  the  sources,  Brentesion  must  have played  a  leading  role  in  the  Iapygian  wars  with  Taras  (no. 71) and  Rhegion  (no. 68)  (Hdt. 7.170.3;Diod.  11.52  (r 473)).  The importance  of  its  use  as  a  port  is  attested  in  Hdt. 4.99.5, where  we  find the t erm  limen.  \u00b5  at Strabo  6.3.6  concerns  the  mythical  period  but  may  refer  to the  Messapian  kingships  (C 5).  A  boule  of  the  Brendisioi  is known from  a  late  source (Roman),  but  it  is  of  some  import- ance  because  it  refers  to  a  Greek  philosopher  (IG xiv  674; Ghinatti  ( 1996)  120).  The  foundation  story  of  Brentesion has  Cretan  elements  (Strabo  6.3.6),  as  has  the  origin  of  the Iapygians  (Hdt. 7.170.2;  Antiochos  (FGrHist 555)  fr. 6),  per- haps  an  indication  of  early  Hellenisation.  According  to Strabo  6.3.6,  Phalanthos  of  Taras  settled  in  Brentesion  when the  adriatic  329 he  had  been  exiled  from  Taras,  a  tradition  perhaps  reflecting early  contacts  between  the  Greek  colony  and  Iapygia (Fantasia  ( 1972)  119\u00ad20). The  epigraphic  evidence  is  mainly  Messapian,  the  Greek inscriptions  being  primarily  from  the  Roman  period.

For  the  individual and  external  use,  see  \u00b5  (Polyb. 2.65.5 (r 222)). Pharos  was  a  colony  (apoikia)  founded  by  Paros  (no. 509) in 385  with  the  assistance  of  Dionysios  I  of  Syracuse  accord- ing  to Diod. 15.13.4,  14.1\u00ad2,  whereas  only  Paros  is  mentioned as  the  founder  by Ephor.  fr. 89,  by  Ps.-Skymnos  426\u00ad27,  and by Strabo 7.5.5.  Two decrees  of  C 3l,  one  passed  by  the  polis  of Pharos,  the  other  by  the  polis  of  Paros,  refer  to Pharos  as  a colony  of  Paros  (SEG 23  489a11\u00ad16,  29\u00ad30;  for  the  date:  SEG 43  349).Archaeological  evidence  suggests  the  possibility  that the  colony  of 385  was  preceded  by  \"pre-colonial\"  Greek  set- tlement  (Gaffney  et al.( 2002)). Pharos,  modern  Stari  Grad,  lies  innermost  in  a  narrow bay  on  the  north  side  of  the  island  of  Pharos  (modern Hvar).  The  fertile  hinterland  (plain  of  Jelsa),  c. 20  km \u00b2,is cut  off  from  the  rest  of  the  island  by  a  mountain  range;  the the  adriatic  333 easternmost  part  of  the  plain  was  retained  under  Illyrian control  (Kirigin  ( 1990)  296  fig. 3,  301\u00ad2).  The  chora  shows traces  of  a  land  division,  with  1,000  200  m  lots,  which  may go  back  to  the  Greek  period  (cf.  Hellenistic(?)  horos  stone: Brunsmid ( 1898)  20.5;  Cambi  ( 2002)  56\u00ad57;  Slapsak ( 2002)). The  Greek  settlers  found  the  site  occupied  by  Illyrians  (pre- Greek  defences:  Kirigin  ( 1990)  299;  cf.  Diod. 15.14.1),  and  an armed  conflict between the Illyrians and the c olonists  was won  by  the  colonists  only  because  the  Syracusan  command- er  in,  probably,  Issa  (no. 81)  sent  a  squadron  (Diod. 15.14.1\u00ad2; see,  Stylianou  ( 1998)  193\u00ad97,  and  supra 332). There  are  few  urban  remains;  the  size  of  the  Greek  city  is estimated  to  comprise  between  1.5  ha  and  6  ha  (Kirigin ( 1990)  299;  Cambi  ( 2002)  56\u00ad57).  According  to  Diodorus, the  Parian  settlers  fortified their city (Diod. 15.14.1),  and there  are  traces  of  circuit  walls  in  \"Cyclopean\"  and  in masonry  technique  (Zaninovi  \u017dc  ( 1976b);  Cambi  ( 2002)  56, 70);  for  remains  of  walls  and  for  local  pottery,  see  Jelicic- Radoni  \u017dc  ( 2002)  and  Kirigin  et al.( 2002).

Apollonia  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the urban  sense  (Hdt. 9.93.1,  94.2;  Ps.-Skylax 26)  and  in  the political  sense  (Arist.  Pol. 1290b11\u00ad12).  In  the  accounts  of  the Delphic  naopoioi,  Apollonia  is  listed  under  the  heading     (CID ii  4.i.14,  ii.1\u00ad22  ( 360)).  The  cit- izens  are  described  as  astoi  in  Hdt. 9.93\u00ad94.  The  collective use  of  the  ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  the  dedication  on  a victory  memorial  set  up  by  the  Apolloniates  at  Olympia (CEG 390  I.Apoll. 303),  also  cited  by  Paus. 5.22.3  (cf.  infra), and  in  CEG 809  I.Apoll. 307  (C 4m).  The  individual  use  of the  ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  literary  sources  (Hdt. 9.92.2)  and  in  inscriptions  (F.Delphes iii.14.3  I.Apoll. 304 (C 4f);  IG ii\u00b2  350.10  SEG 35  77  (C 4s)). According  to  Thuc. 1.26.2,  Apollonia  was  founded  by Corinthians  (no. 227)  only  (cf.  Braccesi  ( 1977)  92  n. 4),  and according  to Plut.  Mor. 552E  the  contingent  was  led  by Periander,  which  suggests  a  date  of  c. 600  for  the  foundation. According  to  a  variant  tradition,  a  contingent  of 200 Corinthians  was  led  by  one  Gylax,  after  whom  the  city  was named  Gylakeia  (Steph.  Byz. 105.22,  214.9\u00ad10;  cf.  in  a  second  century  ad  inscription  from  Apollonia, I.Apoll. 213).  Alternatively,  Ps.-Skymnos  439\u00ad40  and  Strabo 7.5.8  claim  that  Apollonia  was  founded  by colonists  from Corinth  and  Korkyra  (no. 123)  (I.Dyrrh. 29).  In  Pol. 1303a25\u00ad28,36\u00ad38,Aristotle  adduces  Apollonia  as  an  (undat- ed)  example  of  stasis  caused  by  the  arrival  of  new  colonists. The  foundation  myth  told  by  the  Apolloniates  was  that  their city  had  been  founded  by  Apollo  (CEG 390  I.Apoll. 303  Paus. 5.22.3;  cf.  coins  of  the  Roman  period  (Head, HN \u00b2314)). The  tradition  mentioning  Periander  indicates  that  the foundation  took  place  during  his  reign,  although  his  personal involvement  remains  uncertain  (cf.  Berve  ( 1967)  21;  Salmon ( 1984)  211;  foundation  chronology  c. 600:  Van  Compernolle ( 1953);  Ducat  ( 1962)  174\u00ad78).The  foundation  of  Apollonia  and Epidamnos  (no. 79)  probably  reflects C orinthian  expansion in  the  Adriatic  after  the  subjugation  of  Korkyra  (Salmon ( 1984)  222\u00ad24)  and  Corinthian  trade  attracted  by  the  mineral wealth  of  the  region  (Braccesi  ( 1977)  98\u00ad103). The  lack  of  Protocorinthian  pottery  confirms a founda- tion  date  of  c. 600  (Mano  ( 1983)  232\u00ad34;  Apollonia  d'Illyrie  iv . 855).  The  population  was  Hellenic,  and  the  colonists  from Corinth  and  Korkyra  were  reinforced  by  most  of  the  inhab- itants  of  Dyspontion  (no. 250)  near  Olympia,  who  are  said to  have  fled t o  Epidamnos  and  Apollonia  after  the  destruc- tion  of  their  city  c. 570  (Strabo  8.3.32;  Ducat  ( 1962)  175\u00ad76). The  growth  and  territorial  aspirations  of  Apollonia  may have  led  to  conflict w ith  neighbouring  settlements,  such  as the  C 5m  war  with  Thronion  in  the  Abantis  attested  in  the inscription  from  Olympia  (also  cited  by  Paus. 5.22.3)  which commemorates  spoils  taken  from  Thronion  by the Apolloniates  (I.Apoll. 303  (C 5m);  cf.  Hammond  ( 1967) 493\u00ad95).  Paus. 5.22.4  records  that  spoils  were  also  given  to the  Corinthians.  For  Apollonia's  dominance  over  Thronion and  Byllis  (no. 92),  see  Hammond  ( 1967)  523.  In  the  conflict between  Corinth  and  Korkyra  in  435  Apollonia  sided  with Corinth  (Thuc. 1.26.2;  see  Salmon  ( 1984)  274\u00ad80).  In  C 4m the  Apolloniates  are  listed  in  the  Corinthian  inscription commemorating  Timoleon's victory  over  Carthage  at  the river  Krimissos  in  344  (CEG 809  I.Apoll. 307;  see  Talbert ( 1974)  76\u00ad77). The  constitution  was  organised  democratically,  but offices of  state  were restricted  to the  descendants  of  the  orig- inal  colonists,  who  constituted  a  minority  of  the  citizens (Arist.  Pol. 1290b11\u00ad14).  This  peculiar  form  of  democracy may  have  been  preceded  by  an  oligarchy  which  was  over- turned  because  the  ruling  oligarchs  embezzled  public money  (Arist.  Pol. 1305b39\u00ad40  with 1306a6\u00ad9).  However,  the chronology  is  uncertain,  and  the  sequence  of  constitutions may  have  been  the  opposite  (cf.  Aubonnet  in  the  Bud\u00e9  edn., p. 161  n. 5).  The  polis  was  famous  for  its  good  laws ( \u00b5,Strabo 7.5.8),  and  is  reputed  to  have  prac- tised  expulsion  of  foreigners  (xenelasia)  on  the  Spartan model  (Ael.  VH 13.15).There  is  a  C 4s  Delphic  proxeny  decree for  a  citizen  of  Apollonia  (I.Apoll. 310),and  an  Apolloniate  is granted  isopoliteia  in  the  Molossian  kingdom  by a  federal decree  of  c. 343\u00ad331  (I.Apoll. 308).  Apollonia  figures in the C 4s  Argive list  of  theorodokoi  as  one  of  the  most  northerly cities  of  the  itinerary  (SEG 23  189.i.14  I.Apoll. 309). Communal  oracle  consultations  at  Dodona  and  Delphi  are reported  in  an  anecdote  told  at  Hdt. 9.93\u00ad95;  cf.  Fontenrose 328 wilkes  and  fischer-hansen ( 1978)  Q 161.  Meneptolemos  of  Apollonia  was  victorious  in the  boys'  race  c. 504\u00ad500  (Paus. 6.14.13;  Olympionikai 162). The  colony  was  founded  near  the  coast,   ' (Hdt. 9.92.2),  in  the  land  of  the  Taulantioi  (Ps.- Skylax 26),  and  now  lies  between  the  estuaries  of  the  river Seman  (ancient  Apsos)  and  the  river  Vjos\u00eb  (ancient  Aous)  at modern  Pojani  in  southern  Albania  (morphology  and  site plan:  Apollonia  d'Illyrie  i. 523\u00ad26  fig. 3).  The  name  of  the  territory  was    (Hdt. 9.93.1,  94.2). Coin  finds show that C 4  Apollonia  had  contacts  over  a  wide territory,  perhaps  as  extensive  as  modern  Albania  (Mano ( 1976)  fig. 3).  There  are  traces  of  indigenous  settlements  and ancient  routes  in  the  territory  (Praschniker  ( 1922\u00ad24)  fig. 2), remains  of  a  C 4  Doric  temple  of  unknown  cult  at  Stylassi c. 800  m  south  of  the  city,  no  longer  extant  (Praschniker ( 1922\u00ad24)  40\u00ad42  fig. 14;  I.Dyrrh. 14),and  some  indications  of a  river  harbour  on  the  Aous  (Praschniker  ( 1922\u00ad24)  55\u00ad57). Most  of  the  urban  remains  are  Hellenistic  or  Roman,  and are  dispersed  along  the  crest  and  on  the  slopes  of  the  range of  hills  on  which  the  city  was  founded.  A  C 6?  ashlar  circuit wall  fortified the acropolis and upper settlement area ( c. 20 ha).  The  lower  city  (c. 110  ha)  was  protected  by  an  extensive C 4\u00adC3  ashlar  and  brick  circuit  wall,  furnished  with  a  num- ber  of  gates  (Koch  ( 1989)  218\u00ad20;  Apollonia  d'Illyrie  ii. 763\u00ad78;  Apollonia  d'Illyrie  iii. 977\u00ad85;  Apollonia  d'Illyrie  iv. 857\u00ad60);  the  city  withstood  sieges  in  C 4l  (Diod. 19.70.7 (r 314);  81.1  (r 312)).  A  C 6s  Doric  hexastyle  temple  was  raised on  the  southern  peak  of  the  acropolis;  fragments  of  a  C 6 sculptural  frieze  reveal  Ionic  traits.  The  cult  was  that  of Apollo  (I.Apoll. 315.51)  and  possibly  Artemis  (Apollonia d'Illyrie  i. 529).  Public  buildings  below  the  acropolis  consist of  a  C 4s  urban  temple  (Apollonia  d'Illyrie  iii. 976),  a  C 3m theatre  seating  c. 8,000  (Isler,  TGR  i. 227),  C 4\u00adC3  stoas  and  a C 3  nymphaeum  (Strabo  9.3.16;see Koch ( 1989)  222\u00ad25),  and various  structures  probably  from  the  time  of  Dionysios  I (Lamboley  ( 2002)).  There  are  vestiges  of  an  urban  layout dating  to  450\u00ad380,  with  a  street  grid  of 61  m 61  m  and streets  5.95\u00ad6.30  m  wide  (Koch  ( 1989)  218\u00ad19). The  cemeteries  were  laid  out  in  the  Kryegyata  valley  east of  the  city:  C 7l\u00adC5  tumuli  and  sarcophagi,  C 4\u00adC3  chamber tombs,  C 3\u00adC1  cremation  tombs  (Ceka  ( 1994a);  Apollonia d'Illyrie  iv. 854\u00ad56).  Tomb  gifts  and  rites  were  similar  to those  at  Epidamnos  and  Korkyra  (Mano  ( 1983)  232). The  major  cult  was  probably  that  of  Apollo,  as  indicated by  the  foundation  myth  (supra)  as  well  as  the  name  of  the city.  Also,  the  Apolloniatans  dedicated  summer  crops  fash- ioned  in  gold  to  the  Delphic  Apollo  (Plut.  Mor. 402A).Other communal  cults  are  Helios  (Hdt. 9.93)  and  Artemis,  also  fre- quently  invoked  (I.Apoll. 1,33).C3l  inscriptions  with  dedica- tions  to  Artemis  Limnatis  and  Artemis  Proscopa  show  the importance  of  her  cult  (cf.  Cabanes  ( 1986)  152\u00ad55,  and  coin evidence). The  calendar  month  Haliotropios  (I.Apoll. 315.2)  and Psydreos (I.Apoll. 387  (C 4l))  are  known  also  from  Ambrakia, Bouthrotos,  Dodona,  Epidamnos  and  Korkyra,  and  suggest a  Corinthian  origin  for  the  calendar  (Hadzis  ( 1994); Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 155\u00ad59). Apollonia  struck  silver  coins  c. 450\u00ad350.  Denominations: stater  (didrachms),  tridrachms  and  drachms.  Korkyraian types:  obv.  cow  suckling  calf;  rev.  stellate  squares;  legend: (SNG  Cop.  Illyricum 370).  Bronze  coins  were struck from  C 4l.

That  Issa  was  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  too  is  indicated by  its  mint  (infra)  and  the  colonisation  decree  of  c. 300 (infra).  The  collective  and  internal  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  in  the  colonisation  decree  (Syll. \u00b3141.2)  and  on  C 3 bronze  coins  (infra). According  to Ps.-Skymnos  413\u00ad14,  Issa  was  a  Syracusan foundation  (apoikia),  and  this  tradition  is  confirmed b y  some of  the  names  of  the  c. 250  Issaian  colonists  sent  to  Melaina Korkyra (no. 83)  (SEG 40  511,43  348).Issa  is  normally  believed to  have  been  founded  by  Dionysios  I  in  connection  with  his the  adriatic  331 establishment  of  colonies  in  the  Adriatic  (Diod. 15.13.1\u00ad5 (r 385);  see  esp.  Braccesi  ( 1977)  230\u00ad32;  Stylianou  ( 1998)  196), although  there  is  no  unequivocal  literary  or  archaeological evidence  for  this  (cf.  Beaumont  ( 1936)  202;  and  see  infra),  and archaeological  evidence  indicates  a  settlement  of  Greeks prior  to Dionysios'  interference  (Sanader  ( 2002)),just  as  spo- radic  finds of  Archaic  Greek  pottery  from  Issa  and  Pharos attest  earlier  contacts  with  the  Greek  world;  also,  the  hero Ionios,  though  first attested on C 4  coins  from  Issa  (infra), may  have  had  an  earlier  cult  on  the  island  of  Issa  (Braccesi ( 1977)  75\u00ad76,  229  n. 106). Issa  served  as  a  naval  station  when  Dionysios'  governor (eparchos)  of  Issa  in  384  engaged  in  a  naval  battle  against  the Illyrians  in  support  of  the  Knidian  colony  of  Pharos  (Diod. 15.14.2,where is a plausible conjecture for MSS  or or (Vial  (Bud\u00e9),  followed  by  Fraser  ( 1993) 169  and  Stylianou  ( 1998)  197;  the  emendation  is  rejected  by Woodhead  ( 1970)  508  n. 1  and  Braccesi  ( 1977)  227\u00ad32;how- ever,  the  distance  makes  it  unlikely  that  Dionysios'  ships came  from  Lissos).  The  presence  of  a  Syracusan  eparchos  at Issa  indicates  that  the  colony  was  a  dependent  polis. The  main  source  for  the  political  organisation  of  Issa  is  a colonisation  decree  of  c. 300\u00ad250  (Syll. \u00b3141  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 451),passed  by  the  demos  (l. 3:   \u00b5).The epony- mous  official is a hieromnamon  (l. 1),  and  the  Issaians  sent  as colonists  to  Melaina  Korkyra  are  divided  into  the  three Doric  tribes:  Dymanes,  Hylleis  and  Pamphyloi  ( 18ff).  The decree  was  passed  in  the  month  of  Machaneus  ( 1),  also attested  in  the  Korkyraian  calendar  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 161). The  decree  was  previously  connected  with  Dionysios  I's activities  in  the  northern  Adriatic  and  dated  c. 385  (Syll. \u00b3 141),  but  has  later  been  downdated  to c. 300  (Fraser  ( 1993) 170ff;  C 4\u00adC3  in  LGPN 3)  or  C 3f  (Rendi\u017dc-Miocevi\u017dc ( 1965); Woodhead  ( 1970)  508\u00ad10;  cf.  SEG 43  348). Issa  is  situated  at  modern  Vis  on  the  north  side  of  the island  off  the  coast  of  ancient  Dalmatia,  on  a  slope  on  the west  side  of  a  large  bay,  one  of  the  largest  natural  ports  of Dalmatia.  The  immediate  hinterland  covers  about  1,000  ha, but  Issa  probably  controlled  the  entire  island,  a  territory of about 140  km \u00b2.  Possible  evidence  for  Greek  land  division  is identified b y  Zaninovi\u017dc  ( 2002).  Greek  finds go back t o  the Archaic  period,  though  the  nature  of  the  finds is uncertain (Kirigin  ( 1990)  303,  310).  There  are  few  urban  remains  of  the C 4  Greek  city.  The  C 4  circuit  wall,  built  in  ashlar  technique, may  have  had  an  Archaic  predecessor  (ibid.  ( 1990)  303).  The C 4  wall  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 9.8  ha.  There  are  traces  of  a street  grid  and  habitation  structures  (Zaninovi\u017dc  ( 1976a); Kirigin  ( 1990);  Cambi  ( 2002)  49\u00ad55).  The  known  cemetery is  Hellenistic  (Kirigin  ( 1990)  303).  The  present  archaeologi- cal  record  indicates  that  there  was  no  Greek  settlement before  c. 330  (Kirigin  ( 1990)  310;  cf.  Vison\u00e0  ( 1995)  56\u00ad57),  but \"Only  approximately  10%  of  the  city  of  Issa  is  said  to  have been  explored  thus  far\"  (Vison\u00e0  ( 1995)  57  n. 10),  and  the archaeological  record  is  not  necessarily  incompatible  with  a foundation  date  in  the  reign  of  Dionysios  I. Issa  struck  bronze  coins  from  C 4f  (Gorini  ( 1993))  or  C 4s (Vison\u00e0  ( 1995);  Mandini  \u017dc  and  Vison\u00e0  ( 2002)):  ( 1)  according to  Gorini  ( 1993),  overstrikes  on  Dionysian  issues;  according to Vison\u00e0  ( 1995),  rather  c. 330\u00ad320  transitional  issues  to  Issa's civic  issues.

Its  status  as a  polis  in  the  political  sense  is  indicated  by  the  C 4  mint (infra). Herakleia  had  a  harbour  (limen,  Ps.-Skylax 22),  but  its location  has  not  been  established  satisfactorily.  Its  origin  is unknown,  though  most  scholars  take  it  to  be  one  of  the Adriatic  foundations  of  Dionysios  I  (see  coin  evidence below).  Herakleia  is  usually  located  on  the  island  of  Pharos, where  most  of  the  coins  have  been  found  (Brunsmid ( 1898) 54;  Dukat  and  Mirnik  ( 1976)  181\u00ad82.  For  a  recent  suvey  of coin  distribution,  see  Kirigin  ( 1990)  294\u00ad95).  Attempts  to identify  Herakleia  with  various  sites  in  the  eastern  Adriatic, such  as  the  Knidian  foundation  on  Korkyra  Melaina,  are unconvincing  (Braccesi  ( 1977)  106\u00ad8).

The  collective  and  internal  form  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attest- ed  on  C 2  coins  (SNG  Cop.  Illyricum 524: ). Lissos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Diod. 15.13.4 (rC 4e). Lissos  was  founded  shortly  before  385  by  Dionysios  I (Diod. 15.13.4;  following  Vial  (Bud\u00e9),  Stylianou  ( 1998)  194 defends  the  MS  reading  against  the  emendation ,  preferred  by  e.g.  Beloch  ( 1922)  118  n. 2). Lissos  was  founded  on  the  steep  slope  of  a  hill,  modern Lezha,  on  the  south  bank  of  the  river  Drin,  near  its  estuary (anc.  Drilo)  (May  ( 1946)  54\u00ad56),  a  site  already  occupied  by Illyrian  settlers  (Prendi  and  Zheku  ( 1972)).  The  site  of Akrolissos,  listed  by  Strabo  7.5.8  as  a  polis  apart,  is  normally identified as the fortress lying above Lissos on the height of Mali  Selbuemit,  an  interpretation  indicated  by  Polyb. 8.13.1, who  describes  this  as  a  fortress  separated  from  the  city  itself  (for  the  topography  of  Lissos  and  Akrolissos,  see Praschniker  and  Schober  ( 1919)). Extensive circuit  walls  are  from  different  phases:  a  C 4 phase  comprised  only  an  upper  acropolis  of  c. 2.3  ha.  Walls  in ashlar  blocks,  strengthened  with  square  towers,  were  raised down  the  slope  of  the  hill  to  the  river  Drin  in  C 3\u00adC2;  with  a perimeter  of 2,150  m  they  enclosed  a  lower  settlement  area  of c. 22  ha  (Prendi  and  Zheku  ( 1972);  Fraser  ( 1993)  169  n. 17). Diateichisma  walls  divided  the  city  into  zones,  perhaps  based upon  different  functions.  The  city  had  a  harbour  on  the  river bank  (Koch  ( 1989)  140\u00ad43;  Ceka  ( 1990)  222\u00ad23  fig. 11).  The urban  features  are  rather  similar  to  those  of  local  Illyrian sites,  but  the  south-west  gateway  is  very  sophisticated  and 332 wilkes  and  fischer-hansen shows  characteristics  of  Syracusan  (Dionysian)  C 4  military architecture.  Although  the  archaeological  remains,  includ- ing  the  circuit  wall,  are  now  dated  mainly  to  the  Hellenistic period,  it  cannot  be  precluded  that  Lissos  was  a  Dionysian foundation  on  a  smaller  scale  (Stylianou  ( 1998)  194). 83.

Type:  A: .The toponym  ,  (Ps.-Skymnos  428;Strabo 7.5.5.)  is  used  for  both  the  island  and  the  city  (Strabo  7.5.5). The  city-ethnic  is  attested  on  C 3  coins  (infra). The  colony  is  referred  to  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  in  the colonisation  decree  passed  by  the  Issaians  (no. 81;  Syll. \u00b3 141.4,  9,  17)  and  in  some  late  sources  (Strabo  7.5.5;  Plin.  HN 3.152:  oppidum).  That  it  was  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  too is  indicated  by  the  C 3  coins  (infra). According  to  Ps.-Skymnos  428,Strabo 7.5.5  and  Plin.  HN 3.152,  Melaina  Korkyra  was  a  Knidian  colony.  But  a  C 4\u00adC3 decree  passed  by  the  Issaians  and  found  in  modern Lumbarda  (probably ancient  Melaina  Korkyra)  lays down regulations  for  an  ab  novo  colonisation  by  Issaians (Syll. \u00b3141).  Some  historians  assume  that  there  were  two colonies  on  the  island,  the  first one founded b y  Knidians  in perhaps  C 6  (Beaumont  ( 1936)  174)--unlocated,  but  per- haps  situated  at  Vela  Luka  on  the  west  coast--and the other founded  by  Issaians--situated at modern L umbarda  on  the east  coast--see (Braccesi ( 1977)  104\u00ad6;  Kirigin  ( 1990)  293).A preferable  reconstruction  seems  to be  that  the  original Knidian  settlement  had  died  out  before  the  new  Issaian foundation,  and  that  the  Issaians  were  resettling  a  place already  occupied  in  the  past  by  the  Greeks  (Graham  ( 1964) 43).Note,however,that  Melaina  Korkyra  was  still  referred  to as  a  Knidian  colony  in  the  Roman  period. The  foundation  by  Issaians  is  attested  in  the  inscription found  on  Korcula (Korkyra Melaina) near modern Lumbarda  (Syll. \u00b3141;  SEG 17  312,  19  435,  40  511,  43 348  Lombardo  ( 1993)  passim  with  rich bibliography; Lombardo  ( 2002))  now  dated  to  C 3f  (Woodhead  ( 1970) 508\u00ad9  following  Rendi\u017dc-Miocevi\u017dc  ( 1983)  192)  or  C 4\u00adC3 (Fraser  ( 1993)  170ff  and  LGPN 3),  see  also  Braccesi  ( 1977) 311\u00ad12.  The  decree  may  have  been  a  treaty  between  Issa  and the  otherwise  unknown  Illyrian  dynasts  Pyllos  and  Dazos, allowing  the  foundation  of  a  colony  on  their  territory (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 451).  Or  Pyllos  and  Dazos,  being  either Issaians  or  Illyrians,  were  the  oecists  of  the  colony  (Braccesi ( 1977)  310).The  Issaian  foundation  may  have  been  located  at Lumbarda,  where  the  inscription  was  found,  in  eastern Korcula;  for  archaeological  remains  and  discussion  of  the colony's  location,  see  Radi  \u017dc  and  Bass  ( 2002).  There  are  a  few urban  remains  and  a  C 3  cemetery  in  the  vicinity  (Braccesi ( 1977)  309\u00ad16;  Kirigin  ( 1990)  311).  On  the  walls  (Syll. \u00b3 141.4\u00ad5,  17),  see  Maier  ( 1959\u00ad61)  204\u00ad6.  The  settlers  were Dorians,  and  the  three  Dorian  tribes  Hylleis,  Dymanes  and Pamphyloi  are  named  in  the  inscription  (l. 18).  Onomastic studies  indicate  that  the  Issaian  colonisers  came  originally from  Syracuse  (no. 47)  (Fraser  ( 1993)),  but  there  was  an Illyrian  element  too  (Woodhead  ( 1970)  510).  The  inscrip- tion  throws  valuable  light  on  the  distribution  of  land  in  the city  and  in  the  chora  of  the  colony  (Asheri  ( 1971)).  For  possi- ble  traces  of  land  division,  see  Zaninovi\u017dc  ( 2002). A  rare series  of  C 4  bronze  coins  were struck  by the Korkyraians  of  Melaina  Korkyra,  whether  the  Knidian foundation  or  the  Issaian  is  not  clear.  Types:  obv.  Apollo;  rev. ear  of  corn;  legend: (Brunsmid ( 1898)  69 listing  specimens,  one  with  legend  (Dukat  and Mirnik  ( 1976)  182)).

The  later  toponym,  (Strabo  7.5.8),  is  first attested in the C 3l  Delphic  list  of  theo- rodokoi  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iv.57),  whereas  the  corresponding city-ethnic, ()  ,  is  attested  on  coins  as  early  as C 5m  (infra).  Epidamnos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense (Thuc. 1.24.1;  Ps.-Skylax 26),  in  the  territorial  sense  (Thuc. 1.24.5\u00ad6),and  in  the  political  sense  (Thuc. 1.25.1).In  Arist.  Pol. 1304a13\u00ad14,  Epidamnos  is  one  of  six  communities  subsumed under  the  heading  polis  ( 1303b32).  The  collective use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on  coins  (infra)  and  external- ly  in  Thuc. 1.24.1.  For  the  individual  and  external  use,  see \u00b5\u00b5 ' '\u00b5,  one  of  the  suit- ors  of  Agariste  of  Sikyon  (Hdt. 6.127.2  (r  c. 580)),  and  the  Attic citizenship  decree  for  a  named  Epidamnian  (IG ii\u00b2  350  SEG 35  77  (C 4s)).  It  is  implicitly  described  as  patre  ( patris)  in Hdt. 6.127.1\u00ad4. Epidamnos  was  founded  in  either  627  or 625  (Hieron. Chron. 97b,  Helm)  by  Korkyraians  (no. 123)  (Thuc. 1.24.1; Ps.-Skymnos  435\u00ad36)  assisted  by  some  Corinthians  (no. 227) and  other  Dorians  (Thuc. 1.24.2).  The  oecist  was   ' ,  a  descendant  of  Herakles,  and he  was  summoned  from  Korkyra's  metropolis  in  accordance with  ancestral  traditions  (Thuc. 1.24.2).  Epidamnos  and Apollonia  (no. 77)  were  the  only  true  C 7  colonies  in  the Adriatic,  the  outcome  of  Corinthian  expansion  and  trade attracted  by  the  mineral  wealth  of  the  region  (Braccesi ( 1977)  98\u00ad103).  In  c. 570  inhabitants  from  the  destroyed Eleian  city  of  Dyspontion  (no. 250)  migrated  to  Epidamnos and  Apollonia  (Strabo  8.3.32;  for  the  chronology:  Ducat ( 1962)  175\u00ad76).  The  city  was  strong  and  populous  (Thuc. 1.24.3),  but  civil  strife  over  many  years  ( ) and wars  with  the  neighbouring  indigenous  towns  left  it  weak. Internal  strife  led  ultimately  to  the  conflicts between Epidamnos,  Korkyra  and  Corinth.  C. 437  the  demos  expelled the  aristocratic  faction  (    ),  which  then  concluded an  alliance  with  the  neighbouring  peoples  and  with Korkyra.  In  435  Epidamnos  sent  envoys  (presbeis)  to Korkyra  pleading  mediation,  but  this  was  rejected  (Thuc. 1.24.5\u00ad7).  Following  the  advice  of  Delphi,  the  Epidamnians gave  up  their  colony  to  Corinth,  a  garrison  of  Corinthians was  sent  to  the  aid  of  Epidamnos,  and  the  Epidamnians  were reinforced  by  new  colonists  of  Corinthians,  Leukadians  (no. 126)  and  Ambrakiots  (no. 113)  (Thuc. 1.25),  who  obtained equal  rights  with  the  other  citizens  (Thuc. 1.27.1).  The  result was  a  siege  of  the  city  by  the  Korkyraians  and  the  exiled Epidamnians  (Thuc. 1.26.5).  The  war  between  Corinth  and Korkyra  led  to  the  defeat  of  the  Corinthian  fleet,  the  con- quest  of  Epidamnos  in  434,  and  the  reintroduction  of  an \"aristocratic\"  constitution  (for  the  \"Kerkyraika\"  (Thuc. 1.24\u00ad55),  see  Hornblower  ( 1991)  66\u00ad97;  Salmon  ( 1984) 282\u00ad85;  for  the  stasis,  see  Gehrke,  Stasis 60\u00ad62). There  are  few  sources  for  the  later  history  of  Epidamnos and  Apollonia  (no. 77),  but  in  the  C 4s  Illyrian  kings  came  to play  a  major  part.  Epidamnos  was  given  over  to  Glaukias, king  of  the  Illyrians,  by  the  Korkyraians  in  313  (Diod. 19.78.1), and  Illyrian  dynasts  may  have  been  in  power  before  this  if coin  legends  naming  Monoun,  basileos,are C 4s  and  refer  to the  father  of  Glaukias,  as  argued  by  Ceka  ( 1972)  25\u00ad27. The  constitution  was  originally  a  narrow  oligarchy  which was  changed  piecemeal  into  a  more  moderate  form  of  oli- garchy  (Arist.  Pol. 1301b14\u00ad15):  the  phylarchs  were  replaced by  a  council  (boule);  among  the  full  citizens  (politeuma)  the magistrates  were  under  obligation  to  attend  the  assembly (heliaia);  and  the  single  archon  was  another  oligarchic  element  of  the  constitution  (Arist.  Pol. 1301b21\u00ad25).  After  a stasis  probably  in  437,  the  oligarchic  constitution  was changed  into  a  democracy:  the  people  (demos)  exiled  the members  of  the  ruling  class  (hoi  dynatoi,  Thuc. 1.24.5),  and citizens  hitherto  excluded  from  the  politeia  were  apparently enfranchised  (Arist.  Pol. 1304a13\u00ad17).  But  in  433  the Epidamnian  democrats  had  to  surrender  the  city  to  the besieging  Korkyraians  on  the  following  terms:  the  new colonists  were  sold  into  slavery,  the  Corinthian  garrison  was imprisoned  (Thuc. 1.29.5),  and  the  exiles  were  restored  to Epidamnos  (Diod. 12.30.5).  As  a  result,  the  constitution  was changed  once  again:  one  supreme  official ( arche)  was  in charge  of  the  (financial) administration (Arist.  Pol. 1287a4\u00ad8),  and  another  official,  called  poletes,  was  in  charge of  all  trade  between  Epidamnos  and  its  barbarian  neigh- bours  (Plut.  Mor. 297F).Artisans  employed  on  public  works were  public  slaves  (Arist.  Pol. 1267b16\u00ad19). Epidamnos  was  situated  in  Illyris,  in  the  territory  of  the Taulantioi,  an  Illyrian  tribe  (ethnos,  Thuc. 1.24.1),  on  the coast  at  modern  Durr\u00ebs  in  central  Albania. 330 wilkes  and  fischer-hansen The  town  was  founded  on  an  isthmus  (Thuc. 1.26), according  to  some  later  sources  the  name  of  the  peninsula was  Dyrrhachion  (Eratosthenes  apud  Steph.  Byz. 244.10\u00ad11; cf.  Strabo  7.5.8),  whereas  according  to  App.  B  Civ. 2.39 Dyrrachion  was  the  name  of  the  harbour,  Epidamnos  the name  of  the  upper  city.  According  to  Paus. 6.10.8,  there  was a  short  distance  between  the  two  cities.  However,  there  is  no archaeological  evidence  for  separate  settlements.  The  few Greek  remains  lie  beneath  the  Roman,  mediaeval  and  mod- ern  city,  but  they  confirm a foundation date of  c. 625  (Hidri ( 1987));  see  also  D'Andria  ( 1990)  285  for  noteworthy  early Archaic  finds and also now Davis,  et  al.  ( 2003).  There  are architectural  remains  of  two  C 6l  sanctuaries  situated  on  the outskirts  of  the  modern  city,  but  the  location  in  relation  to the  ancient  city  is  unknown  (Korkuti  ( 1994)  403).  A  fortifi- cation  wall  is  implicitly  attested  for  the  430s  by Thuc. 1.26.5. A  cult  of  Herakles  is  deduced  from  a  C 6\u00adC5  relief  of Herakles  with  votive  inscription  (I.Dyrrh. 1);  a  C 4\u00adC3 inscription  mentions  Asklepios  (I.Dyrrh. 2);  and  a  C 4\u00adC3 inscription  the  theoi  megaloi  (I.Dyrrh. 3  (restored)).  Coins offer  evidence  of  cults  of  Herakles  and  Zeus  (infra). According  to  Paus. 6.19.8,  the  Epidamnians  dedicated  a treasury  at  Olympia,  now  identified in foundation III of  the Treasury  Terrace.  C 6s  roof  fragments  have  been  assigned  to the  building  (Mallwitz  ( 1972)  165\u00ad71;  Mertens-Horn  and Viola  ( 1990)  239\u00ad40).  Kleosthenes,  son  of  Pontis,  from Epidamnos,  was  victor  in  the  chariot  race  at  Olympia  in  516 (Paus. 6.10.6;  Olympionikai 141). The  names  of  the  months  Haliotropios  (I.Magnesia 46.3  Rigsby  no. 96),  Apellaios,  Machaneus  and  Panamos (I.Dyrrh. 580,  582\u00ad83)  suggest  a  Corinthian  origin  for  the calendar  (Hadzis  ( 1994):  Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 161). Dyrrhachion  struck  coins  ( 1)  c. 450\u00ad350,  staters  with Korkyraian  types:  obv.  cow  suckling  calf;  rev.  stellate squares;  legend: ,or (SNG  Cop.  Illyricum 421\u00ad28); ( 2)  c. 350\u00ad229,  staters  on  the  Corinthian  standard  and  with Corinthian  types:  obv.  Pegasos;  rev.  Athena,  behind  club; legend: ,  ,  (SNG  Cop.

Pegasos,  legend: or and )  struck  in  C 5  and  probably  prior  to the  Peloponnesian War  may  represent  the  earliest  coins  of  the  city  (using  the name  Epidamnos)  presumably  struck  in  collaboration  with Corinth  (no. 227).

The town  is  described  as  a  polisma  at  Thuc. 8.28.4.Politai  of  Iasos are  mentioned  in  a  proxeny  decree  of 333\u00ad323  (I.Iasos 30.4). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in decrees  (I.Iasos 32.6)  and  on  coins  (infra),  and  externally  in the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  279.i.69).  The  individual  use is  attested  internally  in  a  C 2  dedication  (I.Iasos 227.2)  and externally  in  a  C 4s  Attic  funerary  inscription  (IG ii\u00b2  8931). The  names  of  two  districts  (?)  in  the  territory  of  Iasos  are known  from  I.Iasos 1  ( ,ll.37and51,and, ll. 31  and 34). On  the  basis  of  the  800  adult  males  mentioned  by  Diod. 13.104.7  in 405,  Bean  and  Cook  ( 1957)  101  calculate  that  the urban  population  of  Iasos  must  have  numbered  c. 3,000  at the  time. Iasos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Karian  district  and  is  registered  in  the  tribute  lists  from 450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.v.21)  to  415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.i.12)  a  total  of  six- teen  times,  five times c ompletely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1  tal.  from  450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.v.21)  to  432/1  (IG i\u00b3  280.i.63),and 3  tal.  from  421/0  (IG i\u00b3  285.i.91).  In  412  Iasos  was  taken  by  the Spartans  at  the  instigation  of  Tissaphernes  (Thuc. 8.28.3); having  pillaged  the  town  and  apparently  exposed  its  popu- lation  to  an  andrapodismos,  the  Spartans  handed  it  over  to Tissaphernes  (Thuc. 8.28.4),  who  then  left  Iasos  with  a  gar- rison  (Thuc. 8.29.1);  but  the  city  must  have  joined  the Athenians  again,  because  it  is  called  an  Athenian  ally  in  405 by Diod. 13.104.7.Iasos  was  a  member  of  a  symmachia  attest- ed  exclusively  by  the  so-called  coinage  (whose  legend abbreviates  synmachon,  synmachikon  or  synmachia  vel  sim.) karia  1117 dating  to  C 5l\u00adC4e;  the  other  poleis  striking  coins  were Byzantion  (no. 674),  Ephesos  (no. 844),  Knidos  (no. 903), Kyzikos  (no. 747),  Lampsakos  (no. 748),  Rhodos  (no. 1000) and  Samos  (no. 864)  (Karwiese  ( 1980);  Debord  ( 1999) 273\u00ad77). Lysander  took  Iasos  in  405,  killed  the  male  population  of military  age  ( 800  men),  sold  women  and  children  as  slaves, and  razed  the  city  to  the  ground  (Diod. 13.104.7;  the  MSS have   ,  which  Palmer  has  emended  to    ;  but  cf.  Xen.  Hell. 2.1.15  and  infra  no. 899).  In C 4m  Iasos  belonged  to  the  Hekatomnid  Empire  (I.Iasos i ( 367\u00ad354)). Iasos  had  a  boule  and  a  demos  (I.Iasos 32.4),  called  ekklesia (SEG 40  959.15  (c. 330\u00ad325?))  which  met  once  every  month (I.Iasos 32.2)  and  the  first-coming cizitens w ere  paid  for attendance  (SEG 40  959.4\u00ad6:  ekklesiastikon).  The  meetings were  presided  over  by an  epistates  (I.Iasos 32.2\u00ad3),  and  the proposals  were  moved  mostly  by  a  board  of  prytaneis (I.Iasos 52.3)  in  accordance  with  the  probouleumatic procedure:       \u00b5  (I.Iasos 32.4; Rhodes,  DGS 338).  The  eponymous  official was a stephanophoros  (I.Iasos 32.1).  Public  enactments  were  pub- lished  by  the  neopoiai,  sometimes  in  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo (I.Iasos 42.8),  sometimes  in  an  archeion  (I.Iasos 30.12).  The fact  that  decrees  (psephismata,  I.Iasos 42.8)  were  passed  reg- ularly  by  the  boule  and  the  demos  and  that  citizens  were  paid for  attendance  indicates  that  Iasos  had  a  democratic  consti- tution  (Hornblower  ( 1982)  111;  Rhodes,  DGS 340).  The Aristotelian  collection  of  politeiai  included  one  of  Iasos (Heracl.  Lemb. 73;  cf.  Gigon  no. 66). Copious  information  about  officials is obtained from a decree  of 367\u00ad354  which  deals  with  plots  against  Mausolos and  the  polis  of  Iasos  (I.Iasos 1).  The  property of  the  plotters is  being  sold,  and  it  appears  that  the  transactions  were undertaken  by four  archontes  ( 6\u00ad8),  four  tamiai  ( 8\u00ad9),  two astynomoi  ( 10),  four  synegoroi  ( 11\u00ad12),  six  prytaneis  ( 12\u00ad14), eleven  priests  of  Zeus  Megistos  ( 16\u00ad18)  and,  finally,  a  num- ber  of  representatives  of  the  phylai,  i.e.  citizens  ( 18ff;  Jones, POAG 333).  Another  decree,  of  c. 330,  mentions  prostatai (I.Iasos 20.12).  A  keryx  from  Iasos  is  mentioned  in  the  C 4m treaty  between  Mylasa  (no. 913)  and  Kindye  (no. 902)  (SEG 40  991.13). The  citizens  were  subdivided  into  phylai  and  patriai (I.Iasos 47.4  (C 4l)).Each  phyle  seems  to  have  been  headed  by an  official called neopoies  (SEG 40  959.14  and 17)  and  if  the six  names  recorded  in  ll. 2\u00ad4  are  those  of  the  neopoiai (Gauthier  ( 1990)  425\u00ad26),  there  must  have  been  six  phylai (Jones,  POAG 333).  Both  grants  of  proxenia  and  citizenship are  attested  in  the  C 4  decrees  (I.Iasos 32,42;  SEG 36  983,rein- scribed  in  C 3\u00adC2  SEG 38  1059).  The  three  men  granted proxeny  by Iasos--Myrmex,  Manes  and  Targelios,  sons  of Peldemis--may be identical w ith  the  three  unnamed  sons  of Peldemos  (the  variations  in  spelling  may  be  due  to  problems in  transcribing)  who  were  punished  for  plotting  against Mausolos  (SEG 36  983;  cf.  Bl\u00fcmel  (( 1998b)  171).  Iasos  is  reg- istered  in  the  Argive  list  of  theorodokoi  of  c. 330  (SEG 23 189.17) A  cult  and  priest  of  Zeus  Megistos  attested  in  a  C 4  lex sacra  (LSAM 59  I.Iasos 220),  and  investigations  inside  the temple  of  Zeus  and  Hera  have  revealed  sherds  which  show that  the  temple  was  in  use  at  least  from  C 6  to  the  Hellenistic period  (Berti  ( 1987)  33\u00ad34).A  cult  of  Artemis  Astias  is  attest- ed  in  a  C 4  dedication  (I.Iasos 259.3\u00ad4;  also  mentioned  by Polyb. 16.12.4).  For  a  sanctuary  of  Apollo  where  public enactments  were  set  up,  see  I.Iasos 42.8.A grave  connected  to the  so-called  heroon  dates  to  C 5  (Berti  ( 1995)). In  Antiquity  Iasos  was  situated  on  a  small  island,  which  is now  joined  to  the  mainland  by  an  isthmus.  Harbours  are mentioned  in  a  decree  of  c. 300  (I.Iasos 3.6,  14,  25).  The  city on  the  island  was  surrounded  by  a  wall  in  isodomic  ashlar masonry  (Hornblower  ( 1982)  317).  The  wall  is  c. 2.4  km  long (thus  longer  than  the  1.8  km  stated  by  Polyb. 16.12.2);  it encloses  an  area  of  c. 26  ha  and  is  built  in  various  types  of masonry;  it  is  now  dated  to  the  period  after  Alexander's  con- quest  of  Asia  Minor  (McNicoll  ( 1997)  109\u00ad11).  Dry  rubble masonry  on  the  acropolis  dates  from  the  Protogeometric  or Geometric  period  (ibid. 111).  On  the  mainland  there  is  a massive  wall  the  purpose  of  which  has  puzzled  scholars.  The date  of  the  wall  is  also  uncertain,  but  a  C 4l  date  seems  plau- sible  (Hornblower  ( 1982)  317  with  n. 184,but McNicoll ( 1997)  117  suggests  the  time  of  Philip  V).  The  extant  wall  has a  length  of  c. 3.5  km  and  is  built  with  crudely  trimmed  rec- tangular  blocks.  The  wall  has  many  jogs  and  towers  (Winter ( 1971)  241\u00ad43;  Lawrence  ( 1979)  184\u00ad87).  The  function  of  the wall  seems  to  be  purely  military;  thus,  there  is  general  agree- ment  that  there  were  no  buildings  on  the  mainland  (Winter ( 1971)  242\u00ad43). Iasos  struck  alliance  coins  (silver  staters)  c. 394.Type:  obv. head  of  Apollo;  rev.  infant  Herakles  strangling  serpents;  leg- end: ,  interpreted  as  or (HN \u00b2621;Kraay ( 1976)  248);  for  the   coins,  see  Karwiese  ( 1980)).  Other  coins,  struck  for  Iasos alone,  have  obv.  Apollo;  rev.  incuse  square  with  lyre;  legend: (SNG  Cop.  Caria 408). Two  Karian  graffiti incised on C 5s  sherds  have  been  found at  Iasos.  The  letters  are  similar  to  those  in  the  Karian  inscrip- 1118 flensted-jensen tions  from  Killareis  and  Chalketor  (Berti  and  Innocente ( 1998)).  The  c. 100  names  recorded  in  I.Iasos 1  are  mostly Greek,  which  suggests  that  in  C 4m  Iasos  was  a  Hellenic  com- munity  (Bl\u00fcmel  ( 1990)  38\u00ad42  (  SEG 40  991\u00ad92)). 892.

Mylasa  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  (Arist.  Oec. 1348a12)  and  in  the  political  sense  in  a  decree  of 361/0 (I.Mylasa 2.7\u00ad9).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  internally  in  the  decree  of 367/6  (I.Mylasa 1.3)  and externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  267.v.31).  The individual  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  a  C 4m  dedica- tion  from  Labraunda  (I.Labraunda 17)  and  in  a  C 4  Attic sepulchral  inscription  (Agora xvii  519.7). In  the  territory of  Mylasa  were several  forts,  one  of  which is  described  at  length  by  Radt  ( 1969\u00ad70).  The  fortification consists  of  a  ring  wall  and,  inside  that,  a  fortified citadel.  The whole  complex  is  c. 400  m  long,  and  the  oldest  parts  were built  in  the  Archaio-Classical  period  with  additions  in  the early  Hellenistic  period.  In  addition  to  the  three  fortifica- tions  already  known,  yet  another  one  was  discovered  in  1995. The  masonry  is  of  the  Classical  period,  and  it  overlooks  the plain  of  Mylasa,  but  also  Hydai  to  the  west  (Rumscheid ( 1996)  127). The  name  of  the  district  (or  perhaps  ; see  Bl\u00fcmel  ( 1998a)  165  n. 9)  in  the  territory  of  Mylasa  is known  from  I.Mylasa 21.8  (c. 317). Mylasa  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Karian  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from 450/49  (IG i\u00b3  263.i.12)  to  440/39  (IG i\u00b3272.ii.76,  completely restored)  a  total  of  eight  times,  twice  completely  restored. Mylasa  paid  1  tal.  down to 447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.ii.105)  and  5,200 dr.  from  446/5  on  (IG i\u00b3  267.v.31). Crampa  argues  that  a  very  fragmentary  C 4l  inscription concerns  the  democratic  constitution  of Mylasa (I.Labraunda 41;  see  other  possible  restorations  and  inter- pretations  in  Hornblower  ( 1982)  70\u00ad71  with  n. 128). Nomoi  patrioi  are  mentioned  in  I.Mylasa 1.11  ( 367/6). A  single  Ionian  month  name  is  attested  at  Mylasa  (SEG 40 991.2: \u00b5  [ ]\u00b5  (C 4m)). Three  phylai  are  attested  at  Mylasa.  A  decree  of 367/6 mentions     (I.Mylasa 1.4;cf.I.Mylasa  2.4,3.13). The  name  of  the  phyle '  is  attested  frequently from  C 2  (see  e.g.  I.Mylasa 106.2); `  is  attested once,  in  C 2  (I.Mylasa 301.3);  and  is  attest- ed  once,  in  C 2  (I.Mylasa 119.14). In 357\u00ad355  Erythrai  (no. 845)  bestowed  proxeny  and  other honours  upon   `\u00b5  (Tod 155).  In  C 4\u00adC3  Delphi  (no. 177)  bestowed  proxeny  on    (SEG 23  307). One  inscription  contains  three  decrees,  dated  to  367/6, 361/0  and 355/4  respectively,  dealing  with  plots  against Mausolos  (Tod  138  I.Mylasa 1\u00ad3).  In  the  first case A rlissis, son  of  Thyssollos,  had  been  sent  as  an  envoy  to  the  Persian king  by  the  Karians  and,  while  an  envoy,  had  plotted  against Mausolos  and  was  subsequently  executed  on  the  king's orders.  Moreover,  the  polis  of  Mylasa  seized  his  property and handed  it  over  to  Mausolos.  In  the  second  case,  the  sons  of Peldemos  had  damaged  an  image  of  Hekatomnos,  father  of Mausolos,  thus  wronging  the  sacred  dedications,  and  the polis  therefore  confiscated their property and sold it.  They may  have  sought  refuge  in  Iasos  (no. 891),  because  proxeny was  granted  in  C 4  to  three  men:  Myrmex,  Manes  and Targelios,  sons  of  Peldemis  (SEG 36  983;  cf.  Bl\u00fcmel  ( 1998b) 171).  In  the  third  case  Manita,  son  of  Paktyes,  plotted  against Mausolos  during  the  annual  offering  and  festival  of  Zeus Labrandeus.  Manitas  himself  was  killed  immediately  in hand-to-hand  fighting,  and  the  polis  confiscated the proper- ty  of  Manitas  and  his  accomplice  Thyssos,  son  of  Syskos,  and sold  their  estates.  In  all  three  cases  the  decrees  are  passed  by the  assembly,  with  the  ratification of  the  three  phylai,  and curses  are  invoked  on  anyone  who  puts  a  question  to  the vote  or  proposes  something  which  would  change  these  decisions. Hdt. 1.171.6  mentions  a  sanctuary  dedicated  to  Zeus Karios  and  calls  it  \"ancient\".  Zeus  Karios  was  also  wor- shipped  by  the  Mysians  and  the  Lydians  (Hdt. 1.171.6). Remains  survive  of  the  wall  surrounding  the  temenos  of  the temple  of  Zeus  Osogos;  it  probably  dates  to C 5  (Bean  ( 1971) 42).  A  temenos  of  Hermes  and  Herakles  is  attested  c. 317 (I.Mylasa 21.13). The  cult  centre  of  Mylasa  was  the  sanctuary  of  Zeus  at Labraunda,  situated  c. 15  km  north  of  Mylasa  and  connected to  it  by  a  sacred  way.  Annual  sacrifices and a panegyris  are mentioned  at  I.Mylasa i3.4\u00ad5.Strabo  mentions  the  road  and says  that  it  measured  60  stades  ( 10.8  km)  ( 14.2.23).  The  road, of  which  parts  have  been  preserved,  was  constructed  in  the Hekatomnid  period  (Westholm  ( 1963)  9\u00ad10).The  sanctuary consists  of  several  buildings:  the  temple  itself  (for  which  see Hellstr\u00f6m  and  Thieme  ( 1982)),  a  peristyle,  two  andrones, two  stoas  and  several  other  buildings  (PECS  s.v.).  Although the  majority  of  the  remaining  buildings  at  Labraunda  were constructed  in  C 4  as  part  of  the  Hekatomnid  building  proj- ect,  there  was  activity  at  the  site  earlier,  as  evidenced  by Archaic  buildings  on  the  temple  terrace  (Westholm  ( 1963) 105)  and  by  sherds  dating  to  the  Protogeometric  period  and 1128 flensted-jensen onwards  (Jully  ( 1981)).  In  the  area  surrounding  the  sanctu- ary  there  are  several  forts,  which  may  have  been  part  of  a defence  system  and  which  probably  date  to Hekatomnid period  (Westholm  ( 1963)  13\u00ad15).The  acropolis  at  Labraunda is  also  of  Hekatomnid  date  (ibid. 15\u00ad19). Strabo  says  that  Mylasa  used  to  be  a  kome,  and  on  the  basis of  this,  Radt  assumes  that  Mylasa  was  not  a  conurbation  in the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  but  that  it  consisted  of \"einzelne  Flecken  und  Geh\u00f6fte\",  comparing  it  with  the  set- tlement  pattern  of  the  Halikarnassian  peninsula  before  the Mausolan  synoecism  (Radt  ( 1969\u00ad70)  167).  However, Rumscheid  argues  that  Mylasa  probably  existed  already  by C 7f((1995)  77\u00ad78,(1999)  206).  In  Arist.  Oec. 1348a12\u00ad13 Mylasa  is  described  as  ateichistos  in  the  360s.  Accepting  the account  as  historical,  Rumscheid  argues  that  Mylasa  did  not have  a  city  wall,  but  that  it  was  protected  by  a  number  of  for- tifications in the t erritory  (Rumscheid  ( 1999)  with  fig. 3).  A palaistra  and  a  gymnasion  are  mentioned  in  an  inscription of  c. 317  (I.Mylasa 21.9,  12). It  is  generally  stated  that  Mylasa  did  not  strike  coins  until C 3l  (Akarca  ( 1959)  11;Head,  HN \u00b2622),  except  for  the  bronze coins  struck  by  the  dynast  Eupolemos  in  his  own  name  at the  time  of  Alexander  or  a  little  later.  Obv.  three  Makedonian shields;  rev.  sword  in  sheath;  legend:  (HN \u00b2622).  However,  Hurter  describes  two  Mylasian tetradrachms  in  the  so-called  Pixodaros  hoard,  which  was deposited  c. 330  (Hurter  ( 1998)  147\u00ad50).  These  two  coins have  obv.  Zeus  Labraundios,  rev.  Zeus  Osogos  (a  combina- tion  of  Zeus  and  Poseidon)  holding  a  trident  and  an  eagle. 914. ", "Olymos": "Identifier: 920. , (Hylimeus) Map  61.

There  are  practically  no  archaeological  remains  left  at  the site  of  Olymos,  but  a  large  number  of  Hellenistic  inscrip- tions  bearing  the  toponym  and  the  ethnic  make  the  site identification c ertain  (I.Mylasa ii  pp. 29ff;  Bean  ( 1971)  48). 920.

The  C 4l  fortification wall on the acropolis is in polygonal masonry  (PECS  s.v.).  The  city  wall  is  built  in  different  types of  masonry:  pseudo-isodomic,  regular  polygonal  and  crude polygonal  tending  to  ashlar.  Pimouguet  argues  that  it  seems reasonable  to  conclude  that  the  wall  was  built  in  the  course of  C 4  and  strengthened  or  repaired  later  (Pimouguet  ( 1994) 249\u00ad51).  The  C 4  date  is  supported  by Saner  ( 1994),  who  also mentions  five t owers  in  a  400  m  stretch  of  the  wall.  Only  the northern  and  western  parts  of  the  wall  are  preserved,  but  the enclosed  area  must  have  been  over  10  ha. 873.  (Amynandeis) Map 61.  Lat. 37.00,long.  27.40.

Amyzon  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Karian  district  and  is  recorded  (as  ;see Hornblower ( 1982)  278;  cf.  Robert  and  Robert  ( 1983)  36) from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.vi.6)  to  440/39  (IG i\u00b3  272.i.84)  a  total  of eleven  times,  five  times  completely  restored,  paying  1,500  dr. (IG i\u00b3  261.i.5). In a  honorary  decree  of 321/0  the  month  name (a  hapax)  occurs  (Robert  and  Robert  ( 1983) no. 2.2),  which  indicates  the  existence  of  a  local  calendar which  was  later  replaced  by  an  Ionian  calendar,  although Macedonian  month  names  are  also  attested  (Tr\u00fcmpy, Monat. 277\u00ad78). At  the  site  of  Amyzon  there  are  remains  of  fortification walls  in  ashlar  masonry,  probably  dating  to  C 4  (Marchese ( 1986)  105).  Moreover,  on  two  large  terraced  areas,  enclosed by  walls,  are  preserved  the  remains  of  a  Doric  temple  dedi- cated  to  Apollo  and  Artemis  with  C 6  terracottas.  A  temple  of Artemis  is  mentioned  in  an  inscription  of 321/0  (Robert  and Robert ( 1983)  no. 2).  Most  of  the  other  buildings  date  to  C 4. One  of  the  terraces  was  entered  through  a  propylon  dedicat- ed  by  Idrieus  in  C 4m  (OGIS 235;  Marchese  ( 1986)  107 ", "Euromos": "Identifier: 886. , (Euromeus) Map 61.

The  individual  city- ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  a  C 5f  proxeny  decree  (SEG 36 982.B4). Euromos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.

It  was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4,  once  in  a  syntelic  group with  the  Edrieis  (no. 892)  and  the  Hymisseis  (no. 890),  the whole  group  assessed  at  6  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.144),and  once  indi- vidually,  assessed  at  5  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.100). In C 5f  Arlissis,  son  of  Idyssolos,  from  Euromos  was  grant- ed  proxeny  by Iasos  (no. 891).  He  was  also  granted  enktesis ges  kai  oikion,  asylia,  proedria  and  dikai  (SEG 36  982.B4). The  town  was  situated  on  flat g round.

Halikarnassos  is called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  by  Hdt. 1.144.3  and  in  a  C 4l honorary  decree  (Michel  452.4),and  in  the  urban  sense  in  an inscription  of  c. 400  (SEG 43  713.33,  37,  45).  The  individual ethnic  is  attested  externally  on  a  gravestone  from  Miletos (I.Milet. vi.2407m  (C 5)).  The  collective city-ethnic  is  attest- ed  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  265.i.10),and internally  on  coins  (SNG  Cop.  Caria 336\u00ad37). Halikarnassos  was  a  Dorian  city,  allegedly  colonised  by Troizen  (no. 357)  (Hdt. 7.99.3;  cf.  Paus. 2.30.9,  32.6;Strabo 14.2.16).  On  the  connections  between  Halikarnassos  and Troizen,  see  Jameson  ( 2004).  Halikarnassos  was  one  of  the Greek poleis  to  build  the  Hellenion  in  Naukratis  (no. 1023) (Hdt. 2.178.2). Halikarnassos  was  the  capital  of  a  dynasty  which  Hdt. 7.99.1  describes  as  a  tyranny.  The  first t yrant  was  Lygdamis, succeeded  by  his  daughter  Artemisia  (Hdt. 7.99.1\u00ad2;  Suda 536).  During  Xerxes'  invasion  of  Greece  she  was  the  com- mander  of  five ships from H alikarnassos,  Kos  (no. 499), Nisyros  (no. 508)  and  Kalydna  (no. 485)  (Hdt. 7.99.2).  Later in  C 5f  Halikarnassos  was  ruled  by  another  Lygdamis.  In C 5m  a  faction  joined  by  Herodotos  was  exiled  after  an abortive  attempt  to  overthrow  Lygdamis  (Suda 536). Halikarnassos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It belonged  to  the  Karian  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.13)  to  429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.iv.15)  a total  of  sixteen  times,  twice  completely  restored,  paying  in most  years  a  phoros  of 1  tal., 4,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.12\u00ad13),but in 447/6  a  phoros  of 2  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  265.i.10)  and  in  441/0  a  phoros of 1  tal., 4,840  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  271.i.78).  It was  assesed  for  tribute  in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.144). C. 370  Mausolos  moved  the  capital  of  the  dynasty  from Mylasa  (no. 913)  to  Halikarnassos  and  enlarged  the  city  by synoecising  some  smaller  settlements  into  it  (Plin.  HN 5.107; Hornblower ( 1982)  82;  Demand  ( 1990)  123;  supra 1108).  The city  seems  now  to  have  been  laid  out  on  a  Hippodamian  grid plan  (Hoepfner  and  Schwandner  ( 1994)  227). A  law  of  C 5f  mentions  a     as  the  venue  of  the syllogos  of  the  Halikarnassians  and  the  Salmakians  (no. 929) (Syll. \u00b345.3  ML 32).  The  law  (called  both  ( 19),  and \u00b5  ( 32))  was  passed  by  the  syllogos  and  the  tyrant Lygdamis  and  concerns  property disputes.  A  number  of magistrates  are  mentioned:  prytanis  ( 5\u00ad6),  mnemones  ( 8) and  dikastai  ( 20).  A  keryx  from  Halikarnassos  is  mentioned in  a  C 4  treaty  between  Mylasa  (no. 913)  and  Kindye  (no. 902) (SEG 40  991.16). Some  citizens  of  Halikarnassos  were  appointed  proxenoi by  the  Chians  (no. 840)  (PEP  Chios 50.4  (C 4m)).  In  410/9  a decree  was  passed  by  the  Athenians  in  honour  of  the Halikarnassian  polis  (restored)  as  euergetis  of  Athens  (IG i\u00b3 103).  In  C 4l  Zenodotos,  son  of  Baukis,  had  been  honoured by Troizen  (no. 357),  and  therefore  more  honours  were bestowed  upon  him  (Michel  452):  he  was  invited  to  the  pry- taneion  at  Halikarnassos  (l. 11;  cf.  Miller  ( 1978)  no. 323).  This measure  (psephisma,l. 13)  is  decided  by  the  demos  (l. 12), after  having  been  deliberated  by  the  boule  (l. 15).  In  392 Phormion  of  Halikarnassos  won  a  victory  at  Olympia (Olympionikai 378). Seven  month  names  are  attested.  They  constitute  a  mix- ture  of  Ionian  and  non-Ionian  names;  see  Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 113\u00ad14. The  city  wall  is  mentioned  in  a  C 5m  inscription  (Syll. \u00b3 46.15  ML 32).Under  Mausolos,  from  377/6  (Diod. 16.36.2), the  city  was  enlarged  by  the  inclusion  of  Salmakis  (no. 929) and  the  land  between  the  city  proper  and  Salmakis.  The  city wall  was  replaced  by  a  new  7  km  wall  which  encircled  the enlarged  city,  including  the  harbour;  it  enclosed  an  area  of c. 220  ha  (Jeppesen  ( 2000)  334).  The  wall  is  built  in  different types  of  masonry,  which  is  probably  due  to the  building materials,  rather  than  different  construction  periods.  It  had two  main  gates,  one  towards  Myndos,  the  other  towards Mylasa  (Arr.  Anab. 1.20.4\u00ad5),  of  which  only  the  Myndos  gate has  been  located  (Pedersen  ( 1994)).  Two  smaller  gates  have been  discovered,  one  on  the  southern  side  of  the  tower  on the  east,  the  other  in  connection  with  a  gate  complex  on  the north-eastern  extension.  This  gate  undoubtedly  gave  access to  Pedasa  to the  north  of  Halikarnassos  (Pedersen  ( 2000) 288).There  was  a  moat  in  front  of  the  wall  (Arr.  Anab. 1.20.8; Diod. 17.24.4).  Thirteen  towers  have  been  found,  all  in  dif- ferent  types  of  masonry  and  material,  but  the  drain  system and  the  general  coherence  indicate  that  the  wall  and  towers were  planned  and  constructed  at  one  time,  with  later  repairs karia  1115 (Pedersen  ( 2000)  288\u00ad91).On  the  hill  commanding  the  road to  Mylasa  is  a  free-standing  tower  built  in  large  boulders  in an  almost  \"cyclopean\"  fashion.  It  is  probably  contemporary with  the  city  wall  (ibid. 291). In  the  city  of  Halikarnassos  a  temple  of  Apollo  is  attested in  a  C 5f  inscription  (Syll. \u00b345.45  ML 32).  Fragments  of early  Classical  Ionic  columns  found  in  the  city  may  be  asso- ciated  with  this  temple.  The  few  architectural  remains  show that  the  temple  was  influenced b y  the  Polykrates  temple  in Samos  (Jeppesen  ( 2000)  333).Furthermore,the  remains  of  a temple  in  Ionic  style  are  generally  interpreted  as  the  temple of  Ares  mentioned  by Vitruvius  ( 2.8.11).  Ares  seems  to  have  been  the  principal  divinity  worshipped  by  the Halikarnassians  (Hornblower  ( 1982)  302).  The  excavated but  unpublished  theatre  is  sometimes  dated  to  C 3e,  but  may go  further  back. Diod. 15.90.3  (r 362)  says  that  Halikarnassos  had  a famous  acropolis  and  was  \"the  basileia  of  Karia\".  At the  time  of  Alexander,  he  describes  it  as  the  largest polis  in  Karia,  endowed  with  several  citadels  ( 17.23.4).  Diod. 17.25.5  mentions  the  walls  of  the  acropolis.  Alexander  took and  razed  the  city  in 334  (Diod. 17.27.6;Arr.  Anab. 1.20.2\u00ad23.6). In C 4  Halikarnassos  was  endowed  with  one  of  the  most famous  monuments  of  Antiquity:  the  tomb  of  Mausolos, the  Mausoleum,  or,  more  correctly,  the  Maussolleion,of which  very  little  is  left.  In  Antiquity,  it  ranked  among  the Seven  Wonders  of  the  World,  and  it  existed  until  the  fif- teenth  century,  when  it  was  destroyed  by  the  Knights  of Rhodes.  Work  on  it  was  begun  in  367,  and  it  was  finished after  the  death  of  Mausolos'  wife  Artemisia  in  351.The  archi- tect  was  Pythios  of  Priene  in  collaboration  with  another architect  named  Satyros.  The  famous  sculptors  Bryaxis, Leochares,  Timotheos  and  Skopas  were  involved  in  the work.  The  monument  consisted  of  three  parts:  thirty-six Ionic  columns  stood  on  a  very  tall  rectangular  base, 38.4 32  m.  Upon  the  columns  was  a  pyramidal  structure  with twenty-four  steps,  and  the  monument  was  crowned  with  a sculptured  group  imposed  on  a  platform.  The  building  was adorned  with  numerous  sculptures  and  friezes  (Lawrence ( 1996)  146\u00ad47;  Jeppesen  ( 1994)  with  refs.).  So  far  no  remains have  been  found  of  Mausolos'  palace,  built  on  the Zephyrion  promontory  east  of  the  harbour  and  mentioned at  Vitruvius  2.8.10;  cf.  Jeppesen  ( 2000)  338. According  to  Ps.-Skylax  99  Halikarnassos  had  an enclosed  harbour  and  one  \"by  the  island\".  Diod. 15.90.3 (r 363)  calls  Halikarnassos    \u00b5.  In  the C 5m  inscription  which  deals  with  purchase  and  sale  of  land and  houses  in  Halikarnassos,  a  number  of  districts  or  areas are  mentioned  (SEG 43  713). Halikarnassos  struck  coins  before  480,  silver  coins  on  the Rhodian  standard  in  400\u00ad367  (and  again  in  188\u00ad166).Staters are  mentioned  in  a  C 5flaw (Syll. \u00b345.40  ML 32).  There  are various  types,  and  the  legend  is  or abbreviations  thereof  (Head,  HN \u00b2  617\u00ad19;  SNG  Cop.  Caria 336\u00ad37). Halikarnassos  was  a  polis  with  a  mixed  population.  The names  listed  in  the  C 5m  inscription  concerning  confisca- tion  and  resale  of  property (SEG 43  713)  constitute  a  mixture of  Greek  and  Karian  names.  In  some  cases,  a  man  has  a Greek  name,  but  his  father  a  Karian  (  ,l.  10,or \u00b5 ,ll.  169\u00ad70),  or even  vice  versa  (  \u00b5,l.  50).  Two  of  the Halikarnassians  mentioned  in  the  C 4  treaty  between  Kindye and  Mylasa  have  Karian  names  (SEG 40  991.15\u00ad16).  There  is no  doubt  that  there  was  a  strong  Karian  element  in  the population  in  the  Classical  period. 887.

The  Kyblisseis  were  members  of  the  Delian  League,  but they  are  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  only  once,  in  451/0  (IG i\u00b3 262.v.26),  paying  a  phoros  of 1,000  dr.  In  the  list  of 453/2  (IG i\u00b3  260.i.7)  the  city-ethnic  is  completely  restored.  They  are absent  from  the  full  panel  of 441/0  (IG i\u00b3  271.i\u00adii.63\u00ad86),  but were  probably  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.108: [h ][~]) a minimum of  2,000  dr. A  keryx  from  the  Kyblisseis  is  mentioned  in  the  C 4m treaty  between  Mylasa  and  Kindye  (SEG 40  991.9).  The names  listed  in  this  inscription  ( 8\u00ad9)  suggest  that  there  was a  strong  Karian  element  in  the  population  of  this  communi- ty  (Bl\u00fcmel  ( 1990)  38\u00ad42  (  SEG 40  992)),  and  it  is  a  moot point  to  what  extent  the  Kyblisseis  can  be  considered  a Hellenic  polis  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods. 888.

In  the  treaty  with  Latmos, 100 Pidasian  citizens,  selected  by  the  Latmioi,  are  to  swear  to  the treaty ( 29).

In  the  assess- ment  decree  of 410/9  the  ethnic  is  almost  completely restored  (IG i\u00b3  100.ii.8).

However,  in  C 5f  the Salmakians  were  clearly  some  kind  of  political  community, passing  a  law  with  the  Halikarnassians  and  the  tyrant Lygdamis.

In  a  treaty  with Eupolemos  of  c. 310  (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 429)  Theangela  is  called  a polis  both  in  the  urban  sense  ( 20)  and  in  the  political  sense ( 24).

The  original  centre  of  the  polis  was  at Syangela.  In,  perhaps,  C 6m  the  centre  was  moved  to  the other  site,  but  the  name  was  kept.  It  was  probably  Mausolos who  had  the  polis  renamed  Theangela,  but  for  half  a  century the  old  toponym  and  city-ethnic  were  used  alongside  the new  ones  (Radt  ( 1970);  Hornblower  ( 1982)  97\u00ad99;  Franke ( 1984);  Bl\u00fcmel  ( 1990)  37).  At  the  site  of  Theangela  there  are remains  of  a  perimeter  c. 3  km  long,  with  a  rectangular  fort with  four  towers,  in  different  types  of  masonry;  the  wall encloses  an  area  of 25  ha  (Bean  and  Cook  ( 1955)  112\u00ad16, ( 1957)  89\u00ad96).

Syangela  was  possibly  assessed  for  tribute  in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.111,  completely  restored).  In  454/3  Syangela is  represented  by  Pikres  Syangeleus,  who  appears  again  in 427/6  as ~       ,  and  this  shows  that Syangela  was  ruled  by  a  local  dynast. Like  Myndos  (no. 914),  Syangela  (renamed  Theangela) was  kept  out  of  the  synoecism  of  Halikarnassos  by  Mausolos c. 370  (Kallisthenes  (FGrHist 124)  fr. 25,  pace  Plin.

Some  coins  inscribed  with  and  formerly  attributed  to Syros  (no. 523)  and  Syme  (no. 522)  respectively  were in  all probability  struck  by  Syangela.

The  individual  and  external  use  is  attested  in  a  decree  from Iasos  (I.Iasos 45.5  (C 4\u00adC3)). Kaunos  was  taken  by  Harpagos  in  C 6  (Hdt. 1.176.3). Around 497  it  participated  in  the  Ionian  Revolt  (Hdt. 5.103.2). Kaunos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Karian  district  and  is  registered  in  the  tribute  lists from  453/2  (IG i\u00b3  260.vii.8)  to  421/0  (IG i\u00b3  285.ii.11)  a  total  of fourteen  times,  three  times  completely  restored,  paying  a phoros  of 3,000  dr.  in  all  years.

Hornblower ( 1982)  28  n. 176).  The  tribute  lists  show  that Kaunos  was  back  in  the  League  by  421/0,  but  it  seceded  from Athens  once  again  in  412/11  (Thuc. 8.39.3\u00ad4,  41.1,  42.2,  57.1). In 397/6  Konon  had  his  headquarters  at  Kaunos  (Hell.

In  C 4l\u00adC3e  a  citizen  of  Kaunos  was  grant- ed  proxenia  by  Iasos  (no. 891)  (I.Iasos 45). Kaunos  had  a  harbour  (Ps.-Skylax  99: \u00b5 ), and  Diod. 20.27.2  refers  to  two  citadels  in  309,  one  with  a Herakleion,  the  other  with  a  Persikon.

Investigations  of  the  fortifica- tions  seem  to  show  that  a  major  expansion  took  place  in  the Hekatomnid  period  (ibid.).  Remains  of  city  walls  in  various styles  of  masonry  date  from  the  Hellenistic  period,  although some  parts  of  the  wall  may  be  dated  to  C 4.  The  walls  enclose an  area  of  c. 190  ha  (Bean  ( 1953);  Hornblower  ( 1982)  315\u00ad16; McNicoll ( 1997)  192\u00ad99).  Diod. 14.79.4  mentions  that Kaunos  was  besieged  by  the  Spartan  nauarchos  Pharax  in 1120 flensted-jensen 396,  so  the  city  must  have  been  walled  by  then.  The  earliest finds at K aunos  go  back  to  c. 700  (Gates  ( 1994)  266). According  to  some  numismatic  publications,  Kaunos struck  silver  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard  in  C 6,  and bronze  coins  from  C 4m  (Head,  HN \u00b2  612\u00ad13;  SNG  Cop.  Caria 179\u00ad83);  but  recently  a  group  of  C 5  silver  coins  have  been attributed  to  Kaunos  (Troxell  ( 1979);  Meier-Br\u00fcgge  ( 1998); Konuk  ( 1998)).  Some  of  the  coins  belonging  to  this  group bear  a  legend  in  Karian  script,  and  thanks  to  the  decipher- ment  of  the  recently  found  bilingual  inscription  from Kaunos  (Frei  and  Marek  ( 1997)),  it  is  now  evident  that  the legend  is  the  name  of  Kaunos  in  Karian.  Incidentally,  the name  of  Kaunos  in  Karian  is  bid-,  and  the  ethnic  is bid\u00ea\u00f1ni (ibid.  23).  Thus  the  name  \"Kaunos\"  is  not  a  tran- scription,  but  a  Greek  name.  The  types  of  the  Archaic  coins are  obv.  forepart  of  a  lion;  rev.  incuse  square  divided  into  two  oblong  halves.  The  C 5  coins  have  been  found  in  the  following  denominations:  staters,  drachms,  hemidrachms, tritartemoria,  trihemitartemoria.  Obv.  winged  Iris.  rev.rec- tangular  or  triangular  shape  in  an  incuse  square  or  griffin, sometimes  a  legend  in  Karian  script  (for  the  details  of  these coins,  see  Konuk  ( 1998)).  The  types  of  the  C 4  coins  are  obv. forepart  of  a  bull;  rev.  Sphinx  along  with  the  legend  . These  are  the  first K aunian  coins  with  Greek  legends  (see also  Konuk  ( 1998)  219). According  to  Hdt. 1.172.1,  the  Kaunians  were  indigenous Karian-speaking  people  who,  however,  believed  that  they had  come  from  Crete.  In  Ps.-Skylax  99  Kaunos  is  still  classi- fied as a K arian  polis.  Furthermore,  kerykes  from  Kaunos  are mentioned  in  the  treaty  between  Mylasa  (no. 913)  and Kindye  (no. 902)  (SEG 40  991.18\u00ad19);  the  names  listed  in  this inscription  as  well  as  the  bilingual  inscription  (supra)  sug- gest  that  there  was  still  a  strong  Karian  element  in  the  popu- lation  of  this  community  (Bl\u00fcmel  ( 1990)  38\u00ad42  (  SEG 40 991\u00ad92)).  Only  coins  of  C 4  have  legends  in  Greek,  and  it  is  a moot  point  to  what  extent  Kaunos  can  be  considered  a Hellenic  polis  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods. 899.Kedreai  (Kedreates) Map  61.

Kedreai  is  called  a  polis  mainly  in  the  urban,  but probably  also  in  the  political  sense  by  Xen.  Hell. 2.1.15.The collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  the Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  271.ii.76).

Kedreai  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Karian  district  and  is  registered  in  the  tribute  lists from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.v.17)  to  415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.i.20)  a  total  of sixteen  times,  once  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 3,000  dr.

Remains  of  an  early  Hellenistic  city  wall  at  Kedreai  have been  found,  generally  in  polygonal  masonry  (Bean  ( 1971) 54\u00ad55;  cf.  Anabolu  ( 1994)),  although  some  parts  are  in  rec- tangular  isodomic  masonry  (Pimouguet  ( 1994)  253\u00ad54). Furthermore,  there  are  scanty  remains  of  a  temple,  probably Archaic  (Bean  ( 1971)  55). Xenophon  states  that  Kedreai  was  a  mixed  settlement, \u00b5,in  405  (Xen.

Hell. 3.2.19  says  Tralleis  is  in  Karia,  whereas  Diod. 14.36.2  calls  it  a  polis  in  Ionia.

A  keryx  from  Ouranion  is  mentioned  in  a  C 4m  treaty (SEG 40  992.16). Ouranion  was  one  of  the  settlements  which  were  synoe- cised  into  Halikarnassos  (no. 886)  by  Mausolos  c. 370  (Plin. HN 5.107;  Hornblower  ( 1982)  82;  Demand  ( 1990)  123),  but  it seems  likely  that  the  place  still  functioned  as  a  manned stronghold  even  after  the  civilian  population  had  been moved  (Hornblower  ( 1982)  88). At  the  site  of  Ouranion  there  are  remains  of  a  fortification which  is  c. 50  m  long  and  enclosed  by  a  wall  built  in  coursed masonry.  The  fortifications have v ertical  drafting  at  the edges,  which  points  to  a  C 4  date  (Hornblower  ( 1982)  95). There  are  remains  of  an  outer  perimeter  in  polygonal masonry.

There  were  possibly  three  main gates  and  thirteen  tower  entrances  and  sally-ports (McNicoll  ( 1997)  160\u00ad64);  see  also  Dornisch  ( 1992)  144\u00ad51). There  were  four  grave  areas  around  the  city,  and  some  of  the graves  date  to  C 4s  (Spanu  ( 1997)  164\u00ad72). Keramos  is  generally  considered  Karian  in  origin  (PECS s.v.;  Spanu  ( 1997)  15).  The  name  of  the  phyle \u00b5  is clearly  Karian  (I.Keramos 3.12).  An  Archaic  kouros  has  been found  at  Keramos  (Richter  ( 1960)  111  no. 130),  as  well  as  the torso  of  another  (G\u00fcrmann  ( 1977)),  and  while  this  shows both  that  Keramos  existed  as  early  as  C 6  and  that  there  was some  contact  to  the  Greek  world  by  C 6,  it  does  not  of  course show  that  Keramos  was  in  any  way  Hellenised.  The  names  of the  Keramioi  listed  in  the  C 4m  treaty  between  Mylasa  and Kindye  (SEG 40  992)  suggest  that  there  was  a  strong  Karian element  in  the  Keramian  population,  and  it  is  a  moot  point to  what  extent  the  community  can  be  considered  a  Hellenic polis  even  in  the  Classical  period. Until  recently  it  was  believed  that  Keramos  struck  coins only  from  C 2;  but  recently  an  isolated  C 4  issue  of  bronze coins  has  come  to  light.  The  coins  bear  the  legend  ,  and it  has  been  suggested  that  they  be  attributed  to  Keramos, although  nearby  Kedreai  (no. 899)  is  another  possibility.

In  a  C 4m  treaty between  Mylasa  (no. 913)  and  Kindye  (no. 902)  the  Killareis are  among  the  city-ethnics  listed  after  the  heading    ,  where polis  is  used  in  the  political  sense  (SEG 40  991.11).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  used  exter- nally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  262.v.28)  and  in  a C 4m  treaty  between  Mylasa  and  Kindye  (SEG 40  991.11). The  Killareis  were  members  of  the  Delian  League,  but they  are  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  only  once,  in  451/0  (IG i\u00b3 262.v.28),  paying  a  phoros  of 1,000  dr.  In  the  list  of 453/2  (IG i\u00b3  260.i.8)  the  city-ethnic  is  completely  restored.  Moreover, they  may  have  been  listed  in  the  tribute  assessment  decree  of 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.96\u00ad97),  where  we  find [ ][~  h ~] [---  ],  which  indicates  that  the  Killareis  were  ruled by  a  dynast  (Bean  and  Cook  ( 1957)  99\u00ad100).  The  Killareis were  assessed  at  2  tal. Around  C 4m  the  Killareis  passed  a  decree,  granting  hon- ours  to  Hyssollos,  son  of  Samoos  (I.Mylasa 961  L.  Robert ( 1950)  14  no. 11).  In  l. 1  the  word  ekklesia  occurs.  A  keryx  from the  Killareis  is  mentioned  in  the  C 4m  treaty  between  Mylasa and  Kindye  (SEG 40  991.12). The  remains  of  the  site  of  the  Killareis  consist  of  C 4  forti- fications.  There  is  an  outer  circuit  in  squared  masonry  with towers,  and  a  citadel  linked  to  the  outer  circuit  on  the  north- ern  side.  Inside  the  citadel  there  are  underground  galleries which  have  been  interpreted  as  cisterns  (Bean  and  Cook ( 1957)  99).  A  C 3m  inscription  mentions  a  harbour (although  the  site  of  the  Killareis  was  located  c. 10  km  inland (Bl\u00fcmel  ( 1992)  128  D 4  and  comm.  ad.  loc.;  cf.  SEG 42 994.D4). The  stone  which  carries  the  C 4  decree  of  the  Killareis  (see supra)  is  inscribed  in  Karian  as  well  (Deroy  ( 1955)  314), which  indicates  that  there  was  a  Karian  element  in  the  area at  the  time.  The  Karian  text  contains  the  city-ethnic,  but  not the  personal  names  of  the  Greek  text,  so  the  inscription  is not  a  bilingual  one  (Bl\u00fcmel  ( 1992)  128;  Bl\u00fcmel  and  Adiego ( 1993)).  Similarly,  the  names  listed  in  the  treaty  between Mylasa  and  Kindye  suggest  that  there  was  a  strong  Karian element  in  the  Killarian  population  (SEG 40  991.11\u00ad12;see Bl\u00fcmel  ( 1990)  38\u00ad42  (  SEG 40  991\u00ad92)),  and  it  is  a  moot point  to  what  extent  the  community  can  be  considered  a Hellenic  polis  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods. 902.

At  the  site  of  Kindye  there  are  remains  of  city  walls (approximately  450  200  m)  of  the  Classical  period,  with  a citadel  (c. 120  m)  built  in  dry  rubble  masonry,  in  places  tend- ing  to polygonal.

Kalynda  was  a  neighbour  of  Kaunos  (no. 898),  and  Hdt. 1.172.2  mentions  the  boundary  between  the  two  commun- ities.  It  was  probably  situated  c. 10  km  from  the  sea,  where there  are  the  remains  of  a  ring  wall  in  polygonal  masonry.

However,  at  that  time  it  was  no  longer  a  city-ethnic,  but  a sub-ethnic,  Karbasyanda  having  become  a  civic  subdivision of  Kaunos  (no. 898). Karbasyanda  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.

The  Karbasyandeis  were  neighbours  of  Kaunos  (IG i\u00b3 271.i.68\u00ad69),and  their  city  may  have  been  located  at  a  hill  1.6 km  south-west  of  Kaunos.  On  the  hill  there  are  remains  of  a 65  20  m  fort  in  isodomic  ashlar  masonry,  and  very  scanty remains  of  a  dry  rubble  wall  apparently  encirling  the  hill (Bean  ( 1953)  15,  21,  24). 896.

It was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.138). It  is  clear  from  Ps.-Skylax  that  in  C 4m  Karyanda  was  an island  with  a  polis  and  a  harbour.  Later,  and  probably  in  the early  Hellenistic  period,  the  population  moved  to  the  main- land  and  settled  near  a  lake  somewhere  between  Bargylia and  Myndos  (Strabo  14.2.20;  see  Bean  and  Cook  ( 1955) 155\u00ad60).

Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  142,  and  it  is  retrospec- tively  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  by  Arr.  Anab. 1.20.6 (r 334). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  Hellenistic  coins  (SNG  Cop.  Caria 439\u00ad43:  (C 2\u00adC1))  and  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3 271.ii.86).  For  the  individual  and  external  use,  see  Hdt. 5.33.3;  I.Knidos 23.9\u00ad10  (C 2). Hdt. 5.33.2  mentions  a  Myndian  ship  in  the  fleet of Aristagoras  c. 500.  Myndos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian League.  It  belonged  to  the  Karian  district  and  is  recorded  in the  tribute  lists  from  453/2  (IG i\u00b3  260.vi.16)  to  421/0  (IG i\u00b3 285.i.92\u00ad93)  a  total  of  nineteen  times,  four  times  completely restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 500  dr.,  except  in  421/0  when  it paid 1,000  dr.  It  was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3 71.ii.141),  1,000  dr.  Myndos  must  have  defected  from  Athens during  the  Dekeleian  War,  since  at  Delphi  the  statues  of those  who  fought  with  Lysander  at  Aigos  potamoi  in  405 included  one  of  Theopompos  of  Myndos  (Paus. 10.9.10).  In 334  Alexander  attacked  Myndos,  which,  however,  resisted his  assault  because  of  the  failure  of  a  secret  agreement between  Alexander  and  a  faction  behind  the  walls  (Arr. Anab. 1.20.5\u00ad7). Citing  the  C 4  historian  Kallisthenes  of  Olynthos,  Strabo says  that  when  Mausolos  synoecised  some  poleis  into Halikarnassos  (no. 886),  Myndos  was  left  as  it  was  (Strabo 13.1.59;  Callisthenes  (FGrHist 124)  fr. 25).  The  coastal  site  on the  tip  of  the  Halikarnassos  peninsula  does  not  go  further back  than  the  Mausolan  period,  so  \"old  Myndos\"  must  be sought  elsewhere  (cf.  the  distinction  between  Myndos  and Palaimyndos,  Plin.  HN 5.107;  Steph.  Byz. 462.4).  Bean  and Cook  identify  \"Lelegian\"  Myndos  with  a  site  not  far  from \"new  Myndos\".  It  is  generally  assumed  that  it  was  Mausolos who  initiated  the  move  (Hornblower  ( 1982)  97).  At  the  hill- top  site  of  \"old  Myndos\"  very  little  remains.  There  are  foun- dations  of  a  tower  in  irregular  masonry  and  a  ring  wall  in loose  polygonal  or  dry  rubble  masonry.  Sherds  seem  to  indi- cate  that  the  site  was  abandoned  in  C 4e  (Bean  and  Cook ( 1955)  118).  At the  site  of  \"new  Myndos\"  there  are  remains  of an  outer  circuit  in  ashlar  masonry,  which  must  have  been c. 3.5  km  long  and  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 45  ha.  We know  from Arr.  Anab. 1.20.6  that  Myndos  was  walled  in  334.  McNicoll suggests  that  the  walls  were  erected  after  367  and  before  334 (( 1997)  23).  Furthermore,  there  is  a  so-called  Lelegian  wall, which  is,  however,  too  recent  to  be  \"Lelegian\"  and  is  of  dif- ferent  masonry  (Hornblower  ( 1982)  305\u00ad6).  McNicoll  sug- gests  that  this  wall  was  built  after  334.  It  is  in  hammer-faced isodomic  ashlar,  whereas  the  tower  to  the  north-east  is  in isodomic  ashlar  masonry  with  headers  and  stretchers (McNicoll  ( 1997)  22\u00ad24).  Nothing  remains  of  the  founda- tions  of  temples  and  the  stadion  seen  by Newton  (( 1863) 575\u00ad77;  cf.  Bean  and  Cook  ( 1955)  108\u00ad12,  118,  145).  According to  Ps.-Skylax 99,  Myndos  had  a  harbour  (cf.  Strabo  14.2.20). 915.  (Narisbareis) Map 61.  Unlocated.  Type:  C:?  A  topo- nym  is  not  attested.

HN 5.131  describes Telandria  as  an  island  with  a  deserted  oppidum;but accord- ing  to  Quintus  Smyrnaeus  4.7\u00ad11,  the  city  of  Telandros  lay inland  on  the  bank  of  the  Glaukos  river  (Nif  \u00c7ay).  Following Philippson  ( 1910\u00ad13)  and  followed  by  Barr.,  ATL  i. 555  argues that  the  polis  of  Telandros  was  situated  on  the  island  of Telandria,  to  be  identified w ith  Tersane.  ATL  also  attaches the  reference  in  Steph.  Byz.  to  this  island  (almost  certainly incorrectly).  Heberdey  (Map  of  Lycia  in  TAM  I)  identifies the  island  of  Telandria  with  Avthoki,  where  there  is  a  ruined watch-tower  (Bean  ( 1978)  36  (date?),  and  the  polis  of Telandros  with  the  inland  site  of  Nif  K\u00f6y  (following Arkwright  ( 1895)  94).

The  earliest  possible  attestation of  the  city-ethnic  `  is  on  a  Panathenaic amphora  of  C 4m  (infra);  the  earliest  unquestionable  attesta- tion  is  in  I.Priene 51.1  (C 2s).Latmos/Herakleia  is  called  a  polis both  in  the  urban  sense  (EA 29  ( 1997)  137.27\u00ad28;  Ps.-Skylax 99:  polis  Hellenis)  and  in  the  political  sense  (EA 29  ( 1997) 137.3,  16\u00ad17,  18).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic ( \u00b5) is attested internally in the treaty with Pidasa (EA 29  ( 1997)  137.14  (C 4l))  and  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute lists  (IG i\u00b3  260.x.3)  and  in  a  C 4m  treaty  between  Mylasa  (no. 913)  and  Kindye  (no. 902)  (SEG 40  992.11  (C 4m)). Three  \"Lelegian\"  ring  walls  have  been  located  in  the  terri- tory  of  Latmos,  two  on  Mt.  Latmos  and  one  on  the  southern bank  of  the  Bafa  Lake.  They  are  all  built  in  dry  rubble masonry,  and  since  there  are  no  remains  of  buildings  inside the  perimeter,  it  is  assumed  that  they  were  Fluchtburge (Peschlow-Bindokat  ( 1996)  22\u00ad23). Latmos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Karian  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from 453/2  (IG i\u00b3  260.x.3)  to  432/1  (IG i\u00b3  280.i.64)  a  total  of  four- teen  times,  twice  completely  restored,  paying  a  phoros  of 1 tal.  (IG i\u00b3  261.ii.29). 1126 flensted-jensen The  outstanding  source  for  C 4  Latmos  is  the  treaty  with Pidasa  (EA 29  ( 1997)  137)  about  a  physical  and  political amalgamation  of  the  two  poleis.  The  treaty  was  concluded  in the  period  323\u00ad313,  but  some  of  its  information  can  be  inter- preted  retrospectively  to  shed  light  on  the  social  and  politi- cal  organisation  of  Latmos  in  the  late  Classical  period:  an agora  ( 31\u00ad32)  and  a  temple  of  Athena  ( 35\u00ad36)  are  men- tioned,  and  in  the  town  of  Latmos  there  is  a  publicly  owned open  space  (demosie)  where  the  Pidaseis  can  build  their  new houses  ( 27\u00ad29).  The  oath  is  to  be  taken  by  200  Latmioi  ( 30), and  the  citizens  were  organised  into  an  unknown  number  of phylai  and  phratriai  ( 6\u00ad13;  cf.  Jones  ( 1999)).  A  board  of  tim- ouchoi  are  to  make  a  sacrifice in order t o  ensure  the homonoia  of  the  polis  ( 2\u00ad4). Latmos  was  abandoned  in  C 4  and  refounded  under  the name  Herakleia.  The  date  of  the  move  is  uncertain:  Ps- Skylax  mentions  Herakleia  ( 99),  but  not  Latmos,  and  since no  chapter  of  the  Periplous  is  likely  to  be  dated  later  than c. 330  (Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  137\u00ad38),it  must  be presumed  that  Herakleia  existed  already  by  then. Hornblower's  suggestion  (( 1982)  320)  that  the  move  was  ini- tiated  by  Mausolos  squares  with  Ps.-Skylax'  account  and with  some  fragments  of  a  C 4m  Panathenaic  amphora  found at  Labraunda  and  inscribed  `.  Hellstr\u00f6m argues  that  the  ethnic  must  be  interpreted  as  referring  to Herakleia  under  Latmos  (Hellstr\u00f6m  ( 1965)  8).  If  so,  it  sug- gests  that  a  citizen  of  Herakleia  participated  in  the Panathenaic  Games  in  C 4m.  However,  both  the  toponym Latmos  and  the  city-ethnic  Latmios  are  attested  in  the  treaty between  Latmos  and  Pidasa  concluded  in  the  period  323\u00ad313 (EA 29  ( 1997),supra).The  presumption  is  that,  for  a  relative- ly  short  period  of  time,  the  two  places  existed  simultaneous- ly  (already  suggested  by  Hornblower)  and  that  both city-ethnics  could  be  used  to  designate  a  citizen  of  this  com- munity.  The  two  sites  are  situated  less  than  1  km  from  each other  (Peschlow-Bindokat  ( 1996)  23,Abb.  23). Latmos  was  unfortified until C 4e,  when  the  city  wall  was built  and  at  the  same  time  the  city  was  enlarged.  The  city wall  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 90  ha;  it  had  fourteen  towers,  and two  gates  can  be  seen  today.  The  city  wall  and  the  buildings erected  at  the  same  time  as  the  wall  are  built  in  the  same building  technique:  isodomic  ashlar,  headers  and  stretchers (Peschlow  ( 1994)  155).  There  is  not  much  left  of  Latmos, since  building  material  was  to  a  large  extent  employed  in  the building  of  Herakleia.At Latmos  remains  of 100  houses  have been  revealed.  They  are  of  various  sizes, 20\u00ad100  m \u00b2,  and almost  invariably  of  quadrangular  plan.  In  the  centre  of  the city  an  agora  has  been  identified (mentioned in EA 29  ( 1997) 31\u00ad32).Sherds  found  at  Latmos  date  from  C 6\u00adC5  (Peschlow- Bindokat  ( 1996)  23\u00ad27). The  names  of  the  Latmians  listed  in  the  treaty  between Mylasa  (no. 913)  and  Kindye  (no. 902)(SEG  40  992.11)  sug- gest  that  there  was  a  strong  Karian  element  in  the  popula- tion  of  Latmos  (Bl\u00fcmel  ( 1990)  38\u00ad42  (  SEG 40  991\u00ad92)). 911.

The  city-ethnic  is  (I.Knidos 501.2  (C 6l);  IG i\u00b3  261.iv.8).Knidos  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the urban  sense  (Thuc. 8.35.3;  Ps.-Skylax 99:  polis  Hellenis)  and in  the  political  sense  (I.Knidos 5.4,  603.12;  SEG 44  901  (C 4f); Hdt. 1.144.3,  2.178.2).  The  word politai  occurs  in  a  C 6l  epi- gram  (I.Knidos 501.1).  Knidos  is  called  patris  on  a  C 4  grave inscription  (I.Knidos 625).  The  collective use  of  the  city-eth- nic  is  attested  internally  in  C 4  proxeny  decrees  (I.Knidos 1.7, 5.1,  603.6)  and  on  coins  (infra),  and  externally  in  the Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  261.iv.8)  and  in  literary  sources (Thuc. 3.88.2).  For  the  individual  and  external  use,  see C 4\u00adC3  gravestones  from  Attika  (IG ii\u00b2  9039\u00ad43)  and  the Eleusinian  accounts  of 329/8  (IG ii\u00b2  1672.191). The  site  of  the  city  of  Knidos  has  been  a  matter  of  great dispute.  Bean  and  Cook  have  argued  that  the  political  centre of  Knidos  was  at  one  point  moved  from  a  site  on  the  south coast  of  the  Knidian  peninsula  to  the  tip  of  the  peninsula ( 1952).  No  ancient  source  mentions  such  a  move,  and  the argument  was  based  solely  on  the  fact  that  no  archaeological remains  at  Tekir  seem  to  antedate  C 4.  The  suggestion  was followed  notably  by  Robert  and  Robert  (BE  ( 1954)  168)  and Hornblower (( 1982)  101),and  recently  by  Bresson  ( 1999)  and Berges  (( 1994),  ( 2000)).  Since  the  publication  of  Bean  and Cook's  article,  excavations  at  Tekir  have  revealed  remains that  do  go  further  back  than  C 4  and  that,  along  with  the  fact that  no  ancient  source  mentions  a  relocation  have  led  others to  argue  that  Knidos  was  located  at  Tekir  from  the  outset (Love  ( 1972);  Demand  ( 1989);  Bl\u00fcmel  ( 1991)  131\u00ad32).The  lat- est  suggestion,  that  of  Bresson,  is  that  that  while  there  can  be no  doubt  that  there  were  two  urban  centres  on  the  peninsu- la,  the  political  centre  was  at  Burgaz  until  C 4l,  when  it  was moved  to  Tekir. The  name  of  the  territory of  Knidos  was  (Hdt. 1.174.2;  Thuc. 8.35.2).  The  find of  a  C 6  inscription  in  the Knidian  alphabet  (  I.Rhod.Per. 351)  on  the  Loryma  penin- sula,  supports,  according  to  Bl\u00fcmel,  Cook's  suggestion  that the  Loryma  peninsula  was  part  of  Knidian  territory  at  the time,  or  at  least  an  \"Einflussgebiet\"  (Cook  ( 1961a)  60; Bl\u00fcmel  ( 1991);  pace  Held  ( 1996)  166\u00ad67,  who  argues  that  it was  independent  of  Knidos  and  Rhodos  (no. 1000)  before C 4).  Ps.-Skylax  99  indicates  that  in  C 4s  some  of  the  hinter- land  of  Knidos  was  dominated  by  Rhodos. According  to  Hdt. 1.174.2,  the  Knidians  were  colonists from  Lakedaimon  (no. 345)  (cf.  Malkin  ( 1994)  81;  Cartledge ( 2002)  93\u00ad94),  whereas  Strabo  14.2.6  says  that  they  came from  Megara  (no. 225).Knidos  was  one  of  the  original  mem- bers  of  the  Dorian  hexapolis,  and  the  common  Dorian  sanc- tuary  at  Triopion  was  probably  situated  on  Knidian territory (infra).  In  C 6e  Knidos  was  one  of  the  Dorian  poleis behind  the  Hellenion  at  Naukratis  (no. 1023)  (Hdt. 2.178.2). Knidos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Karian  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from 452/1  (IG i\u00b3  261.iv.8)  to  427/6  or 426/5  (IG i\u00b3  284.13)  a  total  of thirteen  times,  four  times  completely  restored,  paying  a phoros  of 3  tal.  in  452/1  (IG i\u00b3  261.iv.8),  5  tal.  from  450/49  IG i\u00b3  263.i.4),  again  3  tal.  from  444/3  (IG i\u00b3  268.iv.19),  and  2  tal. from  428/7  (IG i\u00b3  283.iii.20).  It was  assessed  for  tribute  in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.134).  In  412  Knidos  revolted  against  Athens at  the  instigation  of  Tissaphernes  (Thuc. 8.35;  cf.  Debord ( 1999)  219  with  n. 127),  and  at  Delphi  the  statues  of  those who  fought  with  Lysander  at  Aigos  potamoi  in  405  included karia  1123 one  of  Theodamos  of  Knidos  (Paus. 10.9.9).  Knidos  was  a member  of  a  symmachia  attested  exclusively  by  the  so-called coinage  (whose  legend  abbreviates  synmachon,  syn- machikon  or  synmachia  vel  sim.)  dating  to  C 5l\u00adC4e;  the other  poleis  striking  coins  were  Byzantion  (no. 674), Ephesos  (no. 844),  Iasos  (no. 891),  Kyzikos  (no. 747), Lampsakos  (no. 748),  Rhodos  (no. 1000)  and  Samos  (no. 864)  (Karwiese  ( 1980);  Debord  ( 1999)  273\u00ad77). Aristotle  twice  refers  to  the  Knidian  constitution:  at  Pol. 1305b12  he  states  that  the  oligarchy  at  Knidos  was  over- thrown  by  the  demos,  because  hoi  gnorimoi  were  split  into two  factions;  at  Pol. 1306b5  he  refers  once  again  to  the  citizens overthrowing  a  despotic  oligarchy  at  Knidos.  Some  have taken  these  passages  to refer  to two  different  revolutions,  the first A rchaic,  the  second  perhaps  C 4  (Hornblower  ( 1982) 117).A  preferable  view  seems  to  be  that  they  both  refer  to  the same  revolution  (Gehrke,  Stasis 79;  Robinson  ( 1997)  101\u00ad3) which,  however,  cannot  be  dated. Oligarchic  Knidos  was  ruled  by  a  council  of  sixty amnemones  appointed  for  life  from  among  the  aristoi  and acting  as  probouloi  (Plut.  Mor. 292A\u00adB).  The  attestation  of probouloi  seems  to  match  the  observation  by  Rhodes,  DGS 330:  that  any  mention  of  a  boule  involved  in  the  decision- making  process  is  of  the  Roman  period.  The  preserved  C 4 decrees  are  proposed  by  a  board  of  prostatai  and  carried  by \"the  Knidians\":  [  ] \u00b5 [ ]  (I.Knidos 603.1\u00ad3  (C 4f)).  Of  two  C 4  Knidian  dedications  in Delphi,  the  older  has  (Syll. \u00b3140  (shortly  after  386)), the  other  \u00b5  (Syll. \u00b3290  (c. 332)).  Hornblower ( 1982)  116  infers  that  an  oligarchy  of  C 4f  was  replaced  by  a democracy  in  the  age  of  Alexander.  From  c. 300  the  coins  of Knidos  have  on  the  obv.  the  head  of  Demokratia  with  the legend (Head,  HN \u00b2  616;  SNG  Cop.  Caria 305). A  tradition  going  back  to  Hermippos  (fr. 16,  Wehrli) reports  that  Eudoxos  of  Knidos  (c. 408\u00ad355)  legislated  for  his home  town of  Knidos  (Diog.  Laert. 8.88;Plut.  Mor. 1126B). Combining  these  sources,  Hornblower  ( 1982)  117\u00ad18  sug- gests  that  the  C 4f  oligarchy  was  introduced  by  Eudoxos  in concert  with  Mausolos,  but  was  replaced  by  a  democracy  in consequence  of  Alexander's  conquest  of  Asia  Minor. Some  prostatai  of  Knidos  are  mentioned  in  a  C 4s  lex  sacra (I.Knidos 160.2)  and  in  a  C 4f  proxeny  decree  (I.Knidos 603.2\u00ad3;  cf.  I.Knidos 604.1).  A  citizen  of  Knidos  was  awarded proxenia  by  the  Karthaians  (no. 492)  (IG xii.5542.26 (C 4m)).  Envoys  from  Knidos  are  mentioned  by  Diod. 20.95.4  (r 304).  In  C 4f  the  Knidioi  granted  Dionysios  of Miletos  (no. 854)  proxeny  (I.Knidos 1),  about  the  same  time proxeny  was  granted  to Amphares  of  Athens  (no. 361) (I.Knidos 5),and  c. 363  the  Knidioi  granted  Epameinondas  of Thebes  (no. 221)  proxeny  (Bl\u00fcmel  ( 1994)  157\u00ad58;  on  the  sig- nificance of  this  decree,  see  Buckler  ( 1998),  ( 2000)  439). A  number  of  cults  are  attested  at  Knidos.  According  to Paus. 1.1.3  (r 394  and  earlier)  the  Knidioi  worshipped Aphrodite,  and  they  had  three  temples  dedicated  to  her,  one for  Aphrodite  Doritis  (the  oldest),  one  for  Aphrodite  Akraia, and  one  for  the  Aphrodite  called  Knidia  by  most  Greeks,  and Euploia  by  the  Knidioi.  There  was  a  cult  of  Demeter  and Kore  at  Knidos,  as  attested  in  a  dedicatory  epigram  of  C 4l (I.Knidos 131;  cf.  I.Knidos 132),  and  cult  of  the  Dioskouroi  is attested  in  a  C 6f  dedication  (I.Knidos 601).Games  in  honour of  Apollon  Triopios  were  held  there  (Hdt. 1.144). The  Knidian  peninsula  was  also  the  site  of  the  sanctuary of  the  Dorian  hexapolis  at  Triopion  with  a  temple  of  Apollo (Thuc. 8.35.2;Diod.  5.61.2).  The  exact  site  of  Triopion  has also  been  the  subject  of  debate:  most  scholars  assume  that  it was  located  at  Tekir,  whereas  Berges  argues  that  the  sanctu- ary  of  Triopion  was  situated  at  an  extensive  (c. 100  80  m) terraced  site  c. 15  km  east  of  Burgaz.  The  site  has  not  been thoroughly  excavated  (yet),  but  the  remains  of  walls  and (inter  alia)  a  graffito w ith  a  hieros  gamos  scene  clearly  point to  an  Archaic  (C 7l\u00adC6e)  foundation  date.  There  are  remains of  a  small  temple  of  the  Hellenistic  period,  and  some  very large  Doric  drums  which  might  be  the  remains  of  a  temple of  considerable  dimensions  (Berges  ( 1995\u00ad96)  esp. 114\u00ad19; cf.  Berges  and  Tuna  ( 1990)).  While  it  seems  certain  that  the place  was  a  sanctuary,  it  is  too  early  to  tell  whether  it  was  the Triopion. At  modern  Tekir  there  are  remains  of  a  stoa,  built  in  two phases,  of  which  the  earliest  is  C 4s  in  isodomic  masonry  (for this  stoa,  see  Love ( 1972)  63\u00ad64).  The  Propylon  which  leads to  the  sanctuary  of  Apollo  may  date  to  c. 300  (Bankel  ( 1997) 68).  A  temple  of  Dionysos  mentioned  in  a  lex  sacra  of  C 4s (I.Knidos 160  LSAM 55). At  modern  Tekir  there  are  remains  of  acropolis  walls,  the earliest  parts  of  which  date  from  C 4m  and  are  built  in pseudo-isodomic  and  isodomic  ashlar  masonry  (AR ( 1999));  they  enclose  an  area  of 20  ha  (Bean  ( 1971)  149).  It  is assumed  that  the  habitation  area  was  located  on  the  small island  which  is  now  connected  with  the  peninsula  by  a  nar- row  isthmus,  while  the  public  buildings  were  located  on  the peninsula.  No  remains  of  the  habitation  area--assumed  to have  had  a  Hippodamian  layout--have  been  found,  where- as  there  are  rich  finds  from  the  peninsula  site.  The  majority of  the  remains,  such  as  the  theatre  and  the  bouleuterion,are late. 1124 flensted-jensen According  to  Thuc. 8.35.3,  Knidos  did  not  have  city  walls in 412.  At  modern  Burgaz  there  are  remains  of  C 5l  fortifica- tion  walls  built  in  ashlar  masonry  (AR  ( 1999);  Gates  ( 1995) 236,(1997)  282).  Berges  argues  that  these  walls  surrounded the  acropolis  (Berges  ( 1995\u00ad96)). At  modern  Burgaz  there  are  traces  of  buildings  and  paved streets  dating  to  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  (AR ( 1999);  Gates  ( 1995)  236,(1997)  282).  Sherds  show  that  the site  goes  back  to  C 8.  The  harbour  has  been  located,  and  the moles  date  to  C 4.A C 4  boundary  stone  (provenance:  built into  the  mosque  in  Karak\u00f6y,  not  far  from  Burgaz)  marked the  harbour  (I.Knidos 613;  the  inscription  reads:  \u00b5). The  Knidioi  put  up  a  treasury  (Bommelaer  ( 1991)  pl.  V no. 219)  and  several  communal  dedications  at  Delphi.  The earliest  dates  to  C 6m  (I.Knidos 211),  and  two  more  were  put up  in  C 4  (I.Knidos 212  (C 4e),  213  (C 4l);  cf.  Jacquemin  ( 1999) nos. 113\u00ad18).  Knidian  C 6m  dedicatory  graffiti are also found in  the  temple  of  Apollon  Milasios  at  Naukratis  (I.Knidos 214\u00ad15),and  in  the  temple  of  Athena  at  Lindos  (I.Knidos 217). Knidos  struck  silver  coins  on,  first,  the  Milesian  and,  then, the  Aiginetan  standard  from  the  late  Archaic  period. Denominations:  drachm,  diobol,  obol.  Type:  obv.  forepart of  lion;  rev.  incuse  square  with  the  head  of  Aphrodite;  leg- end:  sometimes  or ,  after  411 . After 387  also  didrachm  and  hemidrachm,  and  the  obv.  and rev.  types  are  reversed,  with  a  magistrate's  name  sometimes added  on  the  rev.(HN \u00b2614\u00ad16;  Cahn  ( 1970);  SNG  Cop.  Caria 199\u00ad331).  In  addition,  Knidos  was  among  the  poleis  which  in C 5l\u00adC4e  struck  the  so-called  coins  (for  which  see Karwiese  ( 1980)). The  Knidioi  founded  a  colony  at  Lipara  (no. 34)  (Thuc. 3.88.2;  Paus. 10.11.3),  along  with  the  Rhodians  (Diod. 5.9), c. 580\u00ad576. 904.  (Kodapeis) Map 61.  Unlocated.  Type:  C:?

The  names  listed  in  this  inscription  (ll. 17\u00ad18)  sug- gest  that  there  was  a  strong  Karian  element  in  the  popula- tion  of  this  community  (Bl\u00fcmel  ( 1990)  38\u00ad42  (  SEG 40 991\u00ad92)),  and  it  is  a  moot  point  to  what  extent  the  Koliyrgeis can  be  considered  a  Hellenic  polis  in  the  Archaic  and Classical  periods. 906.

Koranza  is  called  a  polis  in  the political  sense  in  an  honorary  decree  from  Lagina  of 318 (I.Stratonikeia 503).

In 367/6  Mausolos  and  the  Koarendeis  granted  ateleia  to a certain  [.  .  .]  '\u00b5 [  ] ,and in 318  the  polis of  Koranza  granted  politeia  and  enktesis  to Konon,  son  of karia  1125 Poseidippos  (I.Stratonikeia 503).Apparently  the  Koarendeis met  in  an  ekklesia  kyria  with  some  sacred  kerykes (I.Stratonikeia 503.5\u00ad6;see Hornblower ( 1982)  71\u00ad72). In C 4  Chalketor  (no. 881)  passed  a  decree  granting  proxe- ny  and  citizenship  to  a  man  from  Koranza  (I.Mylasa 911). Around 350  a  man  named  Skoaranos  and  his  wife  dedi- cated  a  plot  of  land  to  Apollo  and  Artemis  (I.Stratonikeia 502).Moreover,the  Koranzeis  granted  exemption  from  slave taxes  and  other  taxes  except  for  the  royal  one  to  anyone  who looked  after  Skoaranos'  tomb  (ll. 20\u00ad22). Two  archons  are  mentioned  in  a  decree  of 318 (I.Stratonikeia 503.3). A  month  name, ,  from  Koranza  is  known  from  a decree  of 318  (I.Stratonikeia 503.2). The  names  of  the  archons  in  the  decree  of 318 (I.Stratonikeia 503)  and  the  envoys  from  Koranza  listed  in I.Mylasa 8  and  in  SEG 40  992.7\u00ad8  suggest  that  there  was  a strong  Karian  element  in  the  Koranzan  population,  and  it  is a  moot  point  to  what  extent  the  community  can  be  consid- ered  a  Hellenic  polis  in  the  Classical  period. 907.Krya  (Kryeus) Map  65.

Xenophon  refers  to Gryneion  as  one  of  the  personal  fiefs which  had  been  given  to  Gongylos  by  the  Persian  king  in  C 5, and  which  were  still  controlled  by  his  descendants  in  C 4e (Hell. 3.1.6;  see  also  Briant  ( 1985)).Yet  Gryneion  was  a  mem- ber  of  the  Delian  League.

In  335/4 Gryneion  was  captured  by  Parmenion,  who  subjected  its population  to  andrapodismos  (Diod. 17.7.9);  but  the  attested C 3  coinage  (SNG  Cop.

Nothing  is  known  explicitly  about  the  extent  of  Pitane's territory  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods.  But  since  it bordered  on  Mt.  Kane  to  the  west,  Elea  to  the  east,  and Teuthrania  to  the  north,  it  is  unlikely  to  have  exceeded  100 km \u00b2.  The  information  that  may  be  gleaned  from  Hellenistic sources  cannot  be  used  retrospectively  (on  territorial changes  and  consolidations  in  this  area  in  the  Hellenistic period,  see  most  recently  Savalli-Lestrade  ( 1992)). In C 5  Pitane  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.

Pitane received proxenia  from  Delphi  in  319  (F.Delphes iii.1410), and  another  grant  of  proxenia  given  to  a  citizen  of  Pitane  is recorded  in  an  undated  (C 3?)  decree  passed  by  an  unknown polis  located  in  Aiolis,  most  likely  Kyme  (SEG 47  1659). Pitane  had  city  walls  in  C 4,  and  probably  also  earlier.  In 335/4  it  was  besieged  by  Parmenion,  who  was  forced  to  lift the  siege  by  Memnon  (Diod. 17.7.9).

If  Nasos  and  Pordoselene  were  identical  (see infra)  then  this  community  was  probably  the  one  referred  to as  an  Aiolian  polis  in  the  political  sense  by  Hdt. 1.151.1.The full  form  of  the  city-ethnic  is  unattested,  but  the  collective and  internal  use  is  presumably  attested  in  abbreviated  form on  coins: (infra). Pordoselene  was  entered  by  the  toponym  ~ on  the  tribute  assessment  list  IG i\u00b3  77.iv.17 ( 422/1),  but  it  is  not  clear  whether  it  was  ever  a  paying  mem- ber  of  the  Delian  League.  It  does  not  reappear  in  any  surviv- ing  tribute  list.  The  community  is  listed  along  with  other Aktaioi  poleis,  suggesting  that  Nesos/Pordoselene  was  a Lesbian  dependency  in  C 5. Pordoselene  struck  coins  of  silver  and  bronze  from  C 5l  to C 4l.

On  the  unfounded  a  priori  assumption that  only  independent  communities  struck  coins,  Stauber ( 1996a)  i. 199  assumes  that  the  earliest  coins  minted  by aiolis  and  south-western  mysia  1049 Pordoselene  are  evidence  that  it  gained  independence  from Mytilene  in  427. Problems  arise  in  connection  with  any  attempt  to  locate the  site  of  Pordoselene,  the  most  vexing  of  which  is  the  ques- tion  whether  Pordoselene  was  identical  with  the  polis  of  the Nasiotai,  an  identification that may be suggested b y  the  joint entry  Nesos  Pordoselene  in  IG i\u00b3  77.iv.17.It  may  also  be  signif- icant  that  Hdt. 1.151.1  mentions  only  one  polis  on  the  islands known as  Hekatonnesoi  (however,  the  present  Inventory does  in  itself  indicate  that  Herodotos'  enumerations  of  com- munities  in  various  regions  of  the  Greek  world  cannot  be trusted  to  have  been  in  any  way  comprehensive).  The  debate is  summed  up  by  Stauber  ( 1996a)  i. 198\u00ad208:  communis opinio  has  been  that  Nasos  and  Pordoselene  were  two  differ- ent  poleis;  Nasos  on  the  island  now  known  as  Alibey  Adasi and  Pordoselene  on  the  smaller  island  of  Maden  Adasi. Stauber  objects  (ibid. 205\u00ad7)  that  Maden  Adasi,  being  an infertile  island  of  tuff,  could  not  have  supported  a  commun- ity  in  Antiquity:  indeed,  when  surveying  the  island  he  found no  evidence  at  all  for  an  ancient  settlement.  Stauber  is inclined  to conclude  that  there  was  indeed  only  one community,  which  was  located  on  Alibey  Adasi,  and  that Nasos/Nasiotes  temporarily  replaced  the  toponym  and  city- ethnic  of  Pordoselene  because  the  name  containing  the  word \"fart\"  was  perceived  as  an  embarrassment.  If  Stauber's  view is  correct,  then  the  information  set  out  s.v.  Nasos  in  the  pres- ent  Inventory  applies  to  Pordoselene  as  well. 832.

It  was  a  town  captured by  Thibron,  but  it  is  also  reported  that  Pergamon  was  ruled, presumably  as  a  tyranny  ( ),  by  Prokles  and Eurysthenes,  descendants  of  Demaratos  of  Lakedaimon  (see also  An. 7.8.17).  For  Demaratos,  who  was  given  \"land  and cities\"  (    ) b y  the  Persian  king  in  486,see Hdt. 6.70.  See  also  Briant  ( 1985).  The  collective use  of  the city-ethnic  is  presumably  attested  internally  in  abbreviated form  on  coins  (infra).  The  individual  and  external  use  is found  in  an  Epidaurian  proxeny  decree  of  C 4l/C3e  (IAEpid 42  xiii). The  constitutional  history  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical periods  is  unknown:  in  C 4  it  may  still  have been  controlled by  the  descendants  of  Gongylos,  who  may  have  received  the city  as  a  fief  from  the  Persian  king. For  a  full  description  of  the  Archaic  and  Classical  city walls,  see  Radt  ( 1992).  He  discusses  two  walls,  one  of  which (Wall  I)  may  date  from  C 7  or  even  earlier,  while  the  other (Wall  II)  probably  dates  from  C 5  and  covers  an  area  of 18  ha (Radt  ( 1994)  64).  The  article  also  contains  extensive  discus- sion  of  pottery  found  in  the  context  of  the  walls;  cf.  also  Radt ( 1999). Pergamon  struck  coins  of  silver  and  bronze  from  C 5m  to C 4e.

SNG  von  Aulock  no. 1348 ascribes  the  bronze  coins  to  C 4f. Despite  Radt's  discovery  of  significant amounts of Aiolian  grey  ware,  the  ethnic  composition  of  Pergamon's population  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  still  remains uncertain.  In  Xen.  An. 7.8.8  Xenophon  is  entertained  by a woman  called  `,  wife  of  Gongylos  of  Eretria  and mother  of  Gorgion  and  Gongylos.  Ironically,  her  name  may bear  witness  to  her  non-Greek  origins  or,  at  the  very  least,  to the  ethnically  mixed  nature  of  the  community  in  which  she lived.  The  name  is  rare,  and  the  entries  in  LPGN  suggest  that, in  the  Greek  world  in  the  Classical  period,  it  was  borne  pre- dominantly  by  slaves.  Her  two  sons  controlled  four  cities  in Mysia  and  Aiolis  (Gambrion,  Palaigambrion,  Myrina  and Gryneion)  which  the  Persian  king  had  given  as  fiefs t o  their ancestor  in  return  for  his  loyalty  as  a  mediser  (Xen.  Hell. 3.1.6). 829.Perperene  (Perperenios) Map  56.  Lat. 39.15,long. 27.00.  Size  of  territory:  ?  Type:  C:?

The  city-ethnic  is recorded as (Androtion  (FGrHist 324)  fr. 15  apud  Steph.  Byz. 508.15\u00ad16),  but  the  three  attested  epi- graphical  (albeit  Hell./Rom.)  sources  for  the  city-ethnic suggest  that  the  normal  version  was   (I.Smyrna 447.4,469.2\u00ad3,689.ii.23\u00ad24).This  is  confirmed b y C 4  coin  legends  (infra).  Perperene  is  not  called  a polis  by  any  extant  Classical  source;  Galen,  De  Victu Attenuante 102  provides  the  earliest  attestation.  The  collec- tive  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  presumably  attested  internally in  abbreviated  form  on  coins  (infra)  and  is  attested  external- ly  in  Androtion  (FGrHist 324)  fr. 15.", "Larisa": "Identifier: 819. , (Larisaios) Map  56.

Hell. 3.1.7)  or  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.152,  but  see  infra). The  legend  on C4coins is presumably an abbre- viated  form  of  the  city-ethnic  rather  than  the  toponym (infra).  As  part  of  the  original  Aiolian  dodekapolis  Larisa  is called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Hdt. 1.149.1,  with  the  ter- ritorial  sense  as  a  possible  connotation,  and  in  the  political sense  at  Hdt. 1.150.2.  Larisa  is  called  a  polis  in  Xen.  Cyr. 7.1.45 in  a  retrospective C 6  context,  describing  how  Kyros  gave Kyllene  and  Larisa  to  his  Egyptian  troops  in  546.Presumably polis  is  used  here  in  its  topographical  sense,  denoting  Larisa's urban  centre  and  its  hinterland.  But  the  reference  to  the Egyptians'  unfailing  loyalty  indicates  that  the  political  sense is  a  connotation.  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  pre- sumably  attested  internally  on  coins  (infra).  It  is  attested externally  at  Xen.  Hell. 3.1.7  and  possibly  in  the  Athenian assessment  decree  of 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.152).  The  toponym  is restored  in  the  assessment  decree  of 422/1  (IG i\u00b3  77.iv.19). Larisa  was  perhaps  claimed  by  the  Athenians  as  a  member  of the  Delian  League:  the  city-ethnic  in  IG i\u00b3  71.i.152 is  listed  in  the  Ionian  district  immediately  after  ~, which  might  indicate  that  the  reference  is  to  the  other  Larisa at  Ephesos.  However,  it  is  impossible  to  draw  any  firm geo- graphical  conclusion  on  the  basis  of  the  sequence  of  poleis  in the  Athenian  lists,  and  the  city-ethnic  of  Ephesian  Larisa attested  in  inscriptions  of  the  Roman  period  (e.g.  I.Ephesos 3272  and 3274)  is  ,which indicates  that  the  Larisa in  the  assessment  decree  is  in  fact  the  one  in  Aiolis. There  is  no  epigraphical  attestation  of  Larisa's  diplomat- ic  relations  with  the  outside  world  before  the  early Hellenistic  period  (Fraser,  Samothrace ii.1  no. 23  1\u00ad2 (C 3l/C2e),  which  mentions  theoroi). Schefold  ( 1933)  145\u00ad48  reports  on  stoas  from  the  Archaic and  Classical  periods  (C 6f  and  C 5).  In  his  publication  he also  reported  that  on  the  acropolis,  three-quarters  of  which had  been  excavated,  he  had  found  remains  of  a  road,  walls, towers,  gates,  an  altar  and  temple,  a  palace  and  wells,  all  of which  seemed  to  date  from  the  Archaic  period.  The  fortifi- cations,  however,  have  later  been  downdated  to  C 5  (Lang ( 1996)  228\u00ad29).  Lang's  account  (( 1996)  224)  mentions  a  pre- Greek  cult  site,  on  top  of  which  a  small  C 6  temple  was  built, followed  by  a  much  larger  temple  c. 530.  The  palace,  of  the bit-hilani  type,  was  constructed  in  three  phases  in  C 6,  with later  work of  rebuilding  c. 400  (Boehlau  and  Schefold  ( 1940) 27\u00ad30).For  a  very  useful  summary  of  the  remains  of  Archaic Larisa,  see  Lang  ( 1996)  224\u00ad31.Water  was  supplied  to the  for- tified city b y  pipes  (Xen.  Hell. 3.1.7).  Schefold  ( 1933)  148 described  two  cisterns  and  a  well  of  polygonal  masonry  next to  a  large  building  complex  from  C 5.  The  building  may  have been  used  for  public  administration. Larisa  was  walled  in  C 4  (Xen.  Hell. 3.1.7),  and  the  remains of  the  C 4  fortification of  both  the  acropolis  and  the  town  are described  in  Boehlau  and  Schefold  ( 1940)  52\u00ad56. The  coinage  of  Larisa  Phrikonis  has  generated  a  good  deal of  controversy.  The  coins  in  question  are  C 4  issues  of  silver and  bronze.  ( 1)  Silver:  obv.  female  head  wearing  sphendone; rev.  amphora;  legend: .(2) Bronze:  obv.  bearded head;  rev.  amphora  between  corn-gain,  r.  and  ,l.

In  BMC Troas  p. 134  ( 3)  and  ( 4)  are  ascribed  to  Larisa  in  Troas.  On  the problem  relating  to the  attribution  of  coins  to each  of  the three  Asian  poleis  called  Larisa,  see  Imhoof-Blumer  ( 1901\u00ad2) 1171\u00ad76  nos. 2064\u00ad70  and  Robert  ( 1951)  47\u00ad64,  who  wants the  amphora  types  ( 1)\u00ad(4),  with  both  male  and  female heads,  to  be  ascribed  to  Larisa  in  the  Troad,  while  the  \"bull- types\"  ( 5)  should  be  assigned  to  Larisa  Phrikonis  on  the grounds  that  a  similar  type  was  minted  in  Boione,  which presumably  was  located  nearby  in  the  Hermos  valley;  cf.  also Robert ( 1982). In 546  Kyros  gave  Larisa  to  his  Egyptian  troops,  whose descendants  were  still  inhabiting  the  polis  in  Xenophon's day (Xen.  Cyr. 7.1.45).The  presence  of  a  non-Greek  element  may explain  the  existence  of  a  palace.  However,  the  presence  of an  Archaic  Aiolian  population  is  confirmed b y  C 7  and  C 6 aiolis  and  south-western  mysia  1045 graffiti at the t emple  of  Athena  (Boehlau  and  Schefold ( 1943)  123  and 183).It  is  conceivable  that  they  made  up  a  con- siderable  proportion  of  the  citizen  body  of  Larisa  in  the Classical  period,  and  that  the  polis  was  considered  Greek. 819.

The  legend  on  C 4  coins  is  presumably  an  abbre- viated  form  of  the  city-ethnic  (infra).  If  the  identification of Chalkis  with  modern  \u00c7iplakada  is  correct,  the  territory  of this  community  was  c. 2.5  km \u00b2.  \u00c7iplakada  belongs  to  a  group of  twenty-three  islands  known  as  Hekatonnesoi,  first men- tioned  by  Herodotos  ( 1.151.2),  who  reports  on  one  Aiolian polis  there  (no. 823).  It  is  very  unlikely  that  he  has  the  settle- ment  at  \u00c7iplakada  in  mind,  however:  the  larger  polis Pordoselene/Nasos  is  a  far  more  plausible  candidate.  The island  has  yet  to  be  excavated,  but  Stauber  and  his  team  have reported  substantial  surface  finds that point t o  a  sizeable Hellenistic\u00adRoman  settlement.  They  also  observed  a  fortifi- cation  wall,  the  lower  courses  of  which  appear  to  be  quite  old (Stauber  ( 1996a)  i. 228),  and  find it highly plausible that the island  contained  a  settlement  in  the  Classical  period  (C 5/C4). Stauber  (( 1996a)  ii. 280\u00ad82)  ascribes  C 4  bronze  coinage  to this community,  but  with  caution.  Types:  obv.  female  head  r.

The city-ethnic  is  (Babelon,  Trait\u00e9  ii. 2.  2046)  or (ibid. 2047,  after  Alexander  the  Great).  Leukai  is implicitly  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skylax. 98 (cf.  Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  142)  and  retrospec- tively  by  Diodorus  at  15.92.1  (r 362/1)  (urban  sense)  and 15.18.1\u00ad2  (rC 4)  (political  sense).  The  collective  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on  coins  (infra). The  name  and  extent  of  its  territory  are  not  attested  for the  Classical  period;  but  according  to  Ps.-Skylax  98,  it  con- tained  more  than  one  harbour  (   \u00b5). Leukai  was  situated  on  the  coast  (Diod. 15.18.1)  between Smyrna  and  Phokaia  (Strabo  14.1.38).In  Barr.  it  is  represent- ed  as  an  island  c. 10  km  south  of  the  coast  of  Asia  Minor.  The only  authority  for  this  is  Plin.  HN 5.119:  oppidum  Leucae  in promonturio,  quod  insula  fuit.  If  this  piece  of  information carries  any  weight,  it  must  relate  to  the  Archaic  period  or before.  In  the  Classical,  Hellenistic,  Roman  and  Late  Roman periods  Leukai  must  have  been  a  coastal  city. Leukai  was  founded  by  Tachos  after  the  death  of  Glos c. 383/2  (Diod. 15.18.1;  see  Stylianou  ( 1997)  208).  Later,  both Kyme  and  Klazomenai  wanted  to  gain  control  of  Leukai  and consulted  the  oracle  in  Delphi,  who  responded  that  the  polis that  first managed t o  make  a  sacrifice at L eukai  at  a  specified date  should  be  the  winner  of  the  dispute  (Diod. 15.18.2;see Fontenrose  ( 1978)  H 15).  Since  it  was  stipulated  that  rep- resentatives  from  the  two  poleis  should  depart  at  dawn on the  day  specified for the sacrifice,  the  Klazomenians  found- ed  a  polis  close  to  Leukai  and  thus  won  the  contest.  This event  was  commemorated  by  a  festival  called  Prophthaseia (Diod. 15.18.3\u00ad4,  but  without  any  indication  of  whether  the festival  was  held  at  Klazomenai  or  Leukai).  C. 362  Leukai served  as  a  naval  base  for  the  Egyptian  fleet c ommanded  by Reomithres  (Diod. 15.92.1).  Leukai  possessed  a  sanctuary  of Apollo  (Diod. 15.18.1). Leukai  struck  coins  in  silver  and  bronze  in  C 4s. Denominations:  obol,  hemiobol  and  small  fractions  in bronze.  ( 1)  Silver  obol:  types:  obv.  head  of  Aphrodite  or Artemis,  crescent;  legend: ;  rev.  swan,  crescent;  legend: .

According  to Babelon  (Trait\u00e9  II. 2  1159\u00ad60),the  striking  similarity  between the  coins  of  Klazomenai  and  those  of  Leuke  suggests  that Leuke  was  a  polis  dependent  on  Klazomenai. The  ethnic  composition  of  the  population  of  Leukai  is not  known;  but  it  may  have  contained  a  non-Greek  element, given  the  history  of  its  foundation,  even  after  it  became  a Klazomenian  dependency. 820.

The  collective use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 456.12 (C 4l\u00adC3).  The  earliest  external  attestations  are  Hellenistic (collective  use:  Polyb. 5.77.4;  individual  use:  SEG 32  1322 (C 3),  Cyprus;  IG xi.41042  (C 3),  Delos). Little  is  known  about  the  extent  of  Aigai's  territory  in  the Archaic  and  Classical  periods.  However,  a  C 4l  treaty between  Aigai  and  the  community  of  the  Olympenoi (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 456)  was  set  up  at  a  small  ancient  settlement near  Yenice  K\u00f6y,  located  c. 5  km  north-west  of  the  urban  cen- tre  of  Aigai.  Reinach  ( 1891)  272  inferred  from  the  inscription that  the  village  was  dependent  on  Aigai;  but  more  evidence is  needed  to  corroborate  Reinach's  interpretation. 1038 rubinstein Herodotos  lists  Aigai  among  the  twelve  original  Aiolian poleis  in 1.149.1,  and  Malay  ( 1994)  no. 515  is  indeed  written  in the  Aiolic  dialect.  The  polis  was  not  a  member  of  the  Delian League,  and  it  may  be  assumed  that  the  Persians  maintained at  least  nominal  control  over  the  polis  during  C 5  and  C 4. However,  according  to Xen.  Hell. 4.8.5,in  394  Derkylidas claimed,  presumably  exaggerating,  that  even  in  Asia  Minor itself  there  were  poleis  such  as  Temnos  and  Aigai  where  it would  be  possible  to  live  without  being  subjected  ( ) to  the  Persian  king. Only  one  Aigaian  treaty  survives  from  the  Classical  period, viz.  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 456,  concluded  between  Aigai  and  the Olympenoi  regulating  the  seasonal  transhumance  of  flocks. Malay  ( 1994)  no. 515  is  a  public  enactment  ( \u00b5\u00b5),which mentions  officials ( ,A. 3)  and  a  priest  ( ,A.5). Bohn  and  Schuchhardt  ( 1889)  describe  the  visible remains  of  the  urban  centre  of  Aigai,  which  had  been  com- pletely  rebuilt  after  an  earthquake  in  ad  17.  Of  older remains,  only  the  inner  city  wall  may  be  pre-Hellenistic (ibid. 10),  and  a  second,  larger,  city  wall  may  be  dated  with reasonable  certainty  to  the  reign  of  Eumenes  II.  The  pre- Hellenistic  wall  is  constructed  in  rough  polygonal  masonry and  had  a  circumference  of  no  more  than  1  km,  enclosing  an area  of  triangular  shape  (ibid. 8\u00ad9),  and  this  points  to  an urban  centre  of  a  modest  size.  Radt  ( 1991)  discusses  remains of  monumental  architecture  and  argues  in  favour  of  con- necting  a  C 6  Aiolian  capital  with  the  site  of  Aigai. The  earliest  coinage  of  Aigai  dates  from  C 3  (Head,  HN \u00b2 552),  although  Head  ( 1875)  293  tentatively  assigned  a  num- ber  of  electrum  coins  from  600\u00ad550  to Aigai. 802.

Apart  from  the  numismatic  evidence  we  have  no information  about  this  settlement;  but  we  know  that  the mountain  Autokane  (referred  to  as  in  Hdt. 7.42.1)  was adjacent  to  the  polis  of  Kane/Kanai,  which  had  two  harbours (Schuchhardt  ( 1887)  1209  and  Tomascheck  ( 1891)  25).One  of these  may  have  been  Autokane.  Other  scholars  have  suggest- ed  that  Autokane  and  Kanai  were  identical  (Barr.).  This hypothesis  may  be  supported  by  the  fact  that  we  have  no numismatic  evidence  for  Kanai,  which  is  otherwise  quite well  attested:  it  is  recorded,  e.g.,  in  a  C 2  Delphian  list  of  the- orodokoi  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  1  ID(a) 10).

The fact  that  it  was  entered  as  one  of  the  Aktaioi  poleis  may  sug- gest  that  it  was  a  polis  dependent  on  Lesbos,  presumably Mytilene  (no. 798).

Their proposition  that  Karene  belonged  to  the  Lesbian  or  Chian peraiai  in  the  Classical  period  is  plausible,  but  cannot  be  ver- ified.  According  to Ephor.  fr. 126,  a contingent  of  citizens  of Karene  settled  in  Ephesos  in  connection  with  a  stasis  shortly after  the  foundation  of  Ephesos  and  gave  their  name  to  one of  the  five E phesian  phylai. 814.Killa  Map 56.

This inscription  is  a  boundary  stone  marking  the  frontier between  the  territory  of  the  Herakleotai  and  that  of  the Melampagitai.  The  collective  and  internal  use  is  presumably attested  in  abbreviated  form  on  C 4  coins  (infra).  Ramsay ( 1881)  297  argued  in  favour  of  locating  Herakleia  at  a  site near  the  station  at  Emir  Aalem  where  he  observed  \"a  grass- grown  tumulus,  and  a  little  beyond  it  is  a  hill,  with  remains of  a  small  fortified t own.  The  walls  could  be  traced  all  round the  hill,  sometimes  appearing  above  the  ground,  sometimes showing  only  a  slight  elevation  in  the  grassy  hill.  The  style  of building  was  not  apparent,  but  was  certainly  not  the  finer kind  of  Greek  work.\"  Keil  ( 1913)  163\u00ad64  adopted  a  more  cau- tious  position,  pointing  out  that  there  were  remains  of  many ancient  settlements  in  the  area,  none  of  which  can  be  ident- ified w ith  Herakleia  with  any  certainty.

Kisthene  has  been  located  (with  some  caution) at  G\u00f6me\u00e7  by  Stauber  ( 1996a)  i. 159\u00ad62.  According  to  Isoc. 4.153,Kisthene  was  conquered  by  Agesilaos  and  his  troops  in 397,  and  the  soldiers  were  rewarded  with  100  tal.  This  piece of  information  must  be  taken  with  a  grain  of  salt;  but  if  this figure is anywhere near the t ruth,  it  is  an  important  indica- tion  of  the  prosperity  of  Kisthene. Kisthene  struck  coins  in  C 4.(1)  Silver  and  bronze  issued by  Orontas  c. 357\u00ad352  (or  perhaps  in  362/1:  for  this  dispute, see  Troxell  ( 1981);  contra  Moysey ( 1989)).Types:  obv.  hoplite, or  head  of  Orontas;  legend:  sometimes  ;  rev.  forepart  of winged  boar,  or  horseman;  legend: or or .(2) Bronze coins,  C 4s:  obv.  head  of  Demeter;  rev. horseman  with  bee  or  dolphin;  legend: or  (Stauber  ( 1996a)  ii. 261\u00ad64,cat.nos.1\u00ad5  ( 1),nos.6\u00ad7  ( 2);  SNG Cop.

Presumably  polis  is used  here  in  its  territorial  sense,  denoting  Kyllene's  urban centre  and  its  hinterland.  But  the  reference  to  the  Egyptians' unfailing  loyalty  indicates  that  the  political  sense  is  a  conno- tation.  Xenophon  claims  that  in  his  day  the  polis  is  still inhabited  by  the  descendants  of  the  Egyptians.  It  is  not known  what  proportion  (if  any)  of  its  citizen  body  would  be perceived  as  Greek. 817.Kyme  (Kymaios) Map  56.  Lat. 38.45,long.  26.55.  Size of  territory: 2  or 3.  Type:  A: .The toponym is \u00b5,  (Hes. Op. 636;  Hdt. 1.149.1;  Thuc. 3.31.1;  Ps.-Skylax 98;  SEG 23 189.ii.18  (c. 330)).  The  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5  (Hdt. 1.158, 4.138;  IG i\u00b3  71.i.124).  According  to  Steph.  Byz. 80.23\u00ad25, Hecat.  fr. 226  provided  an  alternative  toponym, \u00b5, and  at  1.149.1  Herodotos  has  \u00b5   \u00b5 (according  to  Strabo  13.1.3,  called  Phrikonis  after  Mt. Phrikion  in  Lokris).  As part  of  the  original  Aiolian dodekapolis  Kyme  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Hdt. 1.149.1  and 5.123.1,  in  both  cases  with  the  territorial  sense  as  a possible  connotation,  and  in  the  political  sense  at  Hdt. 1.150.2.  The  urban  sense  is  also  attested  at  Thuc. 3.31.1  and Ps.-Skylax 98,  and  the  political  sense  at  Hdt. 4.137.2,  138.2 and 5.37.2\u00ad38.1,  where  Kyme  is  listed  under  the  heading  polis among  a  number  of  tyrannically  governed  communities. Aristotle  included  Kyme  among  his  politeiai: \u00b5 no. 90  frr. 530\u00ad31;  Heracl.  Lemb. 36\u00ad39.The aiolis  and  south-western  mysia  1043 word astos  is  used  about  the  citizens  of  Kyme  in  Hdt. 1.158.2. The  collective  and  internal  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested on  Hellenistic  coins  (SNG  Cop.  Aeolis 103\u00ad15),  in  abbreviat- ed  forms  on  coins  of  the  Classical  period  (infra);  the  external use  is  attested  in  literary  sources  (Hdt. 1.157.3)  and  in  the Athenian  tribute  lists  (IG i\u00b3  261.v.2).  The  individual  use  is attested  externally  in  Hdt. 4.138.2,  5.37.1  and  IG ii\u00b2  9116  (C 4). The  territory was  called  \u00b5,  (Thuc. 8.101.2),  and  it comprised  a  settlement  called  Blakeia  (Arist.  fr. 531.1\u00ad2).  Idil ( 1989)  529  reported  on  the  existence  of  two  harbours,  both of  which  were  probably  used  for  military  purposes  in  C 5  and C 4.  Ps.-Skylax 98  mentions  only  one  (see  map  in  Bean ( 1966)  104  fig 15). Kyme  was  a  dependent  polis  in  the  Persian  Empire:  Hdt. 7.194.1  mentions  a  Sandokes  son  of  Thamasios, \u00b5     ,  who  served  as  general  in Xerxes'  fleet.  We  do  not  know  if  Kyme  participated  in  the Ionian  Revolt:  the  only  Aiolians  mentioned  specifically b y Herodotos  are  the  Lesbians,  and  from  his  account  it  appears that  there  was  no  Kymaian  naval  contingent  present  at  the battle  of  Lade.  In  C 5  Kyme  was  a  member  of  the  Delian League.  It  belonged  to  the  Ionian  district  and  is  recorded from  452/1  (IG i\u00b3  261.v.2)  to  421/20  (IG i\u00b3  285.ii.10)  a  total  of thirteen  times,  twice  completely  restored.  In  the  first y ears  it paid 12  tal.,  from  448/7  reduced to 9  tal.  (IG i\u00b3  264.i.13).It  was assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.i.124).In  411  Kyme  sup- plied  a  contingent  of  fifty  hoplites  to  help  the  Spartans  and Methymnaians  against  the  Athenians  and  the  Mytilenaians (Thuc. 8.100.3).  In  408  the  Kymaians  sent  an  embassy  to Athens  to  complain  of  Alkibiades'  conduct  (Diod. 13.73.6). Kymaians  appointed  theorodokoi  to  host  theoroi  from  Argos (SEG 23  189.ii.18  ( 330\u00ad324)),and  to  host  theoroi  from  Nemea (SEG 36  331.ii.34\u00ad35  ( 331/30\u00ad313)). Little  is  known  about  the  constitutional  history  of  Kyme. Herakleides  (Polit. 10.16)  reports  that  Pheidon  and  later Prometheus  legislated  in  order  to  enfranchise  more  citizens (perhaps  after  700).  According  to Pheidon's law,  the  fran- chise  was  given  to  citizens  who  could  breed  at  least  one horse.  Later  Prometheus  included  another  thousand  cit- izens  in  the  constitution.  The  constitution  was  replaced  by  a tyranny  at  the  bidding  of  Kyros  (Herakleides,  Polit. 11.5:      \u00b5    ).  According  to  Arist.  fr. 530,  1\u00ad2,  the  offi- cial  title  of  the  tyrant  was  \u00b5.  C. 512  the  tyrant  of Kyme  was  Aristagoras,  son  of  Herakleides  (Hdt. 4.138.2), who  was  deposed  in  500/499,but  not  killed  by  the  Kymaians (Hdt. 5.37\u00ad38).  Later  (perhaps  much  later)  the  polis  had  a democratic  constitution  which,  again,  was  replaced  by  an oligarchy  on  the  instigation  of  a  certain  Thrasymachos,  who is  characterised  as  a  \"demagogos\"  (Arist.  Pol. 1304b41\u00ad5a1, probably  referring  to  Aiolic  Kyme;  cf.  Aubonnet  in  the  Bud\u00e9 edn.  p. 171  n. 2).  The  stasis  was  triggered  by  the  democrats using  their  power  to  soak  the  rich  (b 20\u00ad24).  One  of Plutarch's Quaestiones  Graecae--presumably derived from the  Aristotelian  collection  of  politeiai--concerns K yme, probably  Aiolian  Kyme,  and  mentions  a  boule,a board of basileis  and  a  magistrate  in  charge  of  the  desmoterion  (Plut. Mor. 291E\u00ad92A).So  far,  the  only  surviving  public  enactment antedating  306  is  I.Kyme 1,a C 4l  honorary  decree  passed  by the  demos.  Arist.  Pol. 1268b\u00ad1269a  refers  to  legislation (nomos)  on  homicide.  Free  non-citizens  appear  to  have  been resident  in  Kyme:  a  funerary  inscription  found  at  Kyme  near the  sanctuary  of  Isis  and  datable  to  C 4  commemorates  a  cit- izen  of  Lampsakos  (BCH 51  ( 1927)  p. 386  no. 7).  The  inscrip- tion  SEG 47  1663  (c. 500)  mentions  two  foreigners,  one  from Paros  and  one  from  Samos. In 546  the  Kymaians  sent  to  the  oracle  in Branchidai  (Hdt. 1.157\u00ad60).  According  to  Diod. 15.18.2, Kyme  and  Klazomenai  consulted  the  oracle  in  Delphi  in  383, shortly  after  the  death  of  Tachos,  in  connection  with  their dispute  over  Leukai,  which  contained  an  Apollo  sanctuary (Fontenrose  ( 1978)H15). Until  now  few  remains  of  Archaic  and  Classical  public architecture  have  been  excavated.  An  Isis  temple,  excavated by  Salac  in  1925,  may have dated  back  to C 4,  perhaps  origi- nally  dedicated  to  a  different  goddess  (Kybele/Artemis,  later also  Aphrodite,  as  suggested  by  Idil  ( 1989)  527).  Akurgal ( 1956)  12  reported  on  a  C 4  capital.  Sch\u00e4fer  and  Schl\u00e4ger ( 1962)  52  describe  a  pier,  in  part  from  C 6.  Recent  deep soundings  have  revealed  a  late  Archaic  building  on  one  of Kyme's  two  acropolises  (Gates  ( 1997)).  Kyme  was  probably fortified as early as C 6  (Hdt. 1.160.1,  who  reports  on  the reluctance  by  the  citizens  of  Kyme  to  incur  the  risk  of  a  siege in 546).  Recently,  Archaic  walls  have  been  discovered beneath  the  Hellenistic  fortifications (Gates ( 1994)  275).The city  was  besieged  by  Tissaphernes  c. 400  (Diod. 14.35.7). Kyme  struck  coins  of  silver  and  bronze  from  C 7l  onwards. Denominations:  stater,  hemidrachm,  hemiobol.  ( 1)  Silver, C 7l:  obv.  forepart  of  horse,  beneath,  monogram  (?);  rev. incuse  square  containing  ornamented  star,  beside  it  (as  coun- termark)  smaller  incuse  square  containing  a  star  of  different design.

Aeolis 30\u00ad86.) According  to  Ephor.  fr. 114,  Kyme  was  founded  by Amazons.  Kyme  reportedly  colonised  (or  participated  in  the colonisations  of)  ( 1)  Kebren  in  the  Troad  (Ephor.  fr. 10);  ( 2) Ainos  in  Thrace,  which  was  first founded b y  Alopekonnesioi and  later  received  epoikoi  from  Mytilene  and  Kyme  (Ephor. fr. 39);  and  ( 3)  Side  in  Pamphylia  (Ps.-Skylax  101;Arr.

The  Aiolic  forms  \u00b5/\u00b5  are  attested  on C 4  coins  (infra)  and  in  Hellenistic  inscriptions  (I.Perg. 5  Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 555  (C 3e)).  As  part  of  the  original  Aiolian dodekapolis  Temnos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at Hdt. 1.149.1,  with  the  territorial  sense  as  a  possible  connota- tion,  and  in  the  political  sense  at  Hdt. 1.150.2.  Xenophon refers  to it  as  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense,  indicating  that  the community  was  small  (Hell. 4.8.5:  \u00b5 )).  The collective  and  internal  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  presumably attested  in  abbreviated  form  on  C 4  coins  (infra),  the  exter- nal  use  is  found  in  a  C 3e  decree  (I.Perg. 5.2).  For  the  individ- ual  and  external  use,  see  Xen.  An. 4.4.15: \u00b5 \u00b5. Although  Temnos  is  attested  as  a  flourishing c ommunity in  the  Hellenistic  period  (e.g.  Herrmann  ( 1979)),  next  to nothing  is  known  about  the  political  and  constitutional  history  of  Temnos  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods.  The community  may  have  been  dependent  on  the  Persian  king (it  was  never  a  member  of  the  Delian  League,  at  any  rate);  in 394,  however,  according  to Xen.  Hell. 4.8.5,  Derkylidas  men- tioned  Temnos  as  a  polis  where  it  would  be  possible  to  live without  being  subjected  ( ) to the Persian king.  On this  remark,  which  perhaps  should  not  be  taken  too  serious- ly,  see  the  entry  for  Aigai  supra. Temnos  struck  bronze  coins  in  C 4.

Fossey  ( 1994)  37). Adramyttion  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by Herodotos 7.42.1,  and  Ps.-Skylax  98  mentions  Adramyttion under  the  heading  ... ` .That it was a polis  in  the  political  sense  too  is  indicated  by  Aristotle's inclusion  of  Adramyttion  in  his  collection  of  politeiai  (Arist. fr. 473).  The  collective  and  internal  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  on  Hellenistic  coins,  in  abbreviated  forms  on  coins of  the  Classical  period  (infra).  The  external  and  individual use  is  attested  in  a  federal  proxenia  decree  of  Boiotia,  pre- sumably  passed  in  C 4  (IG vii  2860). Adramyttion  probably  was  not  a  member  of  the  Delian League:  the  restoration  [ \u00b5]  in  IG i\u00b2  192.iii.13  has been  rejected  in  IG i\u00b3  260.iv.16,  where  the  editor  now  reads [ ].  According  to  Thucydides  5.1.1  and 8.108.4, Persia  retained  firm c ontrol  of  Adramyttion  in  C 5: Pharnakes,  the  satrap  of  Hellespontine  Phrygia,  allowed refugees  from  Delos,  who  had  been  driven  out  by  the Athenians  in  422,  to  settle  at  Adramyttion,  where  they  seem to  have  remained  until  they  were  allowed  to  return  home  in 421/0  (Thuc. 5.32.1).  Perhaps  some  of  them  stayed  on:  if  the massacre  of  the  Delians  in  Adramyttion  by  Arsakes  (Thuc. 8.108.4)  is  to  be  placed  in  411,  as  proposed  e.g.  by  Stauber ( 1996a)  i. 133,  this  might  suggest  Delian  settlement  of  a  more permanent  nature.  On  the  problems  related  to  Arsakes' murder  of  some  of  the  Delians  and  Arsakes'  connections with  Tissaphernes  and  Pharnakes,  see  Gomme  et al.( 1981) 356\u00ad57,  who  follow  the  conventional  view  that  the  massacre took  place  c. 421,  and  Hornblower  ( 1996)  423\u00ad24. Presumably  the  polis  remained  under  Persian  control  dur- ing  most  of  C 4  as  well,  although  in  Ps.-Skylax  98  it  is described  as  a  polis  Hellenis  and  the  region  as  being  under Lesbos,  perhaps  in  the  period  404\u00ad386.  It  is  conceivable  that one  of  the  Lesbian  poleis,  which  had  control  of  significant territory  on  the  mainland,  may  also  have  controlled Adramyttion  as  a  dependent  polis. The  first epigraphical attestation of  Adramyttion's  rela- tions  with  the  rest  of  the  Greek  world  is  IG vii  2860  (C 4), bestowing  proxenia  and  other  privileges  on  the  Adramyttian honorand.  However,  a  number  of  jugs  \"from  Adramyttion\" are  recorded  in  a  Delian  inventory  of 364/3  (I.Delos 104.12). Silver  and  bronze  coins  were struck  in  Adramyttion  by Orontas  c. 357\u00ad352  or  perhaps  in  362/1  in  connection  with  the satrap's  revolt  (Troxell  ( 1981);  contra  Moysey ( 1989)).For  the \"autonomous  bronze  coinage\"  struck  in  C 4f  with  the  legend of  Adramyttion,  see  the  catalogue  in  Stauber  ( 1996a) ii. 193\u00ad96  nos. 11\u00ad26.Types:  obv.  head  of  Zeus;  rev.  forepart  of winged  horse;  legend: or .The full form of  the  ethnic  ( ) is attested on coins of C 2  and  later:  ibid.  nos. 27ff. As  for  the  ethnic  composition  of  the  population  of Adramyttion,  the  polis  must  have  been  sufficiently Hellenised  in  C 4s  to  merit  inclusion  in  Aristotle's  collection of  politeiai,  but  it  may  well  have  contained  an  ethnically mixed  citizen  body  throughout  the  Classical  period  and even  later.  Later  tradition  largely  agrees  in  regarding Adramyttion  as  a  Lydian  foundation.  Aristotle  (fr. 473, Gigon)  claims  that  the  polis  was  founded  by  Adramytos,  the son  of  Alyattes  and  brother  of  Kroisos.  Rival  traditions  are all  later. 801.

The  terri- tory is  called     (Hdt. 6.29.1)  and  comprised the  location  Malene  (for  the  problems  related  to  the  ident- ification of  Malene,  see  Stauber  ( 1996a)  i. 241\u00ad42). According  to  Hdt. 1.160.4,  the  Chians  gained  possession of  Atarneus  in  return  for  handing  over  Paktyes  to Kyros  in 547/6;  see  also  Hdt. 8.106.1,  who  refers  to Atarneus  as  in \"Mysian  territory\"  and  occupied  by  Chians.  However,  Xen. Hell. 3.2.11  describes  Atarneus  as  occupied  by  refugees  from Chios,  which  may  indicate  that  at  that  time  it  had  turned into  some  kind  of  splinter  community  over  which  the Chians  had  lost  control  (compare,  e.g.,  the  relationship between  Anaia  and  Samos  during  the  Peloponnesian  War). See  also  Diod. 13.65.4,mentioning  how  exiled  Chian  democ- rats  used  Atarneus  as  a  base  for  their  raids  against  the  island in 409.  Even  during  the  tyranny  of  Hermias  from  c. 355,  it  is clear  that  the  Chians  still  maintained  some  interest  in  and had  a  claim  to  the  site  (Theopomp.  fr. 291). Tod 165  may  be  regarded  as  a  treaty  entered  into  by Atarneus  with  Erythrai  in  so  far  as  the  treaty  concerned Atarneus  as  a  community,  if  only  indirectly,  and  was  to  be publicised  in  the  sanctuary  of  Atarneus  (Tod  165.32\u00ad33).  On the  other  hand,  the  party  to  the  treaty  is  Hermias  rather  than the  polis  as  a  whole,  and  it  is  significant that the delegates appointed  to  take  the  oath  on  behalf  of  Hermias  and  his associates  are  not  referred  to as  representatives  of  the  polis  of Atarneus. Atarneus  is  described  as  a  city  in  Mysia  (Hdt. 1.160.4;Isoc. 4.144).  The  site  of  Atarneus  has  been  located  on  Kale  Tepe, on  which  there  are  substantial  remains  of  C 4  buildings  and a  large  preserved  section  of  Atarneus'  city  wall  dating  from C 5  or  C 4  (Stauber  ( 1996a)  i. 269\u00ad72).  The  city  wall  is  also attested  in  Xen.  Hell. 3.2.11  and  Arist.  Pol. 1267a32,  both  of which  relate  to  sieges  of  Atarneus,  in  398/7  and  c. 350  respec- tively.  The  site  in  Kale  Tepe  has  yielded  a  considerable amount  of  surface  finds from C 4,  pottery  as  well  as  tiles (Stauber  ( 1996a)  i. 271),  which  suggests  occupation  of  a  rela- tively  high  density.  A  sanctuary  (     ) is designated  as  a  site  in  which  the  treaty  between  Hermias  and Erythrai  is  to  be  displayed  (Tod  165.32). aiolis  and  south-western  mysia  1039 Atarneus  struck  coins  in  silver  and  bronze  from  c. 400 onwards:  obv.  head  of  Apollo,  or  head  of  goddess;  rev.  coiled snake;  legend: or (Stauber  ( 1996a)  ii. 270\u00ad79, cat.  nos. 1\u00ad33;  SNG  Cop.  Mysia 21\u00ad27). The  ethnic  composition  of  the  population  cannot  be determined  with  certainty.  When  the  Chians  \"bought\" Atarneus  from  Kyros  in  return  for  handing  over  the  refugee Paktyes  (Hdt. 1.160.4),  there  may  have  been  a  non-Greek population  already  dwelling  there,  and  we  do  not  know  if they  were  expelled  by  the  Chian  settlers.  But  Himerius (Orat. 40.6\u00ad7  Arist.  fr. 675,  Rose)  suggests,  for  what  it  is worth,  that  the  process  of  Hellenisation  may  not  have  been complete  even  in  Aristotle's  day.  Himerius,  who  calls Atarneus  a   ,  does  not  indicate  the  origin  of this  anecdote. 804. ", "Magnesia": "Identifier: 822. , (Magnes) Map  56.  Lat. 38.35,long.  27.25.

The  collective  use of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on  Hellenistic  coins (SNG  Cop.  Aeolis 177ff),in  abbreviated  forms  on  coins  of  the Classical  period  (infra),  and  externally  in  the  Athenian  trib- ute  lists  (infra);  the  individual  use  is  attested  externally  in  IG xii.623  (C 4l). Very  little  is  known  about  the  history  of  Elaia.  Herodotos does  not  mention  it  in  his  list  of  original  Aiolian  founda- tions  ( 1.149.1),  and  the  hypothesis  that  Elaia  was  originally known  as  the  otherwise  unattested  Aigiroessa  in  Herodotos' list  is  not  supported  by  any  available  evidence.  The  alterna- tive  explanation  offered  by  B\u00fcrchner  ( 1905),  that  Elaia  was founded  as  an  Athenian  colony  and  therefore  was  never counted  as  a  member  of  the  Aiolian  dodekapolis,  rests  pri- marily  on  the  tradition  that  names  Menestheus  with  his Athenian  troops  as  its  founder  (Strabo  13.3.5;  but  note  that in 13.1.67  he  refers  to  Elaia  as  a  polis  Aiolike). Elaia  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged  to the  Ionian  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  some- times  by  toponym  (IG i\u00b3  266.i.17),  while  in  other  lists  the entries  are  by  the  collective  form  of  the  city-ethnic  (IG i\u00b3 261.iii.4).  It is  recorded  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.i.16,  restored) to 421/20  (IG i\u00b3  285.ii.8\u00ad9)  a  total  of  fifteen times,  once  com- pletely  restored,  paying  in  all  years  a  phoros  of 1,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3 261.iii.4). In C 4l,  Horismos  Damasistratou  of  Elaia  received  proxe- nia  and  citizenship  from  Samos  after  the  restoration  of  the Samians  to  their  island  (IG xii.623).  The  Elaians  made  a communal  dedication  of  a  beardless  image  of  Zeus  at Olympia  (Paus. 5.24.6,  who  does  not  give  a  date). The  site  was  described  by  B\u00fcrchner  ( 1905).The  oldest  city wall  (probably  C 3)  enclosed  an  area  of  c. 6  ha.  An  acropolis was  located  on  the  hill  Maltepe  (Bean  ( 1966)  112\u00ad14).

The  main  rea- son  for  classifying  Myania  as  a  polis  in  the  Archaic  and Classical  periods  is  Thucydides'  information  at  3.101.2  that, in 426,  the  Myonians  had  to  provide  hostages  to  the Peloponnesian  League  alongside  a  number  of  other  Lokrian communities,  three  of  which  were  presumably  poleis (Amphissa  (no. 158),  Chaleion  (no. 159)  and  Oianthea  (no. 166))  and  the  others  of  which  may  have  been.

The  occupation  of  the  hiera chora  at  the  beginning  of  the Fourth  Sacred  War  of 340\u00ad338  (Dem. 18.150;  Aeschin. 3.113) was  followed  by  a  redrawing  of  the  frontier  to  the  detriment of  the  Amphissaians  (Rousset  ( 2002)  86.8.30\u00ad31  (r 335/4)). From  these  Classical  sources,  as  well  as  from  later  docu- ments,  it  appears  that  Amphissa  possessed  a  larger  territory than  the  other  Lokrian  poleis. In 480  Amphissa  served  as  a  place  of  refuge  for  the Phokians  and  the  Delphians  (Hdt. 8.32.2,  36.2).  Amphissa  is then  not  mentioned  again  in  the  sources  until  the Peloponnesian  War  (on  the  reference  to the  Amphissaians  at Diod. 12.42.4  (r 431),  see  Lerat  ( 1952)  ii. 37).  Among  the  West Lokrians,  who  in  426  were  allied  with  Athens,  the Amphissaians  were  the  first t o  change  sides  and  join  the Spartans  (Thuc. 3.101.2).  In  the  Third  Sacred  War,  the Amphissaians  were  prepared  to  relieve  Delphi  from Phokian  occupation  (Diod. 16.24.4  (r 356)),  but  soon  had  to submit  to  the  Phokians  (Diod. 16.33.3  (r 354  or 353)).  The Fourth  Sacred  War  ( 340\u00ad338)  was  provoked  by  the Amphissaians  (Aeschin. 3.113\u00ad29;Dem.  18.140\u00ad59),  and ended  with  Philip's  conquest  of  the  city  (Polyaen. 4.2.8)  and the  exile  of  some  of  the  citizens.  Aeschin. 3.129  states  that  the Amphissaians  recalled  the  exiles  soon  after,  and  had  their opponents  exiled  instead,  but  according  to  Diod. 18.56.5,  the exile  of  the  Amphissaians  who  had  caused  the  Sacred  War was  still  effective  in  319.  However,  in  spite  of  Strabo  9.4.8  (cf. 9.3.4),  it  seems  that  the  city  was  not  destroyed  in  338  (Lerat ( 1952)  ii. 53\u00ad54).  It  is  apparent  from  the  Amphiktyonic  lists of 341\u00ad323  that  Amphissa  was  not  a  member  of  the  C 4m  fed- eration  of  the  Hesperian  Lokrians  which  had  its  centre  at Physkeis  (supra).  During  this  period  an  Amphissaian  and  a Hesperian  took  turns  serving  as  the  hieromnemon  of  the West  Lokrians  (Lerat  ( 1952)  ii. 57\u00ad60;  Lef\u00e8vre ( 1998)  79, 295\u00ad96). west  lokris  393 The  mythical  founder  of  Amphissa  was  Andraimon (Arist.  fr. 569),  whose  tomb  could  still  be  seen  in  Amphissa in  the  second  century  ad  (Paus. 10.38.5).  Nothing  is  known about  the  political  institutions  of  Amphissa  prior  to  C 2.In C 4m  the  Amphissaians  appointed  a  theorodokos  to  host  the theoroi  from  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.195.4). In 321,  when  Amphissa  was  besieged  by  the  Aitolians (Diod. 18.38.2),  the  city  must  have  been  fortified.  There  are still  remains  of  the  ancient  acropolis  wall,  built  partly  in Lesbian  masonry  and  enclosing  an  area  of 1  ha. Furthermore,  excavations  have  revealed  sections  of  what may  be  a  C 4s  defence  circuit  enclosing  the  town (ArchDelt 37 ( 1982)  208\u00ad10,  44  ( 1989)  Chron. 190,  198\u00ad99,  50  ( 1995)  Chron. 358,  51  ( 1996)  Chron. 328. 159.

Apart from  this  treaty--which c oncerns  the  presence  of  Oianthean citizens  in  Chaleion  and  vice  versa--little is known of  the  his- tory  of  Oianthea  in  the  Classical  period.

According  to Plut.  Mor. 294E, the  city  was  founded  by  the  hero  Lokros.  Plutarch's  account may  stem  from  an  Aristotelian  politeia  (no. 104,  Gigon). 167.

Naupaktos  is called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Thuc. 3.102.5  and  Ps.- Skylax 35.For polis  in  the  political  sense,  see  IG ix\u00b2.1  609.10, a  law  of  C 6l,  often  assigned  to  Naupaktos  (Koerner  ( 1993) no. 47),  though  the  ascription  is  far  from  certain  (Nomima i no. 44).  At Thuc. 2.9.1  and 4,  the  Messenians  in  Naupaktos are  subsumed  under  the  heading  poleis  and  listed  among  the allies  of  Athens  in  431.  See  also  Diod. 15.66.5  (r 460/59  or 456/5),12.48.1  (r 429).The  city-ethnic  is  used  in  the  collective and  external  sense  in  IG ix\u00b2.1718.2,  etc.;  IvO 259.1.

The  territory is  called  (Aesch.  Suppl. 262; Thuc. 3.102.2).Its  frontiers  are  virtually  unknown  (see  intro- duction  supra).  In  the  Hellenistic  period  the  Bouttioi,  situ- ated  c. 5  km  north  of  Naupaktos,  are  attested  as  a  dependency of  Naupaktos  (Lerat  ( 1952)  i. 20\u00ad23,  76,  93\u00ad96,  191\u00ad92).  On the  frontier  between  Lokris  and  Aitolia  north  of  Naupaktos, see  supra 391.  An  Archaic  law  on  landed  property (IG ix\u00b2.1 609)  concerns  the  region  of  Naupaktos  or  the  borderland towards  Aitolia,  but  the  ascription  of  the  law  to  the  city  of Naupaktos  is  uncertain  (supra). According  to  Ps.-Skymnos  479,  Naupaktos  was  a  Dorian polis  founded  in  the  Heroic  Age  by  Temenos.  In  C 5f  contin- gents  of  colonists  were  sent  to  Naupaktos  from  East  Lokris and  Chaleion  (no. 159)  (IG ix\u00b2.1718  ML 20  Koerner ( 1993)  no. 47).  In  456/5  the  Athenians  took  Naupaktos  away from  the  West  Lokrians  and  gave  it  to  Messenian  exiles  from the  Peloponnese  (Thuc. 1.103.3;Diod.  11.84.7;  cf. Hornblower ( 1991)  160).  The  Messenians  and  the Naupaktians  formed  a  sympoliteia  (IG ix\u00b2.1  fasc. 3ix;see  also Nielsen  ( 2002)  60  n. 87;  for  a  C 2  echo  of  this  sympoliteia,see SEG 41  331  and  BE 1994  no. 341);  they  won  several  victories: one  over  Kalydon  (no. 148),commemorated  at  Delphi  (BCH 106  ( 1982)  196\u00ad99,  204),  and  one  over  the  Akarnanians  and Oiniadai  (no. 130),  commemorated  in  Olympia  (IvO 259 (C 5l?);  Paus. 5.26.1).  The  Messenians  of  Naupaktos remained  loyal  to  Athens  during  the  Peloponnesian  War (Thuc. 2.9.4;Diod.12.48.1)  and  provided  strong  contingents of  hoplites,  testifying  to  the  large  size  of  the  population  ( 500 hoplites  in  427  (Thuc. 3.75.1),  600  in 410  (Diod. 13.48.6)).  In 400,  after  the  end  of  the  war,  the  Messenians  were  expelled, and  Naupaktos  was  given  back  to  the  Lokrians  (Diod. 14.34.2;  Paus. 4.26.2,  10.38.10).  Twice  in  C 4  Naupaktos became  an  Achaian  dependency,  first between  389  and 367, and  then  again  during  the  Third  Sacred  War  and  down  to 338  (Diod. 15.75.2;Dem.  9.34;  Lerat  ( 1952)  ii. 44\u00ad45,  49).  In that  year  Naupaktos  was  captured  by  Philip  II,  who  killed the  Achaian  garrison  and  gave  the  city  to  the  Aitolians (Theopomp.  fr. 235;Strabo 9.4.7;  cf.  Lerat  ( 1952)  ii. 54\u00ad55; Freitag  ( 2000)  87). IG ix\u00b2.1718  contains  some  information  about  the  Lokrian political  institutions  in  C 5f.  The  inscription  regulates  the status  and  rights  of  the  new  colonists  from  Naupaktos,  men- tions  the  laws  of  Naupaktos,  and  refers  to  an  official called archos,  and  the  agora  as  the  place  where  proclamations  take place.  IG ix\u00b2.1  609  refers  to damiourgoi  and  to  three  types  of assembly:  preiga,  polis  and  apoklesia,  but  the  ascription  to Naukratos  remains  doubtful. The  divinities  attested  in  the  Classical  period  are  Athena Polias  (unpublished  sympoliteia,  cf.  supra)  and  Apollo (Thuc. 2.91.1).  In  C 4m  Naupaktos  appointed  a  theorodokos to  host  theoroi  from  Epidauros  (no. 348)  (IG iv\u00b2.195.6). Naupaktos  is  the  only  Lokrian  city  that  we  know  for  cer- tain  was  fortified in C 5.  Thuc. 3.102.2\u00ad4  distinguishes  an unfortified suburb ( proasteion)  from  the  \"big  wall\"  ( \u00b5 ),  which  ought  to  be  a  wall  enclosing  the  town  below the  acropolis.  The  harbour  seems  to  have  been  fortified t oo (Lerat  ( 1952)  i. 89).Remains  of  the  ancient  fortifications and other  buildings  have  been  unearthed  during  numerous excavations,  but  there  is  not  yet  a  chronologically  organised synthesis  that  indicates  which  of  the  urban  remains  can  be dated  to  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods. 166.

The  inscription,  BCH 92  ( 1968)  30,  which  concerns  the ownership  of  landed  property in  one  polis  by  citizens  from another  polis,  shows  that  Chaleion  bordered  on  Tritea  (no. 168).  The  treaty  with  Oianthea  (IG ix2.1  717)  mentions  the name  of  the  territory ( 1: ) and refers to the harbour of  the  city  ( 4: \u00b5   ~  ). Apart  from  IG ix\u00b2.1718--attesting t o  the  participation  of Chaleion  in  the  C 5f  colonisation  of  Naupaktos  (no. 165)-- the  best  source  for  the  status  of  Chaleion  in  C 5  is  the  treaty with  Oianthea  (no. 166)  IG ix\u00b2.1717;  see  Gauthier  ( 1972) 222\u00ad25,  242\u00ad44,  286\u00ad92).  It regulates  the  presence  of Chaleian  metics  ( 6: \u00b5  ~) in Oianthea,  and  vice versa.  The  inscription  refers  to  proxenoi,  xenodikai, damiourgoi,  and  to  institutions  of  an  aristocratic  type,  e.g. that  jurors  are  to  be  appointed  aristindan.  The  Chaleian board  of  damiourgoi  is  also  attested  in  a  C 5f  dedication  to  an unnamed  hero  (IG ix\u00b2.1720). On  the  basis  of  the  epigraphical  evidence,  Lerat  (( 1952)  i. 198\u00ad205)  has  shown  that  Chaleion  was  situated  at  modern Galaxidi.  The  defence  circuit  at  this  site  encloses  an  area  of 8  ha  and  dates  from  C 4l  or  C 3e  (ibid. 152\u00ad58;  ArchDelt 33 ( 1978)  Chron. 147\u00ad48,  44  ( 1989)  Chron. 201  and 204). 160.  *Hyaia  (Hyaios)  (with  Polis) Map  55.Hyaia  unlocat- ed  and  not  in  Barr.;  Polis  located  at  lat. 38.25,long.  22.05,but see  infra.  Type:  C.  The  toponym  is  `  (Steph.  Byz. 644.4: `,     '.      `.    ( `  at  Thuc. 3.101.2)).In  this  note the  toponym  is  probably  generated  by Stephanos  from  the ethnic  in  Thucydides  and  has  no  authority.  Hyaia  is  attested as  a  polis  in  Hellenistic  sources  only  (infra).  The  collective and  external  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  at  Thuc. 3.101.2; for  the  individual  and  external  use,  see  F.Delphes iii.3221 (C 3l);  SEG 44  438.6  (C 2);  IG ix\u00b2.134.18  (C 2). Among  the  Lokrian  peoples  who  were  in  contact  with  the Spartan  Eurylochos  in  426,  Thucydides  mentions  the Hyaioi,  \"who  did  not  submit  to  giving  hostages  until  he  had taken  their  village  called  Polis\"  ( `     \u00b5    \u00b5    \u00b5 ,3.101.2).This,our only early source,is open to sev- eral  interpretations:  (a)  most  of  the  Hyaians  lived  scattered around  a  single  village  which  they  called  Polis;  (b)  the Hyaians  were  settled  in  a  number  of  villages,  one  of  which was  called  Polis;  (c)  the  Hyaians  were  settled  in  one  town (polis)  plus  one  or  more  villages  (komai),  one  of  which  was called  Polis.  Irrespective  of  which  of  the  three  interpreta- tions  one  prefers,  it  can  be  assumed  that  the  name  Polis  is derived  from  the  term polis  in  the  sense  of  akropolis  (Hansen ( 1996)  36). In  the  Hellenistic  period  the  Hyaioi  and  the  Polieis  were distinct  political  communities,  and  each  was  a  polis:  c. 200  the  `  set  up  a  statue  in  Thermos  (IG ix\u00b2.171a),  in C 3e  a     served  as  hipparch  of  the  Aitolian Federation (IG ix\u00b2.18.12\u00ad13;  cf. 17.5),  and  in  208  the  were  among  those  who  recognised  the  Leukophryeneia  of Magnesia  on  the  Maiander  (I.Magnesia 28.13). If  the  Polieis  of  the  Hellenistic  period  can  be  connected with  the  kome  called  Polis  at  Thuc. 3.101.2,  the  inference  is that  Polis  had  changed  its  status  from  kome  to polis.  A  fur- ther  inference  is  that  the  polis  of  the  Hyaians  did  not  have  its urban  centre  at  the  settlement  which  in  426  was  called  Polis. Lerat (( 1952)  i. 197,  ii. 239)  refrained  from  locating  the Hyaians  and  Polis.  Polis  was  tentatively  located  at  modern 394 rousset Glypha  by Philippson  and  Kirsten  ( 1951)  1391\u00ad96  and  ( 1958) 319  n. 2,636  n. 19;  accepted in Barr.  for  no  good  reason.As  the evidence  stands,  Polis  ought  to  be  left  unlocated. 161.

The  toponym  is  (ML 42 (C 5m)),  in  Linear  B  tu-ri-so  (McArthur  ( 1993)  21\u00ad23).  The city-ethnic  is  (ML 42  (C 5m);  coins,  C 4s\u00adC3f, infra;  Milet. i.3140.36  (c. 259\u00ad250)).

It  is  likely  that Tylisos  should  be  understood  as  one  of  the  poleis.  The  term is  used  in  its  political  sense.  The  earliest  certain  reference  to Tylisos  as  a  polis  occurs  in  the  agreement  of  Miletos           (Milet. i.3140.1,36  (c. 259\u00ad250)). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  the  coins  (C 4s\u00adC3f,  infra),  and  externally  in  the  agree- ment  of  Knosos,  Tylisos  and  Argos  (ML  42  (C 5m);  ML  42A (from  Tylisos)  and  B  (from  Argos)  are  written  in  Argolic, and  so  are  treated  here  as  external).  For  the  individual  use  of the  city-ethnic  there  are  '\u00b5  , proxenos  of  Phokis  (Daulis?)  and  Atrax,  Thessaly  (IG ix.1, 1188 perlman 33.3  (C 3s);  SEG 29  502  (C 3s)),  and  \u00b5 ,  prox- enos  of  Kydonia  (I.Cret. ii.x.1  (C 3)). The  neighbours  of  Tylisos  were  Knosos  to  the  east  and Axos  to  the  west.  During  the  Classical  period  Tylisos  and Knosos  formed  an  alliance  (ML  42  (C 5m)).  The  assembly  of Argos  (  ~) served as the mediator in the resolution of  disputes  between  the  two  poleis  concerning  questions  of war  and  peace  (ML  42A.6\u00ad17;  Merrill ( 1991);  cf.  ML  42:  the text  implies  a  federal  structure  with  a  federal  assembly  called  ~  which  decided  questions  of  war  and  peace; members  included  Tylisos,  Knosos  and  Argos  and  perhaps other  states  as  well  ( \u00b5 ,M L 42B.31\u00ad32);  cf. Gschnitzer  ( 1958)  44\u00ad47:ML  42  is  an  alliance  between Knosos  and  Argos;  Tylisos  is  a  dependency  of  Argos).  The border  between  Knosos  and  Tylisos  (   ) is described  in  this  alliance  (B 26\u00ad29),  and  regulations  con- cerning  property and  trade  are  provided:  (i)  both  poleis  are prohibited  from  absorbing  territory ( ~) belonging to the  other  (B 25\u00ad26);  (ii)  Knosioi  are  prohibited  from  owning land  in  Tylisos  ( \u00b5  '),  although  a  Tylisios  may own  land  in  Knosos  (B 23\u00ad25);  (iii)  export  from  Tylisos  to Knosos  and  from  Knosos  to  Tylisos  is  tax-free;  (iv)  Tylisioi pay  the  same  taxes  as  citizens  of  Knosos  for  trans-shipment from  Knosos  (B 11\u00ad14).  The  \u00b5  appear  as  the  chief  mag- istrates  of  the  polis  and  were responsible  for  providing  for- eign  envoys  with  .The  oversaw  the  \u00b5  (ML 42B.40\u00ad42  (C 5m)). The  polis  town  of  Tylisos  was  presumably  in  the  vicinity  of the  Minoan  town,  but  all  that  remain  of  the  later  settlement are  a  monumental  altar  and  temenos  wall  north-west  of Building (J.  Hadjidaki  ( 1934)  66\u00ad68). Tylisos  struck  coins  (staters)  on  the  Aiginetan  standard during  the  period  c. 330\u00ad280/270  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  197;  IGCH no. 109).  obv.  head  of  Hera;  rev.

The  toponym  is  , (Hdt. 4.151.2).  The  city-ethnic  is  '  (I.Cret. iii.vii.3  (C 6?); coins,  C 4s\u00adC3f,  infra). The  earliest  reference  to  Itanos  as  a  polis  in  the  urban sense  occurs  in  Herodotos'  narrative  of  the  foundation  of Kyrene  (Hdt. 4.151.2  (rC 7)).  Messengers  from  Thera  arrived   .The earliest uses of  the  term  in  its  political sense  occur  in  Hellenistic  inscriptions  (I.Cret. iii.iv.2\u00ad3 (c. 266/5\u00ad263/2),  8  (C 3f)). The  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  an  Archaic rupestral  inscription  written  boustrophedon  in  the  epichor- ic  alphabet  (I.Cret. iii.vii.3  (C 6?)).  It  is  unclear  whether  the use  is  individual  or  collective.  The  first c ertain  example  of the  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  internally  occurs  on  the coins  (C 4s\u00adC3f,  infra)  and  externally  in  an  Archaic  law  of Lyktos  (SEG 35  991A  (C 6l);  cf.  Faure  ( 1993)  69\u00ad70).  For  the individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  there  is  the  signature  of  the sculptor  \u00b5   \u00b5 '  (I.Cret. iii.iii.31  (C 3/C2)). Apart  from  a  possible  reference  to  hostilities  with  Lyktos (SEG 35  991A  (C 6l);  cf.  Faure  ( 1993)  69\u00ad70),  all  evidence  for the  foreign  relations  of  Itanos  is  Hellenistic. Apart  from  the  story  of  the  participation  of  the  Itanian purple-fisher,  Korobios,  in  Thera's  colonisation  of  Kyrene (Hdt. 4.151\u00ad53  (rC 7))  and  the  possible  reference  to  hostilities crete  1167 with  Lyktos  (supra),  evidence  for  the  foreign  relations  of Itanos  is  Hellenistic.  The  presence  of  pottery  from  Corinth (C 7e\u00adC6e),  Attika  (C 6f\u00adC4,  but  nothing  from  c. 470\u00ad420), Ionia,  Paros(?),  Knosos  (Orientalising  and  Hellenistic), Eleutherna  (Orientalising  and  Hellenistic)  and  Aphrati attests  Itanos' participation  in  intra-island  and Mediterranean  trading  networks,  but  is  not  sufficient t o demonstrate  direct  relations  with  any  one  of  these  places (Greco  et al.( 1999);  Tsingarida  ( 2001)). The  Itanians  distinguished  between  their  territory  on Crete  itself  ( ) and several small islands which they claimed,  the  most  important  of  which  was  (probably modern  Kouphonisi)  (I.Cret. iii.iv.8  ll. 9\u00ad11  (C 3f),  9  ll. 37\u00ad39 and  passim  (C 2l)).The  Magnesian  arbitration  of  the  dispute between  Itanos  and  Hierapytna  describes  the  southern  bor- der  of  Itanos  (I.Cret. iii.iv.9  ll. 59\u00ad67  (C 2l)).The  sanctuary  of Zeus  Diktaios  at  Palaikastro  was  located  near  this  border (Chaniotis  ( 1988);  cf.  Perlman  ( 1995a)).  For  the  extent  of  the territory  of  Itanos  (from  the  sanctuary  of  Zeus  Diktaios  in the  south  to  the  sanctuary  of  Athena  Samonia  on  Cape Sideros  to  the  north),  see  Kalpaxis  et al.( 1995). The  polis  town  of  Itanos  was  built  on  two  small  acropolis- es,  the  eastern  acropolis  (altitude  24.35  m)  and  the  western acropolis  (altitude  17.45  m).  A  large  hill  (altitude  61  m) delimits  the  plain  of  Itanos  to  the  south.  Public  buildings  are likely  to  have  been  located  on  the  two  small  acropolises.  The east  acropolis  may  have  been  fortified.  A  monumental  ter- race  on  the  west  acropolis  was  probably  built  to  accommo- date  a  temple.  A  rectangular  basin  of  roughly  80\u00ad90  m (east\u00adwest)  by  50\u00ad60  m  (north\u00adsouth),  possibly  an  ancient harbour,  has  been  identified immediately t o  the  south  of  the two  acropolises.  The  agora  may  have  been  just  to  the  north of  the  harbour  more  or  less  between  the  two  acropolises. The  southern  hill  was  protected  by  a  fortification wall w ith towers.  The  western  line  of  this  fortification may have extended  north  beyond  the  hill  to  defend  the  harbour  and the  two  acropolises.  The  polis  town  is  estimated  to  have covered roughly  40  ha.  A  large,  roughly  trapezoidal  building with  a  central  hearth  in  the  main  room,  tentatively  identi- fied as an andreion,  was  built  in  the  Archaic  period  (aban- doned  C 5f)  in  the  area  of  a  Geometric  cemetery  on  a  low  hill to  the  north  of  the  acropolises  (Viviers  ( 2001)).  During  the late  Classical  period  a  cemetery  was  established  on  a  terrace east  of  the  Archaic  building.  Apart  from  the  Archaic  build- ing,  all  other  walls  in  the  polis  town  (fortification,  building and  terrace)  appear  to  be  Hellenistic  and  later,  but  pottery from  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  is  reported  from  the east  acropolis,  the  Hellenistic  and  later  residential  quarter  in the  saddle  between  the  two  akropolises,  and  the  rural  sanc- tuary  and  temple  (of  Demeter?)  at  \u00b5.  See  Gallett  de Santerre ( 1951);  Deschayes  ( 1951);  Kalpaxis  et al.( 1995); Greco et al.( 1996),  ( 1997),  ( 1998a),  ( 1998b),  ( 1999). Itanos  began  to  strike  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard c. 380.  Subsequent  issues  are  sporadic  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  196; Kraay  ( 1976)  53\u00ad54).  The  earliest  coins  (staters  and  obols, c. 380\u00ad320)  have  obv.  marine  deity;  rev.  star  (Svoronos  ( 1890) pl.  XVIII. 21\u00ad36,  with  Le Rider  ( 1966)  196;  SNG  Cop.

Itanos  continued  to  mint this  latter  type  (obv.  marine  deity;  rev.  opposing  sea  mon- sters;  legend: or) during the period c. 320\u00ad280/270  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pl.

Ps.-Skylax 47  identifies Olous as a  \u00b5.  Two  inscrip- tions  of  C 3m  provide  the  earliest  references  to  Olous  as  a polis  in  the  political  sense  (Milet. i.3140.1,  38  (c. 259\u00ad250); I.Cret. i.xxii.4A  ii,  vii).  The  earliest  attestation  of  the  term  in the  urban  sense  occurs  in  SEG 23.547  (C 3l/C2e).  There  is  no doubt  that  Olous  was  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  by  the  early Hellenistic  period.  The  archaeological  evidence  indicates that  settlement  on  the  isthmus  of  Poros  was  established  perhaps  as  early  as  the  Archaic  period  (infra).  Although  no public  buildings  of  the  Classical  period  have  been  identified, the  combined  evidence  of  her  Archaic  foundation,  the  pos- sibility  that  her  mint  began  to  strike  coins  as  early  as  c. 330 and  her  status  as  a  polis  at  the  beginning  of  the  Hellenistic period  warrants  her  inclusion  in  the  Inventory  as  a  probable polis  (type  B)  . The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  occurs  internally  on the  coins  (infra)  and  in  proxeny  decrees  (e.g.  I.Cret. 1178 perlman i.xxii.4A.21\u00ad22  (C 3m)).The  earliest  attestation  of  the  collec- tive  use  of  the  city-ethnic  externally  occurs  in  Milet. i.3 140.38  (c. 259\u00ad250).  For  the  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic there  is  the  graffito of  \u00b5  [ '] from  the  Memnonion  at  Abydos  (Memnonion 125,  298 (C 3)). The  Hellenistic  borders  of  Olous  are  described  in  several treaties  (all  C 2l)  between  Olous  and  her  neighbour  Lato (I.Cret. i.xvi.18;  R\u00c9A 44  ( 1942)  35\u00ad36C.51\u00ad56;  SEG 26 1049.62\u00ad66;  I.Cret. i.xvi.5.69\u00ad72;  for  discussions  of  these descriptions,  see  Faure  ( 1972);  van  Effenterre  and  Bougrat ( 1969);  for  the  historical  context,  see  Chaniotis  ( 1996) 318\u00ad32).The  border  with  Lato  was  described  as  \"old\"  (SEG 26 1049.60\u00ad62:[ ]  [  ]    [ ];R\u00c9A44 ( 1942)  35\u00ad36C.51\u00ad52:         ).One of  the  landmarks  on  the  border  between  Lato and  Olous  was        (I.Cret. i.xvi.18.7\u00ad8; SEG 26  1049.63\u00ad64;  I.Cret. i.xvi.5.70),  identified w ith  the early  sanctuary  (Protogeometric?,  Geometric?)  at  Sta  Lenika (Bousquet  ( 1938);  Mazarakis  Ainian  ( 1997)  215\u00ad16).  The  size of  the  territory  of  Olous  in  the  Hellenistic  period  is  estimat- ed  to  have  been  c. 26  km \u00b2  (van  Effenterre  ( 1992b)). The  polis  town  of  Olous,  which  was  located  on  the  isth- mus  of  Poros  (van  Effenterre  ( 1992b);for  a  map  of  the  region of  Olous,  see  van  Effenterre  ( 1948c)  pl.  XXVIII),  is  today largely  submerged.  The  earliest  evidence  for  the  settlement on  the  isthmus  is  Archaic  (Favissa  \"votive  pit\"  with  Archaic and  Classical  terracotta  figurines,  van  Effenterre  ( 1992b)).A Submycenaean  cemetery  was  excavated  at  stous  Traphous  to the  south-west  of  Poros  (van  Effenterre  ( 1948c)).  A  fort ( ,SEG  23  548  (C 2);  van  Effenterre  ( 1948b))  and  the sanctuary  of  Britomartis  (van  Effenterre  ( 1992b))  were probably  situated  to  the  east  of  Poros  on  the  Spinalonga peninsula. The  protecting  deity  of  Olous  seems  to  have  been  Zeus Tallaios  (coins,  infra;  oath  god,  e.g.  SEG 23  547  (C 3l/C2e); public  enactments  displayed  in  his  sanctuary,  e.g.  I.Cret. i.xxii.4C  (C 2)).  The  location  of  this  sanctuary  and  of  the prytaneion  (I.Cret. i.xvi.5  (C 2l))  are  not  known.  In  so  far  as  a prytaneion  is  attested  elsewhere  on  Crete  during  the Classical  period  (see  Lato,  infra),  it  is  possible  that  also  at Olous  it  was  pre-Hellenistic.  A  single  C 6  tholos  tomb  was found  to the  north  of  Poros  at  Ammoudoplaka  (ArchDelt 21 ( 1966)  Chron. 407),  and  tombs  and  grave  stelai  of  C 4  and later  have  been  found  to  the  north-west  of  Poros  in  the vicinity  of  the  village  of  Schisma  (ArchDelt 33  ( 1978)  Chron. 389\u00ad90;  43  ( 1988)  Chron. 567\u00ad70)  and  at  Chardaloupas (ArchDelt 38  ( 1978)  Chron. 3376).  Guard-posts  (date?)  pro- tecting  the  urban  centre  of  Olous  from  the  west  (direction  of Dreros),  the  north  (direction  of  Milatos)  and  south  (direc- tion  of  Lato)  were  located  on  the  north  slope  and  summit  of Mt.  Oxa  and  to  the  north  at  stis  Pin\u00e8s  (van  Effenterre ( 1948b)).  Surface  remains  on  the  summit  of  Mt.  Oxa  (per- haps  used  as  a  place  of  refuge  by  the  inhabitants  of  the  polis?) indicate  continuous  human  presence  there  from  LM iiiC  to the  Byzantine  period  (Nowicki  ( 2000)  173\u00ad74).  A  graffito at stis  Pin\u00e8s  (date?)  records  that  the  spot  is  28  stades  from  the polis,      ,  the  correct  distance from  the  guard-post  to  the  isthmus  of  Poros  (van  Effenterre ( 1948b);  cf.  SEG 45  1407  bis). Although  the  phylai  are  attested  only  in  Hellenistic sources,  they  are  likely  to  be  early  and  so  are  mentioned  here. Two  tribal  names  are  preserved  in  the  dating  formulas  of  a public  enactments:  (i)  \u00b5 [\u00b5] (I.Cret. i.xxii.8  (C 2));  (ii)  \u00b5  (SEG 41  770  (C 2l)). Olous  struck  coins  (staters,  hemidrachms,  obols)  on  the Aiginetan  standard  during  the  period  c. 330\u00ad280/270.  Types: obv.  (all  denominations)  head  of  Artemis;  rev.

The city-ethnic  is  (Milet. i.3140.37  (c. 259\u00ad250)). The  urban  centre  of  the  community  of  the  Petraioi  has been  identified w ith  the  fortified acropolis site (Archaic\u00adClassical)  on  the  north  coast  of  Crete  west  of  Siteia at  Liopetra  (Faure  ( 1963)  20\u00ad21;  for  description,  see  Nowicki ( 2000)  101\u00ad2). The  only  ancient  reference  to the  community  of  the Petraioi  as  a  polis  occurs  in  the  agreement  of  Miletos            (Milet. i.3140.1,37  (c. 259\u00ad250)). The  Petraioi  are  included  in  the  Inventory  as  a  possible  polis (type  C)  on  the  strength  of  this  reference--which assures that  their  community  was  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  the early  Hellenistic  period--combined w ith  the  archaeological evidence  for  the  Archaic\u00adClassical  settlement  with  its  forti- fied acropolis. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally in  Milet. i.3140.37.  It  is  worth  noting  the  Gortynian,  ,  who  was  made  proxenos  and  polites of  Olous  (I.Cret. i.xxii.4A  (C 3f)).  His  patronym  may  attest some  association  between  his  family  and  Petra. Bronze  coins  (date?)  with  trident  and  dolphin  have  been attributed  to  the  Petraioi  (Faure  ( 1963)  20\u00ad21). crete  1179 980. ", "Praisos": "Identifier: 985. , (Praisios) Map  60.  Lat. 35.10,long.  26.05. Size of  territory: 3.  Type:  [A].  The  toponym  is   (I.Cret. iii.iv.1  (C 3e)).  The  city-ethnic  is  (coins, C 4s\u00adC3f,infra;  I.Cret. iii.iv.1  (C 3e)).For  /, see  Guarducci  ( 1942)  135. In  Ps.-Skylax 47,  where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense, Praisos  is  one  of  the  toponyms  listed  under  the  heading      .  The  earliest  explicit  uses  of  the term for  Praisos  occur  in  Hellenistic  documents (I.Cret. iii.iv.1  (C 3e),vi.7  (C 3f)).Although  there  is  no  explic- it  Archaic  or  Classical  reference  to Praisos  as  a  polis,her mint,  which  perhaps  began  as  early  as  c. 350,  strongly  sug- gests  her  inclusion  in  the  Inventory  as  a  polis. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  the  coins  (infra)  and  in  a  decree  of  Praisos  for  the  Stalitai (I.Cret. iii.vi.7  (C 4s\u00adC3f,  C 3f)).  The  collective use  is  attested externally  in  Herodotos'  account  of  the  expedition  of  Minos to  Sicily  (Hdt. 7.170.1). The  Praisioi  maintained  that  they  were  descendants  of  the autochthonous  Eteocretans  (Hdt. 7.170\u00ad71;  Staphylos (FGrHist 269)  fr. 12;  Whitley  ( 1998)).  The  tradition  is  sup- ported  by  the  discovery  at  Praisos  of  five E teocretan  inscrip- tions,  the  earliest  of  which  (I.Cret. iii.vi.1;  cf. 4)  may  date  to C 6  (Jeffery ( 1990)  316  nos. 19a  and  b  ( 550\u00ad525?)).If  so,  it  con- siderably  antedates  the  earliest  identifiably G reek  inscrip- tion  from  Praisos  (I.Cret.  III.vi. 7  (C 3e);  Guarducci  ( 1942) 137;  Duhoux  ( 1982)  63\u00ad85).  Apart  from  the  role  of  the Praisioi  in  the  Cretan  refusal  to  join  the  Greek  cause  against Xerxes,  which  is  suggested  by  the  narrative  of  Herodotos (Hdt. 7.170\u00ad71),  our  evidence  for  the  history  of  the  polis  is Hellenistic. The  phrase     was  used  to  denote  a  citizen (I.Cret. iii.iv.1  (C 3e)).  The  name  of  one  phyle, , preserved  in  the  dating  formula  of  an  honorary  decree (I.Cret. iii.vi.8  (C 3)),  is  a  rare  feminine  adjectival  form  of unknown derivation  (Jones,  POAG 231). The  territory  of  Praisos  was  called  ( ) (Theophr.  Hist.  pl. 3.3.4;  I.Cret. iii.iv.1  (C 3e)).  The  statement of  Ps.-Skylax  47  that  \"Praisos  reached  in  both  directions\" (     \u00b5) has been understood to mean  to  the  north  and  the  south  coasts  (e.g.Whitley  ( 1998)). Such  an  interpretation  is  supported  by the  decree  of  Praisos for  the  Stalitai  (and  Setaetai)  which  suggests  that  these  two coastal  communities  (the  Stalitai  on  the  south  coast  and Setaetai  on  the  north  coast)  were dependencies  of  Praisos during  the  Hellenistic  period  (I.Cret. iii.vi.7  (C 3f); Chaniotis  ( 1996)  385\u00ad94;  Perlman  ( 1996)  257\u00ad58). The  polis  town  of  Praisos  was  built  on  three  acropolises (First  Acropolis,  Second  Acropolis  and  Third  Acropolis  or Altar  Hill)  and  covered  an  area  of  roughly  24  ha.  Settlement began  there  (on  First  and  Second  Acropolises)  already  in crete  1183 LM iiiC  and  continued  through  C 2s.  The  main  period  of occupation  was  C 5l\u00adC2m  (Whitley  et al.( 1995)  428). An  early  shrine  (Geometric\u00adHellenistic)  was  located  on  the  summit  of  Third  Acropolis,  and  a  temple (Classical\u00adHellenistic)  on  the  summit  of  First  Acropolis. Staphylos  records  the  existence  of  a  temple  of  Zeus  Diktaios at  Praisos  (Staphylos  (FGrHist 269)  fr. 12).  The  question remains  open  whether  this  temple  should  be  identified w ith the  one  on  First  Acropolis  or  with  the  temple  and  sanctuary of  Zeus  Diktaios  at  Palaikastro  on  the  east  coast  of Crete  (Perlman  ( 1995a)).  Extra-urban  spring  sanctuaries were  located  to  the  south  of  the  urban  centre  at  Vavelli  (Orientalising\u00adHellenistic)  and  Mesamvrysi (Geometric\u00adArchaic  and  possibly  later).  A  third  extra- urban  sanctuary  (Orientalising\u00adHellenistic)  with  an  associ- ated  C 6s  kiln  has  been  identified on the summit of  Prophitis Elias, 2.5  km  south-east  of  the  polis  town  (Whitley  et al. ( 1999)  249\u00ad51;  cf.  Erickson  ( 2000)  318\u00ad27).  Residential  areas are  indicated  by  rock-cut  features  on  the  slopes  of  First  and Second  Acropolises.  A  multi-room  structure  of  the Hellenistic  period  identified as a house or an andreion  was located  in  the  saddle  between  First  and  Second  Acropolis.  If this  structure  was  an  andreion  (for  the  identification of  the structure  as  a  public  building,  see  Bosanquet  ( 1902)  259\u00ad70), the  organisation  of  Praisos  paralleled  that  of  other  Cretan poleis  whose  public  buildings  occupied  the  saddle  connect- ing  a  double  acropolis.  The  main  cemetery  (Late Geometric\u00adHellenistic)  was  located  on  the  south-eastern slopes  of  Third  Akropolis.  For  a  description  of  the  remains, see  Whitley  et al.( 1995),  ( 1999). Praisos  struck  coins  (staters,  drachms,  hemidrachms)  on the  Aiginetan  standard  from  C 4m  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  197 (c. 350\u00ad325)).  Staters  have  types:  obv.  Gorgoneion,  or quadruped  suckling  a  human  infant,  or  Herakles  kneeling; rev.  (with  Gorgoneion  and  quadruped):  Herakles  kneeling; rev.  (with  Herakles):  eagle;  legend: ,  or .  Drachms  have:  obv.  male  figure;  rev.  Herakles kneeling.  Hemidrachms  have  obv.  Herakles  kneeling;  rev. eagle  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pl.  XXVII. 1\u00ad10;  SNG Cop.  Aeg.Isl. 539).  Staters  of  C 4l\u00adC3e  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  197)  have:  (i)  obv. head  of  a  goddess  (Guarducci  ( 1942)  137:  Demeter  or Persephone?);  rev.  bull;  (ii)  obv.Zeus  aetophoros;  rev.

Byz. 399.3).The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic is  attested  internally  in  abbreviated  form  on  the  coins  of C 4m  (infra).  Ancient  Kytaion  has  not  been  securely  located. The  ancient  geographers  place  Kytaion  to  the  west  of Apellonia  (Plin.  HN 4.59;  Ptol.  Geog. 3.17.6).  Stefanakis  sug- gests  a  location  on  the  small  bay  just  north  of  the  modern village  of  Sisses  at  Almyrida,  where  remains  dating  to  the Neolithic,  Minoan,  Hellenistic  and  Roman  periods  have been  identified as w ell  as  traces  of  an  ancient  harbour (Stefanakis  ( 1998)).  Alexiou  identifies the settlement at Almyrida  as  an  otherwise  unattested  ancient  toponym  *Sisa on  the  basis  of  the  discovery  there  of  an  altar  which  bears  the inscription  (ArchDelt 21  ( 1966)  Chron. 407\u00ad8;  cf. Stefanakis  ( 1998)  99\u00ad100:  a  tribal  name  or  a  neighbouring minor  settlement). The  only  ancient  source  to  identify  Kytaion  as  a  polis  is Stephanos  (Steph.  Byz. 399.3).  Nonnos  Dion. 13.238  calls Kytaion  a  town,   .  A  small  issue  (only three  known  examples)  of  overstruck  silver  staters  dating  to the  period  c. 350\u00ad325  has  been  attributed  to  Kytaion  (Hill ( 1927)  46  pl.  VI. 4,  with  Stefanakis  ( 1998)).  Types:  obv. wreathed  male  head  facing  r.;  rev.  tripod;  legend: (Hill ( 1927)  46  pl.  VI. 4).  The  coins,  which  may  begin  as  early  as c. 350,  suggest  that  Kytaion  was  a  polis  in  the  late  Classical  peri- od  and  so  recommend  her  inclusion  in  the  Inventory  as  a probable  polis  (type  B).  They  share  the  obverse  and  reverse types  of  Axos.  Stefanakis  interprets  this  as  evidence  of  an alliance  between  the  two  poleis  (ibid.).  Almyrida  provides  the most  convenient  coastal  access  for  Axos.  If  Kytaion  was  indeed located  at  Almyrida,  it  seems  likely  that  not  long  after  the minting  of  these  coins  Axos  absorbed  this  small  polis  (ibid.). 970.

The  earliest  attestation  of  Lappa  as  a  polis  in  the  political sense  occurs  in  an  asylia  decree  of  Lappa  for  Teos  (I.Cret. ii.xvi.3  (C 3l)).  For  the  earliest  reference  to  Lappa  as  a  polis  in the  topographical  sense,  see  Polyb. 4.54.4\u00ad5  (r 221\u00ad219). Lappa  is  included  in  the  Inventory  as  a  probable  polis  (type B)  because  (i)  the  earliest  coins  of  Lappa  may  date  to  c. 330 (infra),  and  (ii)  there  was  a  territory  called   already  in  C 4  (Ps.-Skylax  47;  Theophr.  Hist.  pl. 2.6.9). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  the  coins  (infra),  and  externally  in  the  asylia  decree  for Tenos  (I.Cret. ii.xvi.2  (C 3f)).  For  the  individual  use,  there  is the  decree  of  Tenos  honouring     \u00b5 and  other  Cretans  (IG xii.5  suppl. 304  (C 3m)). A  fragment  of  an  Archaic  inscription  from  Lappa  may preserve  the  only  documentary  evidence  from  Crete  for  the basileus, [---]  (I.Cret. ii.xvi.1  (C 5e)).Otherwise  all evidence  for  the  political  institutions  of  Lappa  is  Hellenistic. The  territory of  Lappa,  the  only  polis  situated  at  the  nar- row  isthmus  ( 18  km  wide)  of  west  Crete,  may  have  extended from  the  north  coast  to  the  south  coast,  as  suggested  by  Ps.- Skylax 47: \u00b5  (sc. )     \u00b5.  Two  settlements  on  the  north  coast  proba- bly  lay  within  the  territory of  Lappa:  (i)  `\u00b5,probably located  near  the  modern  village  of  Dramia  at  the  mouth  of the  river  Mousella  (Guarducci  ( 1939)  183),  and  (ii) \u00b5\u00b5,  located  in  the  vicinity  of  the  modern  village  of Giorgioupoli  at  the  mouth  of  the  river  Almyros  (Guarducci ( 1939)  183).  Stephanos  ( 90.9\u00ad11),  quoting  Xenion  ((FGrHist 460)  fr. 12;  cf.  Stadiasmus 346)  identified A mphimala  as  a polis,  whereas  Strabo  called  it  a  (Strabo  10.4.3). According  to  Strabo,  Phoinix  was  located  within  the  territ- ory  of  Lappa  on  the  south  coast  of  Crete  (Strabo  10.4.3). Guarducci  locates  Phoinix  a  few  kilometres  to  the  west  of modern  Sellia  (Guarducci  ( 1939)  192).  This  Phoinix  is  not  to be  confused  with  the  homonymous  port  at  modern  Loutro, some 26  km  to  the  west.  Finally,  it  is  worth  noting  that  the only  freshwater  lake  on  the  island  of  Crete,  Lake  Kournas (the  ancient  \u00b5 ),probably lay within the terri- tory of  Lappa  (Steph.  Byz. 374.12\u00ad15;  Guarducci  ( 1939)  192). The  archaeological  remains  of  ancient  Lappa  extend chiefly o ver  the  hill  that  is  bounded  by  the  rivers  Mousella and  Petre,  on  the  site  of  modern  Argyropoli.  The  earliest  1172 perlman evidence  of  habitation  dates  to  the  early  Geometric  period. Apart  from  stretches  of  the  pseudo-isodomic  Hellenistic fortification walls,  very  little  of  the  ancient  settlement  is  vis- ible  today  (Sanders  ( 1982)  163  ( 14/1)).  The  agora  may  have been  located  at  \"Lephou\",  where  three  marble  statues  of  the Roman  period  were  found  (ArchDelt 15  ( 1933\u00ad35)  66\u00ad70). Lappa  struck  coins  (staters,  drachms,  obols)  on  the Aiginetan  standard  during  the  period  c. 330\u00ad280/270.Types (stater):  obv.  head  of  a  nymph  or  goddess  (Guarducci  ( 1939) 194,  Artemis?);  legend: written  retrograde; rev.  Apollo  kitharodos,  seated;  legend: (Brett ( 1974)  no. 1282,  with  Le Rider  ( 1966)  190,  198).  Types (drachm  and  obol):  obv.  same  as  stater,  or  frontal  bull's  head with  one  horn  curving  down;  rev.  frontal  bull's  head  with one  horn  curving  down,  or  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pl. XIX. 28\u00ad30,  33;  SNG  Cop.  Aeg.Isl. 479).  Early  travellers  to Crete  noted  the  existence  of  silver  mines  (and  gold  and lead?)  in  the  vicinity  of  Lappa,  from  which  probably  derives the  name  of  the  modern  village  on  the  site  of  ancient  Lappa, Argyropoli  or  \"Silverado\"  (Le Rider  ( 1966)  260;  cf.  Markoe ( 1998)  238). 971.Lato  (Latios) Map  60.  Lat. 35.10,long.  25.40.  Size  of territory: 2.  Type:  B.  The  toponym  is  (I.Cret. i.xvi.1 (C 3l)); on  the  coins  is  genitive  (Svoronos  ( 1890) 220.5,  7).  The  city-ethnic  (Milet. i.3140.38 (c. 259\u00ad250))  suggests  an  alternative  thematic  stem  for  the toponym  (Bile  ( 1988)  202  n. 185).  A  second  community  of Latioi,  called   /   \u00b5,  was  estab- lished  on  the  coast  in  the  vicinity  of  Ag.  Nikolaos  by  C 3l (I.Cret. i.xvi.15  (C 3l),  19  (C 2e)).  The  precise  political  nature of  this  community  and  its  relationship  to  \"upper\"Lato, 5  km to  the  south-west,  remain  uncertain  (Perlman  ( 1995b) 133\u00ad35;  Chaniotis  ( 1996)  104\u00ad8,  428\u00ad29:  sympoliteia).  I.Cret. i.xvi.15  and i.xvi.2  seem  to preserve  identical  asylia  decrees for  Teos  save  that  the  former  has  as  its  heading   \u00b5  while  the  latter  has  .  I.Cret. i.xvi.19 is  too  fragmentary  to  draw  any  conclusions  about  its  con- tents.  All  other  inscriptions  pertaining  to  Lato  refer  only  to    without  drawing  any  distinction  between  two different  groups  of  Latioi.  Stephanos  provides  an  entry  for \u00b5  but  not  for  (Steph.  Byz. 351.1\u00ad2).  Xenion, Stephanos'  source,  identifies  \u00b5  as  a  Cretan  polis which  was  also  called  Lato,     (Xenion (FGrHist 460)  fr. 7). The  earliest  reference  to  Lato  as  a  polis  in  the  political sense  occurs  in  the  first line of  the  agreement  of  Miletos          (Milet. i.3140.1,  38 ( 259\u00ad250)).  The  prytaneion  has  been  dated  to  C 4s  (infra),  as have  several  other  public  buildings  at  Lato.  This  suggests that  Lato  should  be  numbered  among  the  Classical,  if  not the  Archaic,  poleis  (type  B)  of  Crete  despite  the  fact  that  the evidence  for  the  political  status  of  the  community  dates  no earlier  than  C 3. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  the  treaty  between  Lato  and  Hierapytna  (I.Cret. i.xvi.16 (C 3l))  and  externally  in  Milet. i.3140.38  (c. 259\u00ad250).  It  is worth  noting  that  the  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  not attested  for  Lato,  with  the  possible  exception  of  an  entry  of Stephanos,  who  adduces   ,  Alexander's commander,  as  an  example  of  the  ethnic  of  Makedonian (Steph.  Byz. 413.21).  Nearchos  was  a  Cretan  (Arr.  Ind. 10,  18.4),  perhaps  from  Lato  if  we  may  so  interpret  the  pas- sage  from  Stephanos. Although  the  phylai  appear  only  in  Hellenistic  sources, they  are  likely  to  be  early  and  so  are  mentioned  here.  Four tribal  names  are  attested  (all  in  inscriptions  of  C 2s):  (i) (BCH 62  ( 1938)  405\u00ad8  no. 4;  I.Cret i.xvi.29,  30);  (ii) '  (I.Cret. i.xvi.25,  31,  34);  (iii)  (BCH 62 ( 1938)  390  no. 1);  (iv)  `  (I.Cret i.xvi.26,  32;  SEG 32 895). Several  treaties  (all  C 2l)  describe  the  Hellenistic  borders (a  circuit  of  c. 66  km)  of  Lato  and  her  neighbours  (I.Cret. i.xvi.18;  REA 44  ( 1942)  35\u00ad36C.49\u00ad56;  SEG 26  1049.52\u00ad82; I.Cret. i.xvi.5.51\u00ad72;  for  discussion,  see  Faure  ( 1972);  van Effenterre  and  Bougrat  ( 1969);  for  the  context,  see  Chaniotis ( 1996)  318\u00ad32).  The  borders  are  twice  described  as  \"old\"  (SEG 26  1049.60\u00ad62:[ ]  [  ]  [ ];  REA 44  ( 1942)  35\u00ad36C.51\u00ad52:             ).One of  the  landmarks on  the  border  between  Lato  and  Olous  was      (I.Cret. i.xvi.18.  7\u00ad8;  SEG 26  1049.63\u00ad64;  I.Cret. i.xvi.5.70),  identified w ith  the  early  sanctuary (Protogeometric?,  Geometric?)  at  Sta  Lenika  (Bousquet ( 1938);  Mazarakis  Ainian  ( 1997)  215\u00ad16). The  polis  town  of  Lato  was  built  on  a  double  acropolis ( 300\u00ad400  m).  Residential  areas  were  located  on  the  terraced slopes  of  both  hills.  The  public  buildings  were  located  in  the saddle  between  the  two.  This  area  has  come  to  be  called  the agora,  although  the  term  is  not  attested  epigraphically  at Lato.  In  the  centre  of  the  agora  at  the  lowest  point  of  the  sad- dle  there  is  a  cistern  and  a  small  shrine.  A  Doric  stoa  delim- its  the  agora  to  the  west,  and  a  rectangular  exedra  marks  the boundary  to  the  south.  A  broad  flight of  steps  to  the  north leads  up  to  the  prytaneion  complex  (Ducrey  and  Picard ( 1972)).  The  steps  accommodate  c. 180  standing  or  c. 80 crete  1173 seated  persons  and  may  have  been  used  as,  e.g.,  a  dikasterion (Hansen  and  Fischer-Hansen  ( 1994)  63).  To  the  south-east of  the  central  area  and  at  a  higher  elevation  there  is  a  theatre or  theatral  area  (Ducrey  and  Picard  ( 1971))  accommodating c. 350  persons  and  sometimes  interpreted  as  an  ekklesiasteri- on  (cf.  Hansen  and  Fischer-Hansen  ( 1994)  65).  The  main temple  of  the  polis  town  is  located  on  a  terrace  above  the  the- atral  area  (Ducrey  and  Picard  ( 1970)).  The  identity  of  the deity  worshipped  there  is  not  known.  The  protecting  deity of  Lato  seems  to  have  been  Eleuthyia,  in  whose  sanctuary public  documents  were  displayed  (e.g.  I.Cret. i.xvi.2,  15 (C 3l)).The  location  of  her  sanctuary  is  not  known.  The  polis town  was  defended  by the  terrain,  by defence  walls  and  by \"fortress-houses\"  (J.  Demargne  ( 1901);  Hadjimichali  ( 1971); Ducrey  and  Picard  ( 1996)).  Water  was  supplied  by  public and  private  cisterns  (Hadjimichali  ( 1971)).  The  principal entrance  to  the  polis  town  was  from  the  south-west,  where  a road  passes  through  the  main  gate  and  then  branches  to  the west  and  to  the  east.  The  eastern  branch  leads  to  the  agora and  then  continues  along  the  edge  of  the  saddle  to  the north-east  (Tir\u00e9  and  van  Effenterre  ( 1978)).  The  buildings described  above  appear  to  date  to  C 4s\u00adC3e.  Evidence  for earlier  occupation  includes  the  east  terrace  of  the  agora (C 7),Archaic  figurines from beneath the shrine in the agora, and  a  potter's  workshop  (c. 650\u00ad625)  located  beneath  the  ter- race  of  the  main  temple  (Ducrey  and  Picard  ( 1969)).  Also Archaic  is  the  extra-urban  sanctuary  (C 8m\u00adC3)  on  Mt. Thilakas,  located  1.5  km  south-east  of  the  polis  town (Reinach  ( 1913)).  For  general  descriptions,  see  Tir\u00e9  and  van Effenterre  ( 1978)  98\u00ad105;  Ducrey  and  Picard  ( 1976);  Picard ( 1992);  for  a  plan  of  the  remains,  see  J.  Demargne  ( 1901)  pl. XX.  The  settlement  of  /   \u00b5  at  Ag. Nikolaos  remains  largely  unknown  archaeologically  save  for its  cemeteries  (Davaras  ( 1978)). Lato  struck  coins  on  the  Attic  standard  in  C 3l  (Picard ( 1990);  Guarducci  ( 1935)  108;  SNG  Cop.  Aeg.Isl. 484\u00ad86). 972.Lebena  (Lebenaios) Map  60.  Lat. 34.55,long.  24.55. Size of  territory: 2.  Type:  C.  The  toponym  was  probably originally  * (Bile  ( 1988)  167\u00ad68),  later  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iv.8  (c. 230\u00ad210)).  The  city-ethnic  is   (I.Cret. iv  63  (C 6l/C5e)),  later  (I.Cret. ii.xvii.7 (C 2)). No  ancient  source  identifies L ebena  as  a  polis.  According to Strabo 10.4.11,  Lebena  was  the  emporion  of  Gortyn,  and we  should  perhaps  understand  Lebena  as  the  limen  held  by the  Gortynian  during  the  stasis  which  erupted  in Gortyn  at  the  time  of  the  Lyktian  War  (Polyb. 4.55.6 (r 221\u00ad219)).  However,  an  Archaic  inscription  seems  to  pre- serve  an  agreement,  perhaps  a  commercial  agreement, between     and    (I.Cret. iv  63 (C 6l/C5e)).  Not  only  is  the  collective  use  of  the  ethnic  good evidence  for  polis  status  on  Crete  (Perlman  ( 1996)  246\u00ad52), but  there  is  no  indication  from  what  survives  of  the  text  that was  politically  or  legally  inferior  to  . On  the  basis  of  this  text,  it  seems  possible  that Lebena  was  a  polis  (type  C)  in  the  political  sense  in  the  late Archaic  period. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  a  lex  sacra  (I.Cret. i.xvii.7  (C 2))  and  externally  in  the agreement  between  Gortyn  and  Lebena  (I.Cret. iv  63 (C 6l/C5e)).Lebena  is  the  only  Cretan  community  where  the individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  occurs  internally,  in  three cure  inscriptions  from  the  sanctuary  of  Asklepios  (I.Cret. i.xvii.8,9,15  (C 2\u00adC1)).For  the  individual  use  of  the  city-eth- nic  externally,  there  is  the  Hellenistic  graffito of  the  Cretan mercenary   ,  who  scratched  his  name on  a  noble's  tomb  in  the  Thebaid  (Syringes 816  (  Baillet ( 1920\u00ad26))). Lebena  is  best  known  for  her  Asklepieion,  the  excavated remains  of  which  are  principally  late  Hellenistic  and  Roman (Bultrighini  ( 1993)  81\u00ad99;  Kritzas  ( 1992\u00ad93)). Apart  from  the  theorodokos  appointed  by  Lebena c. 230\u00ad210  to  entertain  the  Delphic  theoroi  (BCH 45  ( 1921) iv.8;  Rigsby  ( 1986)  353  n. 13),  there  is  no  evidence  that  after c.C 5m  Lebena  had  her  own  officials or the authority t o  pass public  enactments.  When  and  under  what  circumstances this  came  about  and  the  nature  of  her  political  status  and relationship  with  Gortyn  thereafter  remain  uncertain.  The personal  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  a  good  indication  of  polis status  on  Crete  (Perlman  ( 1996)  250\u00ad52),and  Lebena  should perhaps  be  regarded  as  one  of  the  dependent  poleis  of Gortyn  during  the  late  Classical  and  Hellenistic  periods (ibid. 269\u00ad70). 973.

As  was  recognised  in  Antiquity,  the  name  means  \"rich  in lambs\"  (Steph.  Byz. 532.13\u00ad14). The  earliest  reference  to Polyrhen  as  a  polis  in  the  political sense  occurs  in  the  dedication  of to King  Areus  of  Sparta  (I.Cret. ii.xxiii.12A  (C 3f)).  Cf.  the agreement  of  Miletos        (Milet. i.3140.1,  67  (c. 259\u00ad250)).  For  polis  in  the  urban  sense, see  Ps.-Skylax  47,where  Polyrhen  is  listed  under  the  heading      .  Polyrhen  was  certainly  a  polis  in the  political  sense  by  the  early  Hellenistic  period.  That  it  was a  polis  in  the  late  Classical  period  too  is  indicated  by  the mint,  which  may  be  as  early  as  c. 330  (infra). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  occurs  internally  on the  coins  (infra)  and  in  the  dedication  in  honour  of  King Areus  of  Sparta  (I.Cret. ii.xxiii.12A  (C 3f)),  and  externally  in the  agreement  with  Miletos  (Milet. i.3140.67  (c. 259\u00ad250)). For  the  individual  use  there  is  the  proxenos  of  Oropos [ ][  ]    (IG vii  307 (C 3s)). Little  is  known  about  the  history  of  the  polis  prior  to the Hellenistic  period.  According  to  Strabo  10.4.13,  Polyrhen was  originally  settled  in  villages  ( \u00b5 '  ); Achaians  and  Lakonians  subsequently  fortified the acropo- lis  at  Polyrhen  and  synoecised  the  villages  (Gondiccas  ( 1988) 222\u00ad24).  Malkin,  who  does  not  dismiss  a  priori  the  tradition of  Spartan  involvement  in  the  foundation  of  Polyrhen, argues  for  a  period  of  Spartan  colonisation  in  C 8  (Malkin ( 1994)  73\u00ad83).Apart  from  traces  of  LH iii  pottery,  the  earliest material  at  Polyrhen  appears  to be  C 6l/C5e  (Blackman ( 1976c);  Gondiccas  ( 1988)  208). Ps.-Skylax  recorded  that  the  territory  of  Polyrhen  extend- ed  from  the  north  toward  the  south,       (Ps.-Skylax  47).  Gondiccas  defines the t erritory of  Polyrhen, (Markoulaki  ( 2000)  l. 20 (C 3e))  as  follows:  west  to  the  Mesogheia  mountains,  north to  the  coast  and  the  port  at  Kissamos  (itself  a  dependency  of Polyrhen,  Gondiccas  ( 1988)  169\u00ad70),  south  to  the  moun- tains  Kytroul\u00e8s  and  Kolymbos  (with  the  small  communities beyond  the  Typhlos  gorge--Kantanos,  Katre,  Pelkis-- friendly,  but  politically  insignificant and geographically 1182 perlman remote),  and  east  to  the  Rhodopou  peninsula  including Pergamon  (ibid. 277\u00ad85)  and  the  sanctuary  of  Diktynna  on Rhodopou  peninsula  (ibid. 224\u00ad31).  Polyrhen  shared  bor- ders  with  Kydonia  to  the  east  and  Phalasarna  to  the  west (Strabo  10.4.13)  and  fought  with  the  latter  in  C 4l  or  C 3e. Copies  of  the  treaty  of  peace  and  alliance  that  concluded these  hostilities  were  found  at  the  sanctuary  of  Diktynna (I.Cret. ii.xi.1  (C 3e))  and  at  a  sanctuary  at  ,  near Kaliviani  (Markoulaki  ( 2000));  the  latter  was  perhaps  locat- ed  on  the  frontier  between  Polyrhen  and  Phalasarna. The  polis  town  of  Polyrhen  was  built  on  the  summit  and slopes  of  a  steep  hill  in  the  mountain  range  of  Prophitis Elias,  with  the  lower  town  to  the  south-west  of  the  acropolis ( 418  m).  The  remains  of  the  polis  town cover  an  area  of roughly  30  ha,  including  the  cemetery  (C 4  and  later)  to  the north-west  (Niniou-Kindeli  ( 1992)).  Both  the  lower  town and  the  acropolis  were  fortified.  Ancient  walls  (C 4l/C3e)  are traceable  on  the  north  and  north-west  sides  of  the  acropolis and  on  the  north-west  (with  two  towers)  and  south-east (with  gate)  sides  of  the  lower  town  (Blackman  ( 1976c); Gondiccas  ( 1988)  175\u00ad77;  Markoulaki  ( 1988)).  Two  rock-cut aqueducts  supplied  water  to  the  city  (Blackman  ( 1976c)). Cisterns  on  the  acropolis  and  in  the  lower  city  may  be  no earlier  than  the  second  Byzantine  period  (ibid.).  Apart  from a  small  extra-mural  temple  (C 3)  located  at  sto  Yero Kolymbo  in  the  gorge  to the  east  of  the  polis  town (Gondiccas  ( 1988)  183\u00ad85)  and  the  cemetery,  all  remaining traces  of  the  community  are  intramural  (ibid. 173\u00ad83).Walls of  the  early  Hellenistic  period  attributed  to  a  monumental temple  with  an  altar  or  stoa  along  its  north  side  were  exca- vated  within  the  fortification walls in the c entre  of  the  lower town,  just  north  of  the  Church of  the  Ninety-nine  Fathers (Theophanides  ( 1942\u00ad44a);  Gondiccas  ( 1988)  178\u00ad82). Traces  of  walls  and  rock  cuttings  on  the  south  and  south- east  slopes  of  the  hill  and  in  the  village  indicate  the  location of  residential  areas  (Gondiccas  ( 1988)  182\u00ad83;  Markoulaki ( 1996)). Polyrhen  minted  coins  (staters)  on  the  Aiginetan  stan- dard  during  the  period  c. 330\u00ad280/270.  Types:  obv.  head  of Zeus; rev. filleted frontal bull's head; legend: (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pl.  XXV. 21\u00ad25,  28\u00ad30, with  Le Rider  ( 1966)  190,  198;  IGCH  no. 109;  SNG  Cop.

Another  extra-Cretan  inscription  preserves  the  city-ethnic (Pagasai,  Thess.  Mnem.no. 83  (C 3l/C2f)). The  earliest  reference  to  Priansos  as  a  polis  (in  the  politi- cal  sense)  occurs  in  the  agreement  of  Miletos         (Milet. i.3140.1,  37  (c. 259\u00ad250)).  The observation  that  Priansos  may  have  been  minting  coins  as early  as  c. 330  (infra)  suggests  that  the  community  was  a  polis in  the  political  sense  already  in  the  late  Classical  period. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  the  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  Hellenistic  treaties (I.Cret. iii.iii.4  (C 3l/C2e);  I.Cret. iv  174  (C 3l/C2e)).

The  Hellenistic  borders  of  Priansos  are described  in  the  alliance  of  Priansos  with  Hierapytna  and Gortyn  (I.Cret. iv  174,ll.  16\u00ad30  (C 3l/C2e)).  The  description of  the  border  with  Gortyn  begins  at  the  south  coast,  so  it seems  likely  that  the  Geometric\u00adRoman  cave  sanctuary  of    at  Tsoutsouros  (ancient  Einatos)  was located  within  her  territory  (I.Cret. iv  174.60\u00ad61,  76;  Faure ( 1996)  75\u00ad77).  Einatos  (in  Linear  B  wi-na-to,  McArthur ( 1993)  152)  may  have  served  as  a  port  for  Priansos.  Coin  types (infra)  suggest  that  Priansos  was  oriented  to  the  sea.  The mouth  of  the  river  Mintris  would  seem  the  likely  place  to look  for  an  ancient  harbour,  but  no  ancient  harbour  facil- 1184 perlman ities  are  visible  today.  This  may  be  due  to  several  geological factors,  including  coastal  uplift  and  riverine  silting  (person- al  observation). Nothing  is  known  about  the  urban  centre  of  Priansos, which  was  probably  located  in  the  vicinity  of  Kastelliana.  A Hellenistic  inscription  refers  to  an  andreion  at  Priansos (I.Cret. iii.iii.4.38\u00ad40  (C 3l/C2e)).  In  so  far  as  andreia  are attested  elsewhere  on  Crete  during  the  Archaic  and  Classical periods  (see  Axos,  Datala  and  Eltynia,  supra),  it  is  possible that  also  at  Priansos  it  was  pre-Hellenistic.  Athena  Polias,  in whose  sanctuary  public  enactments  were  displayed,  was probably  the  protecting  deity  of  the  polis  (I.Cret. iii.iii.4.79\u00ad80  (C 3l/C2e)). Priansos  struck  coins  (staters,  drachms,  hemidrachms) on  the  Aiginetan  standard  during  the  period  c. 330\u00ad280/270 (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  190,  198;  IGCH  no. 109).  Staters  have  obv. seated  goddess  with  serpent  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  295: Hygieia?);  rev.  Poseidon  standing  holding  his  trident,  or goat  protome  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pl.  XXVIII. 21\u00ad23;  SNG  Cop. Aeg.Isl. 544\u00ad45).  Drachms  and  hemidrachms  have  obv.  head of  a  goddess  (Guarducci  ( 1935)  280:  Artemis?);  rev.  trident (drachms  only),  or  palm  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pl.  XXVI- II. 24\u00ad28;  SNG Cop.

For  a  connection  with  Homeric     see Guarducci  ( 1939)  110;  Bile  ( 1988)  181. Ps.-Skylax 47  provides  the  earliest  reference  to Lisos  as  a polis,  in  this  case  in  the  urban  sense.  The  earliest  secure  ref- erences  to Lisos  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  occur  in enactment  formulas  of  the  Hellenistic  period  (SEG 45  1314). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  occurs  internally  on the  C 4s\u00adC3f  coins  (infra)  and  in  the  enactment  formulas  of  Hellenistic  inscriptions  (SEG 45  1314).  For  a  possible example  of  the  collective  use  externally  ([ ()?]),  see I.Cret. iv  179.8  (c. 183).  For  a  possible  example  of  the  individ- ual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  there  is  the  proxenos?  of Gortyn  [ ] \u00b5 [  ?] (I.Cret.iv  387 (C 2)). Lisos  formed  an  alliance  with  Hyrtakina  (coins,  infra)  and was  a  member  of  the  C 4l\u00adC3  federation (van Effenterre  ( 1948a)  119\u00ad27;  Chaniotis  ( 1996)  106\u00ad8,421\u00ad22;  cf. Sekunda  ( 2000)337\u00ad38:leaguefoundedC3f).Lisosmayhave been  at  one  time  the  federation's  capital  (Guarducci  ( 1939) 211)  or  its  religious  centre  (Bultrighini  ( 1993)  107\u00ad13). The  remains  of  the  polis  town  of  Lisos  occupy  the  floor and  slopes  of  a  small  valley  on  Ag.  Kyrkos  Bay.  The  earliest remains  appear  to  date  to  C 5l  or  C 4f.  Rock  cuttings  on  the slopes  to  the  east  of  the  valley  floor indicate the presence there  of  a  residential  quarter  (personal  observation). Terraces  on  these  same  slopes  may  be  ancient.  The  Roman cemetery  with  its  barrel-vaulted  tombs  was  located  on  the western  slopes  above  the  valley  floor (Sanders ( 1982)  42). The  location  of  the  earlier  cemetery  is  unknown.  The  valley floor was most likely the location of  the  harbour.  Tectonic uplift,  probably  in  ad  438  (Thommeret  et al.( 1981)),  raised this  part  of  the  Cretan  coast.  A  sea  wall  protected  the  shore from  marine  erosion  (observation  of  E.  Hadjidaki).  The protecting  deity  of  Lisos  was  probably  Diktynna  (coins, C 4s\u00adC3f,  infra;  I.Cret. ii.xvii.1  (C 3f)).  Her  sanctuary  is attested  epigraphically,  but  has  not  been  located  (I.Cret. ii.xvii.1  (C 3f)).  A  sanctuary  in  honour  of  Asklepios  and Hygieia  (peribolos  wall,  Doric  limestone  temple  and  auxil- iary  buildings)  was  located  near  a  spring  below  the  cliffs  to the  north  of  the  valley  floor.  The  sanctuary  was  excavated during  the  period  1957\u00ad60  and  appears  to  date  primarily  to the  Hellenistic  and  Roman  periods.  For  a  brief  overview with  references  to  the  interim  excavation  reports,  see  Platon ( 1992);  for  the  cult,  see  Bultrighini  ( 1993)  102\u00ad13.A  small  the- atre (internal  diameter  of  the  cavea  approximately  15  m)  was located  in  the  valley  to  the  south-west  of  the  sanctuary  of Asklepios  and  Hygieia  (Sanders  ( 1982)  171\u00ad72  ( 19/18)). The  visible  remains  are  Roman.  Traces  of  an  ancient  road (communicating  with  Hyrtakina?)  are  visible  on  the  west- ern  slopes  above  the  valley  floor (Niniou-Kindeli ( 1990)). Lisos  and  Hyrtakina  produced  an  alliance  coinage  of small  denominations  in  silver  and  gold  (C 4s\u00adC3f;  cf. Sekunda  ( 2000)  337:  c.C 3m).  Types:  obv./rev.  dove  (or eagle?),  or  dolphin,  or  star.  Legend  (obv.,  rev.): -,  - ,or -  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pl.  XVIII. 12\u00ad20; SNG  Cop.  Aeg.Isl. 469).  Lisos  struck  her  own  coinage (bronze)  in  C 3s  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pl.  XVIII. 12\u00ad20). 974.Lyktos  (Lyktios) Map  60.  Lat. 35.15,long.  25.20.  Size of  territory: 4.  Type:  [A].  The  toponym  is  (Hom.  Il. 2.647,  17.611;  Hes.  Th. 477).  The  city-ethnic  is   (I.Cret. i.xviii.4  (C 6);  SEG 35  991  (C 6l)).  The  earliest  coins have  (C 5s,  infra).  Later  issues  have  at  first and  later  the  assimilated  form   (infra).  Assimilated  forms  of  both  the  toponym  and the  city-ethnic  begin  to  appear  in  the  inscriptions from  Crete  in  C 3m  (e.g.  I.Cret. iii.vi.11\u00ad12;  I.Cret. i.xviii.8) and  outside  Crete  already  in  C 5s  (I.Lindos 13;  cf.  Bile  ( 1988) 156  n. 345);  but  the  unassimilated  forms  continue  in  use  (e.g. Arist.  Pol. 1271b28). Polybios  claimed  that  Lyktos  was  the  oldest  of  the  Cretan poleis  (Polyb. 4.54.6),  but  the  earliest  unquestionable  attes- tations  of  Lyktos  as  a  polis  occur  in  the  enactment  formula  of the  alliance  of  Lyktos  with  Antiochos  II  (I.Cret. i.xviii.8.5 (C 3m))  and  in  the  agreement  of  Miletos           including  Lyktos  (Milet. i.3140.1  (c. 259\u00ad 250)).  The  use  in  both  is  political.  For  polis  in  the  urban sense,  see  Ps.-Skylax  47,  where  Lyktos  is  listed  under  the heading      .  Diodoros  calls  Lyktos  a polis  in  the  urban  sense  in  his  account  of  the  destruction  of Lyktos  in  C 4m  (Diod. 16.62.3).  There  is  no  question  that Lyktos  was  an  Archaic  and  Classical  polis,  but  without  an early  attestation  of  the  term  in  reference  to  the  community, Lyktos  is  included  in  the  Inventory  as  a  probable  polis (type  B). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  occurs  internally  in three  Archaic  laws,  once  in  an  uncertain  context  in  the  sin- gular  (I.Cret. i.xviii.4.5\u00ad6  (C 6l))  and  twice  in  enactment  for- mulas  (SEG 35.991A.1  and  B. 1  (C 6l/C5e)).  It  occurs externally  in  the  treaty  between  Lyktos  and  Lindos  (I.Lindos 13.1\u00ad2  (C 5s)).  For  the  individual  use  there  are,  e.g.,  the  prox- enos  of  Gortyn, \u00b5    (I.Cret. iv 206  (C 3/C2))  and  the  mercenary     who  died  at  Pagasai  (IG ix\u00b2  365  (C 3)). In  Greek  epic,  Lyktos  was  the  home  of  Koiranos,  the  char- ioteer  of  Meriones  (Hom.  Il. 17.611).  Later  tradition,  first crete  1175 attested  in  Ephorus  and  Aristotle,  maintained  that  the Spartans  had  colonised  Lyktos  (Ephor.  frr. 147\u00ad49;Arist.Pol. 1271b28\u00ad30;  Malkin  ( 1994)  73\u00ad83).Plutarch preserved  a  story which  synchronised  the  colonisation  of  Lyktos  with  that  of Melos  in  C 8,  and  identified the Spartan oecist of  Lyktos  as Pollis  (Plut.  Mor. 247E).  Archers  from  Lyktos  fought  with the  Spartans  in  the  Second  Messenian  War  (Paus. 4.19.4 (rC 7)).According  to  Spartan  tradition,  Lykourgos  modelled his  reforms  on  the  laws  of  Minos,  which  were  still  used  by the  descendants  of  the  pre-Spartan  inhabitants  of  the  region (Arist.  Pol. 1271b28\u00ad30;  cf.  Ephor.  frr. 147\u00ad49;  Perlman ( 1992)).  Several  Archaic  public  inscriptions  of  Lyktos  (all laws?)  survive  (I.Cret. i.xviii.1\u00ad6;  SEG 35  991A,  B (C 6m\u00adC5e)).  According  to  Strabo,  Lyktos  and  Gortyn  for  a time  superseded  Knosos  as  the  foremost  cities  of  Crete (Strabo  10.4.7).  Both  the  late  Archaic  period  (Viviers  ( 1994) 252\u00ad59;  Coldstream  and  Huxley  ( 1999)  301\u00ad4)  and  C 4e (Erickson  ( 2000)  331\u00ad65)  have  been  proposed  as  periods  of Lyktian  expansion.

The  toponym  is  not  attested  epi- graphically  and  not  at  all  in  Doric.  In  literary  sources  it  is (Hom.Il.2.647;Ephor.fr.127).The city-ethnic was (BCH 70  ( 1946)  588\u00ad90  no. 1  (C 6e);  I.Cret. i.ix.1.144\u00ad52  (C 6l);  cf.  Chaniotis  ( 1996)  200:  c. 220). The  earliest  reference  to  Milatos  as  a  polis  in  the  political sense  occurs  in  the  first line of  the  agreement  of  Ionian Miletos         (Milet.i.3140.1,36 (c. 259\u00ad250)).  Strabo  10.4.14  described  Milatos  as  a  polis found  in  Homer  (Il. 2.647)  which  no  longer  existed  because Lyktos  destroyed  the  polis  (   ) and  occupied  its  chora  (     \u00b5) (Strabo 10.4.14).  Here  the  use  is  probably  urban. Milatos  is  included  in  the  Inventory  as  a  possible  polis (type  C)  principally  on  the  strength  of  a  (possibly)  Archaic text  embedded  in  the  Hellenistic  Drerian  \"oath  of  the  180 panazostoi  agelaoi\"  that  describes     as  having waged  war  against  Dreros  (I.Cret. i.ix.1.137\u00ad64 (C 6l)  Nomima i48;  cf.  Chaniotis  ( 1996)  200).For  an  earli- er  attestation  of  the  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic,  also external,  see  BCH 70  ( 1946)  588\u00ad90  no. 1  (C 6e)).  Both  the context  (border  war)  and  the  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic suggest  that  Milatos  was  a  polis  (but  cf.  Perlman  ( 1996) 252\u00ad58). The  polis  town  of  Milatos  was  located  on  the  peak  and  the steeply  terraced  west  slopes  of  Kastellos,  directly  on  the north  coast  1.5  km  north-east  of  the  modern  village  of Milatos  (Nowicki  ( 2000)  170\u00ad71).According  to  a  legend  first attested  in  Ephor.  fr. 127,  colonists  from  Milatos  founded Miletos  in  Asia  Minor.  During  the  Archaic  period  Milatos most  likely  shared  a  border  with  Dreros,  with  whom  she perhaps  contended  for  the  possession  of  some  territory (I.Cret. i.ix.1.137\u00ad64  Nomima i48  (C 6l);  cf.  Chaniotis ( 1996)  200  (c. 220)). 978. ", "Sybrita": "Identifier: 991. , (Sybritios) Map  60.  Lat. 35.15,long.  24.40. Size of  territory: 2.Type:  [A].  The  toponym  is  (Ps.- Skylax 47)  and  is  probably  attested  in  Linear  A  and  B  as  su- ki-ri-ta  (Scafa  ( 1994)).  The  toponym  means  \"town  of  the wild  boar\"  (ibid.).

In  Ps.-Skylax 47,  where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense, Sybrita  is  one  of  the  toponyms  listed  under  the  heading      .The  asylia  decree  of  Sybrita  for Teos  provides  the  earliest  reference  to Sybrita  as  a  polis  in  the political  sense  (I.Cret. ii.xxvi.1  (C 3l)). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  occurs  internally  on the  coins  (C 4s,  infra)  and  externally  in  a  treaty  with  Gortyn (I.Cret. iv  183  (C 3l/C2e))  and  in  the  asylia  decree  for  Teos  (I.Cret. ii.xxvi.1  (C 3l)).  For  the  individual  use  there  is  [---]     , proxenos  of  Aptara (I.Cret. ii.iii.5B  (C 2f)). Very  little  is  known  about  the  history  of  Sybrita.  During the  Hellenistic  period  Sybrita  and  Gortyn  arranged  an alliance  (I.Cret. iv  183;  Chaniotis  ( 1996)  267\u00ad70  (C 3l/C2e)). Shared  coin  types  have  been  understood  to  indicate  that these  two  poleis  may  have  earlier  (C 4s)  joined  together  in  a sympoliteia  (infra). The  acropolis  of  the  polis  town  of  Sybrita,  Kephala ( 500\u00ad618  m),  appears  to  have  been  continuously  inhabited from  LM iiiC  (Prokopiou  ( 1991);  D'Agata  ( 1999);  Rocchetti and  D'Agata  ( 1999)).  Its  commanding  position  dominated the  Amari  valley,  a  principal  line  of  communication between  the  Mesara  and  the  north  coast  of  the  island.  The construction  in  C 9s  of  a  monumental  building  (Edificio A 1, c. 7  m 7  m)  on  the  southern  plateau  of  Kephala  has  been understood  to  reflect a new political organisation of  the community,  and  perhaps  the  emergence  of  the  polis (Rocchetti  and  D'Agata  ( 1999);  D'Agata  ( 2000)).  At  its greatest  extent  (in  the  Hellenistic  period)  the  polis  town of Sybrita  extended  from  the  acropolis  south-west  to  the  vil- lages  of  Yenna  and  Ag.  Photini  and  north-east  towards  the village  of  Klisidhi.  Stretches  of  defence  walls  of  the  Archaic, Hellenistic  and  later  periods  have  been  identified on the summit  and  slopes  of  the  acropolis  (Kirsten  ( 1951); Belgiorno  ( 1994)),  with  gates  located  on  its  north-eastern slope  (Belgiorno  ( 1994)  217.13)  and  on  the  south-western slope  at  Lagou  Kharakou  (ibid. 218.17).  A  temple (Hellenistic?),  perhaps  of  Dionysos,  may  be  located  beneath the  small  chapel  Ekklesia  tou  Christou  on  the  south-western slope  of  the  acropolis  (ibid. 215.8).  The  principal  residential districts  appear  to  have  been  situated  on  the  southern  and south-western  slopes  of  the  acropolis.  Three  cemeteries have  been  located:  two  to  the  south-west  of  Kephala  near Yenna  and  a  third  to  the  north  of  Kephala  at  ta  Ellenika.  A sanctuary  of  Hermes  Kranaios  (LM i\u00adRoman,  with  gaps) located  at  Patsos  c. 5  km  to the  south-west  of  Kephala  proba- bly  lay  within  the  territory  of  Sybrita  (Kourou  and  Karetsou ( 1994)).  The  Amari  valley  is  very  well  watered,  and  there  are crete  1187 many  springs,  cisterns,  fountains  and  artesian  wells  in  the vicinity  of  ancient  Sybrita  (Belgiorno  ( 1994)  224\u00ad25).  For  a survey  of  material  remains  in  the  vicinity  of  Sybrita,  see Belgiorno  ( 1994);  for  the  Greek\u00adItalian  excavations  at Thronos  Kephala  ( 1987\u00ad99),  see  Rocchetti  ( 1994a);  D'Agata ( 1999);  Rocchetti  and  D'Agata  ( 1999);  D'Agata  (forthcom- ing,  non  vidi). Sybrita  struck  coins  (all  denominations)  on  the  Aiginetan standard  intermittently  during  the  period  c. 380\u00ad280/270 (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  196;Kraay ( 1976)  53).  The  earliest  coins (staters,  c. 380)  have  obv.  Hermes  seated;  rev.  hippocamp within  an  incuse  square;  legend: written ret- rograde  in  the  epichoric  alphabet  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  pl. XXXIV. 19  with  p. 196).  For  a  short  time  (c. 360/350\u00ad340/330) Sybrita  minted  coins  (staters,  drachms,  hemidrachms)  with Gortynian  types,  perhaps  reflecting a sympoliteia  or  alliance between  the  two  poleis  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  160\u00ad62).  Staters have:  obv.  Europa  seated  in  a  tree;  legend: writ- ten  retrograde  in  the  epichoric  alphabet  on  some;  rev.  bull; legend: written  retrograde  in  the  epichoric  alpha- bet  on  some.

The  earliest  references  to  Dreros  as  a  polis  in  the  political sense  occur  in  the  enactment  formulas  of  two  Archaic  laws (  ,  SEG 27  620  ML 2.1  (C 7m),  Nomima i81 (C 7m);    ,  BCH 70  ( 1946)  590\u00ad97  no. 2 (C 7l)  Nomima i64).  For  a  possible  Archaic  use  there  is  the \"public  record of  the  ancient  Drerian  land\"  ( \u00b5\u00b5       ),  which  refers  to  the  enmity of  the  Milatioi  towards         (I.Cret. i.ix.1,ll.  147\u00ad48;  for  the  date  of  the  \u00b5\u00b5,see Nomima i 48  (C 6l);  cf.  Chaniotis  ( 1996)  200  (c. 220)).  The  term  is  per- haps  used  in  the  sense  of  polis  town  in  the  phrase        ,\"the  20  of  the  city\"  (Nomima i81  (C 7m)). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  occurs  internally  in the \u00b5\u00b5  quoted  above  (I.Cret. i.ix.i,  ll. 147\u00ad48  (C 6l  or c. 220)),  and  externally  in  the  agreement  between  Knosos and  Miletos  which  Dreros  co-signed  (Milet. i.3140.38 (c. 259\u00ad250)).  For  the  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  there is  the  immigrant  from  Dreros  to  Miletos, [ ]  []   (Milet. i.338p4  (C 3s)). One  of  the  \u00b5\u00b5  of  Dreros  refers  to the  territory, ,  contested  by  Dreros  and  Milatos,  her  neighbour  to the  west  (I.Cret. i.ix.i,  ll. 149\u00ad52). The  term  occurs  in  the  enactment  formula  of  an Archaic  law,      (BCH  70  ( 1946) 590\u00ad97  no. 2  (C 7l)  Nomima i64):  \"the  polis  decided  after consultation  with  the  phylai\"  or  \"the  polis  decided  after  dis- missing  the  phylai\"  (for  the  derivation  of  the  term (pl.  part.?)  from  * /  ,see van Effenterre ( 1946)  592).The  names  of  two  phylai  are  preserved  in  the  dat- ing  formulas  of  public  enactments: \u00b5(BCH60(1936) 280\u00ad85  (C 4/C3)); (BCH 61  ( 1937)  29\u00ad32  (C 4/C3); I.Cret. i.ix.1,ll.  3\u00ad9  (c. 220)).  The  eponymous  \u00b5  were organised  by  phylai.  One  of  the  \u00b5\u00b5  of  Dreros mentions  the  citizen  (I.Cret. i.ix.1,l.  154  (C 6l  or c. 220)),  while  the  Hellenistic  civic  oath  mentions  the (I.Cret. i.ix.1,ll.  124,  135  (c. 220)).  Both  may  be attested  as  well  in  an  Archaic  law  (SEG 23  530  (C 7l);  but  cf. Nomima ii  89).  An  adult  male  citizen  population  of  c. 7,000 for  C 3  Dreros  has  been  suggested  on  the  basis  of  the  180    who  swore  the  civic  oath  (I.Cret. i.ix.1,ll.  10\u00ad14  (C 3l);  Marinatos  ( 1936);  cf.  Chaniotis  ( 1996) 199:  the 180  is  a  representative  group  only,  and  so  is  of  little use  in  estimating  the  size  of  the  population). The  public  enactments  of  Dreros  were  ratified b y  the (SEG 27  620  (C 7m);  BCH 70  ( 1946)  590\u00ad97  no. 2 (C 7l)).  Whether  in  this  context  refers  to  the  political crete  1157 community  or  to  the  assembly  cannot  be  determined.  The term \u00b5  is  used  for  the  assembly  in  the  enactment  for- mula  of  a  Hellenistic  proxeny  decree  (BCH 60  ( 1936)  280\u00ad85 (C 4/C3)).The  \u00b5  appear  to  have  been  the  chief  officials of  the  Archaic  polis  and  to  have  exercised  both  executive  and judicial  authority  (SEG 27  620  (C 7m)).The  board  of \u00b5 consisted  of  five members plus the  \u00b5\u00b5  in  a  public enactment  of  c. 220  (I.Cret. i.ix.1).  Whatever  the  precise motive  for  the  enactment  of  SEG 27  620  (fear  of  tyranny, demands  on  the  part  of  the  \u00e9lite  for  equal  representation, experience  of  judicial  misconduct),  the  interest  of  the  polis in  controlling  the  authority  of  the  \u00b5  is  demonstrated by  the  harsh  penalties,  including  atimia  for  life,  which  the polis  imposed  upon  \u00b5  who  disregarded  the  law.  For other  laws  of  C 7,see SEG 23  530;  BCH 70  ( 1946)  590\u00ad97  no. 2, 600\u00ad2  no. 4.  During  the  Hellenistic  period,  and  no  doubt earlier  as  well,  one  member  of  the  board  of \u00b5  served  as the  eponymous  magistrate  for  the  polis  (BCH 60  ( 1936) 280\u00ad85).  In  addition  to  the  \u00b5,  the  Archaic  laws  of Dreros  preserve  four  terms  which  may  denote  public  offi- cials:  (i)  \u00b5  (SEG 27  620  (C 7m)),  comptrollers (Ehrenberg  ( 1943)  14),or  citizen  landowners  (van  Effenterre ( 1985)  394\u00ad96);  (ii)        ,  the  twenty  of the  city  (SEG 27  620  (C 7m)),a  council  perhaps  of  the  men  of the  city  who  were  eligible  to  serve  as  \u00b5  (Nomima i81: \"dirigeants  politiques  de  l'acropole\");  (iii)     [ ], \"les  redresseurs\"  (Nomima i27  (c. 575);  cf.  Bile  ( 1988)  359  n. 124:    (priests));  and  (iv)  ,  assem- bler  (BCH 70  ( 1946)  590\u00ad97  no. 2),  either  a  political  official who  convened  the  assembly  or  a  military  officer who called out  the  troops  (van  Effenterre  ( 1946)  590\u00ad97).  The  council ( )  is  not  attested  before  the  Hellenistic  period  (BCH 60  ( 1936)  280\u00ad85  (C 4/C3)). The  polis  town  of  Dreros  occupied  a  double  acropolis  and the  connecting  saddle.  There  were  two  circuit  walls  built  in part  of  polygonal  masonry;  one  protected  the  entire  polis town  (two  peaks  and  the  saddle),  an  area  of  c. 28  ha,  and  a second  the  acropolis  proper,  viz.  Ag.  Antonios,  the  eastern summit  (Marinatos  ( 1936)  217\u00ad19;  Demargne  and  van Effenterre ( 1937)  7).  An  altar  and  four  cisterns  were  located on  the  summit  of  the  Ag.  Antonios  (Marinatos  ( 1936)  216; Demargne  and  van  Effenterre  ( 1937)  7).A  large  public  build- ing  ( 24  m 10  m),  probably  a  temple,  was  excavated  on  the western  summit  (Xanthoudides  ( 1918)  23\u00ad28;  cf.  Marinatos ( 1936)  254:  the  building  is  an  andreion).  Residential  areas occupied  the  northern  (and  southern?)  slopes  of  both acropolises  (Xanthoudides  ( 1918)  28\u00ad29;  Marinatos  ( 1936) 216\u00ad17).  The  public  centre  (agora  with  plateia  and  theatral steps,  cistern,  temple  of  Apollo  Delphinios,  and  possibly prytaneion)  was  located  in  the  saddle  (for  the  temple,  see Marinatos  ( 1936)  219\u00ad83;  cf.  Mazarakis  Ainian  ( 1997)  217\u00ad18: the  temple  was  not  free-standing  but  part  of  a  building  com- plex;  for  the  agora,  see  Demargne  and  van  Effenterre  ( 1937) 10\u00ad32).  The  Archaic  laws  of  Dreros  were  probably  inscribed on  the  east  wall  of  the  temple,  and  would  have  been  visible from  the  plateia  and  theatral  steps  below  and  to  the  east  of the  temple  terrace.  It  has  been  suggested  that  these  steps were  used  for  meetings  of  a  political  institution  (Hansen and  Fischer-Hansen  ( 1994)  62).  The  terracing  and  construc- tion  of  the  theatral  steps  of  the  agora  and  the  construction  of the  temple  appear  to  be  contemporary  (C 8f:  Demargne  and van  Effenterre  ( 1937);  cf.  van  Effenterre  ( 1992a):  the  plataia and  theatral  steps  were  laid  out  in  C 6).  The  cistern  was  built c. 220  (Demargne  and  van  Effenterre  ( 1937)  27\u00ad32;  Chaniotis ( 1996)  195\u00ad201)  and  the  \"prytaneion\"  during  C 4s/C3f (Demargne  and  van  Effenterre  ( 1937)  15\u00ad18).  A  sub- Mycenaean  Geometric  cemetery  was  located  to  the  north- east  of  the  acropolis  (van  Effenterre  ( 1948a)  esp. 15\u00ad22). Apollo  Delphinios  was  probably  the  protecting  deity  of the  polis. 957. ", "Rhithymnos": "Identifier: 989. , (Rhithymnios)  Map  60.  Lat. 35.20,long. 24.30.  Size  of  territory: 3.  Type:  C.  The  toponym  is  not  attest- ed  in  the  inscriptions  from  Crete.  Inscriptions  from  else- where  and  literary  sources  spell  the  toponym  `\u00b5 (Arkesine,  IG xii.77A.3  (C 4l\u00adC3e)), `\u00b5  (Delphi,  BCH 45  ( 1921)  iii.116  (c. 230\u00ad210)),  and  `\u00b5  (Steph.  Byz. 545.7).  Rhithymnos  may  have  been  renamed  Arsino\u00eb  during the  period  C 3l\u00adC2e  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  242\u00ad45:  reign of  Ptolemy IV).  The  city-ethnic  is  `\u00b5  (I.Cret. i.xxii.4A  (C 3f)). Steph.  Byz. 545.7  is  the  only  source  to  identify Rhithymnos  as  a  polis.  Aelian  called  Rhithymnos  a  \u00b5 (Ael.  NA 14.20).  That  Rhithymnos  was  a  polis  in  the  political sense  during  the  late  Classical  and  early  Hellenistic  periods is  suggested  by  her  mint,  which  may  have  begun  as  early  as c. 330  (infra),  by a  proxeny  decree  of  C 4l\u00adC3e  in  which  a  cit- izen  of  Rhithymnos  is  granted  proxenia  by  Arkesine  (IG xii.77A  (C 4l\u00adC3e)),  and  by  the  personal  use  of  the  city- ethnic  (Perlman  ( 1996)  246\u00ad52;  infra). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  not  attested,  but  is undoubtedly  to  be  recognised  in  the  legend  which appears  on  the  reverse  of  the  coins  (infra).  For  the  individual and  external  use  there  is  the  funerary  columella  of  \u00b5 `\u00b5  (IG ii\u00b2  10135  (C 4/C3))  and  the  crete  1185 proxenoi of Olous, [ ]\u00b5 `\u00b5  (I.Cret. i.xxii.4A  (C 3f)),and  of  Gortyn,  [---,  son of  ---]  `\u00b5  (I.Cret. iv  207  (C 3)). The  evidence  for  the  history  and  institutions  of Rhithymnos  dates  to  the  Hellenistic  period.  The  remains  of ancient  Rhithymnos  lie  concealed  beneath  those  of  the Venetian  city.  For  a  brief  survey  of  ancient  remains  in  the modern  city,  see  Stratidakis  ( 1995)  326\u00ad27.The  acropolis  was more  than  likely  located  on  the  high  promontory  where  the Venetians  later  built  their  fort  (Fortetsa).  The  town  and  har- bour  were probably  to the  east  of  the  promontory;  rock-cut slipways  and  a  fish tank have been identified  to  the  west  of Fortetsa  (Blackman  ( 1976d)).  Onorio  Belli  describes  the remains  of  a  square  temple  with  a  portico  upon  a  hill  in  the vicinity  of  Rhithymnos,  but  the  location  of  this  building  is unknown  (Falkener  ( 1854)  25). Rhithymnos  struck  coins  (staters,  drachms,  hemi- drachms)  on  the  Aiginetan  standard  during  the  period c. 330\u00ad280/270  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  190,  198).  Her  output  was small.  Staters  have  obv.  head  of  Apollo;  rev.Apollo lithophoros  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pl.  XXX. 1).  Drachms  and hemidrachms  have  obv.  head  of  Athena;  rev.  trident-head and  dolphins  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pls.  XXXIX. 33,  XXX. 3;  SNG Cop.  Aeg.Isl. 555).

The  adverbial  ', which  occurs  in  the  agreement  between  the  Rhittenioi  and Gortyn  (I.Cret. iv  80  (C 5e)),  indicates  that  the  toponym  was either '  or '  (Bile  ( 1988)  145,  168).  The  form `  occurs  in  Stephanos  (Steph.  Byz. 544.20)  and  has been  restored  in  two  inscriptions:  (i)  a  fragment  of  an Archaic  epichoric  inscription  from  Patela  Prinias  (I.Cret. i.xxviii.2  (C 6))  and  (ii)  an  agreement  between  Gortyn  and Knosos  (I.Cret. iv  182  (C 2)).  In  both  cases,  the  restorations of  the  toponym  are  problematic  (Faure  ( 1993)  70).  The  city- ethnic  was  '  (I.Cret. iv  80  (C 5e)). Only  Stephanos  refers  to  *Rhitten  (Rhizenia)  as  a  polis (Steph.  Byz. 544.21).  The  agreement  of  Gortyn  for  *Rhitten recognised  that  the  Rhittenioi  were  \u00b5  and (I.Cret.iv80(C5e)).From this same text we learn further  that  the  Rhittenioi  enjoyed  their  own  assembly  (    ',     \u00b5),  council ( ;  for  the  meaning  of  the  term,  see  Davaras ( 1980);  Bile  ( 1988)  341),  and  public  officials ( \u00b5, ).  On  the  other  hand,  certain  delicts  fell  under  the joint  jurisdiction  of  Gortyn  and  *Rhitten  ( 4\u00ad12),and  certain complaints  against  Gortyn  and  individual  Gortynioi  were heard  in  Gortyn  ( 12\u00ad15).  Furthermore,  Gortyn  owned  at least  some  territory  which  was  occupied  by  Rhittenioi,  and  it was  within  the  jurisdiction  of  Gortyn  to  determine  the rights  of  those  occupants  to  its  use  ( 3\u00ad4).On  balance  the  evi- dence  suggests  that  *Rhitten  was  a  polis  with  her  own  laws, courts,  magistrates,  council  and  assembly,  but  a  dependent polis  of  Gortyn  (which  controlled  land  within  the  territory of  *Rhitten  and  could  under  certain  circumstances  abrogate the  judicial  and  executive  authority  of  the  state  (Perlman ( 1996)  265\u00ad66)). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  occurs  externally  in the  agreement  of  Gortyn  and  *Rhitten  (I.Cret. iv  80  (C 5e)). The  location  of  ancient  *Rhitten  has  been  the  subject  of controversy.  Guarducci  identified ancient *Rhitten w ith  the remains  of  the  important  settlement  at  Patela  Prinias  c. 11  km north  of  Gortyn,  and  the  majority  of  scholars  have  followed her  lead  (Guarducci  ( 1935)  294;  van  Effenterre  ( 1993);  cf. Nomima i7).  Faure  has  long  championed  an  alternative location  for  ancient  *Rhitten  south  of  the  Mesara  in  the Asterousia  mountains  near  Apesokari  at  the  foot  of  a  chain of  hills  called     (Faure  ( 1963)  22\u00ad24,(1993)  70). Faure's  arguments  against  the  opinio  communis  are  convinc- ing.  His  arguments  in  favour  of    are  some- what  less  compelling  (Perlman  ( 1996)  262\u00ad63).  The  ancient site  near  Apesokari  has  not  been  explored,  and  all  that  may be  said  about  it  is  that  the  surface  remains  date  to  the Classical  and  Hellenistic  periods  (Faure  ( 1963)  24).  The  set- tlement  on  Patela  Prinias,  a  high  triangular-shaped  plateau, c. 11.5  ha  in  area,  located  at  the  junction  of  two  valleys  which connect  the  northern  and  southern  coasts,  was  established in  C 13  and  continued  until  C 6m.  Defensive  walls  have  been identified below P atela  Prinias  restricting  access  through  the valleys  and  up  to  the  plateau.  Residential  districts  that  attest a  degree  of  town-planning  have  been  excavated  at  the northern  edge  of  the  plateau  and  to  the  south-east  in  the vicinity  of  the  two  large  buildings,  Temple  A  (C 7)  and \"Temple  B\"  (Subminoan/Protogeometric\u00adC 7l).  Mazarakis Ainian  suggests  that  \"Temple  B\"  was  not,  in  fact,  a  temple but  a  public  building  with  some  other  function,  perhaps  e.g. a  prytaneion,  during  its  final (C 7)  phase  (Mazarakis  Ainian ( 1997)  224\u00ad26).  The  cemetery  (also  C 13\u00adC6m)  was  500  m north-west  of  Patela  at  Siderospilia.  A  potters'  quarter (C 8l/C7e\u00adC6m)  was  located  near  Mandra  di  Gipari  on  a hillock  opposite  the  west  side  of  the  plateau.  During  the  late Classical  and  Hellenistic  periods  Patela  Prinias  served  as  a fortified guard-post.  For  the  remains  of  the  settlement  at Patela  Prinias,  see  Rizza  ( 1978),  ( 1991),  ( 1995),  ( 2000);  Rizza and  Rizzo  ( 1985);  Rizza  et al.( 1994). 1186 perlman 989.

Allaria  is  included  in  the  Inventory  as  a  probable polis  (type  B)  on  the  strength  of  the  coins,  which  may  be  as early  as  c. 330  (infra).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic occurs  internally  on  the  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  the asylia  decree  (I.Cret. ii.i.1  (C 3l)).The  individual  use  is  attest- ed  in  Polyb. 5.63.12,  65.7  (r 220). The  location  of  Allaria  is  not  certain,  but  is  probably  to  be sought  somewhere  in  west  Crete  near  Eleutherna,  perhaps  at the  eastern  edge  of  the  Rhethymno  plain  in  the  vicinity  of the  villages  of  Khamalevri  and  Stavromenos  (Guarducci ( 1939)  1\u00ad3).  Surface  remains  indicate  that  two  ancient  settle- ments,  one  just  north  of  Khamalevri  and  the  other  on  the coast  at  Palaiokastro,  Stavromenos,  were  occupied  during the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  (S.

Allaria  should  perhaps  be identified w ith  the  site  at  Khamalevri,  and  Pantomatrion with  the  one  at  Stavromenos  (Faure  ( 1988)  85\u00ad86,(1993)  72; cf.

Seneca  reports  that  according  to  Theophrastos,  \"circa Arcadiam,  quae  urbs  in  Creta  insula  fuit,  fontes  et  rivos  sub- stitisse\"  (Sen.  QNat. 3.11.5).  If  Seneca's  translation  of Theophrastos  is  accurate,  this  is  our  earliest  reference  to Arkades  as  a  polis.  The  use  is  either  political  or  topographi- cal  qua  asty.  The  earliest  certain  reference  to  Arkades  as  a polis  occurs  in  the  agreement  of  Miletos  (Milet. i.3140.1,  51  (c. 259\u00ad250)),  in  which the  Arkades  are  included  as  one  of  the   .  The  passage  from  Seneca  and  the  coins  of  Arkades which  may  be  as  early  as  c. 330  (infra)  strongly  indicate  that Arkades  was  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  C 4.However,in so  far  as  we  cannot  be  certain  whether  Seneca  was  quoting rather  than  paraphrasing  Theophrastos  or  whether  the coins  were  struck  in  C 4s,  Arkades  must  remain  a  probable polis  (type  B). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  the  coins  of  C 4s\u00adC3f(infra)  and  externally  in  the  C 3m agreement  of  Miletos        (Milet. i.3140.51).  For  the  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic there  are  \u00b5      and []   []   ,  immigrants  from Arkades  to  Miletos  (Milet. i.338x4,  38bb5  (C 3s)). Arkades  was  located  to  the  south-west  of  Lasithi  in  the eparchy  of  Monofatsi,  but  the  precise  location  of  the  polis town  remains  a  subject  of  controversy.  Levi  suggested  that  the  plural  form  of  the  name  reflected the fact that the community  was  settled  \u00b5,  with  its  principal  centre during  the  Geometric  and  Archaic  periods  at  modern Aphrati  (Levi  ( 1927\u00ad29)  15\u00ad23),  but  this  important  early  set- tlement  is  perhaps  to  be  identified as the polis  town of ancient  Datala  (Viviers  ( 1994)  234\u00ad41).  The  two  inscriptions from  Monofatsi  which  refer  to  Arkades  by  name  (I.Cret. i.v.19A,20A  (both  C 2))  were  found  in  the  vicinity  of  modern Ini,  which  is  situated  in  the  plain  to  the  south-west  of Aphrati.  On  current  evidence  Ini  seems  the  most  likely  loca- tion  for  the  polis  town  of  Arkades,  despite  the  fact  that  there is  very  little  surface  evidence  of  habitation  before  the Roman  period  (Sanders  ( 1982)  151  ( 7/25);  Viviers  ( 1994) 233\u00ad34). Theophrastos  relates  that  Arkades  had  been  destroyed and  resettled,  although  the  passage  as  quoted  by  Seneca  pro- vides  no  indication  of  the  date  of  the  destruction  or  resettle- ment  apart  from  the  floruit  of  Theophrastos  himself (Theophr.  apud  Sen.  QNat. 3.11.5).  Otherwise,  the  evidence for  the  history  and  political  institutions  of  Arkades  dates  to the  Hellenistic  period. Theophrastos  mentions  Arkades  on  account  of  her springs  (Theophr.  apud  Sen.  QNat. 3.11.5).  A  sanctuary  of Asklepios,  probably  to  be  associated  with  these  springs,  and a  festival,  the  Asklapieia,  are  attested  epigraphically  at Arkades  (sanctuary:  I.Cret. i.v.52  (C 3l);  festival:  IC iii.iii.1B (C 3l)).

The  city-ethnic  was  (Thuc. 2.85.5;  cf. Sekunda  ( 2000)  330\u00ad37:  the  term  Polichnitai  is  not  a  city- ethnic  but  rather  the  name  of  a  league  of  small  communities of  west  Crete  whose  population  consisted  largely  of  the descendants  of  the  pre-Greek  ).  The  identification of  the  toponym  Polichne  with  the  ancient  remains  near  the modern  village  of  Vryses,  Kydonia  (Faure  ( 1988)  91;  cf. Guarducci  ( 1939)  233:  Polichna  was  located  at  Meskla)  is  sup- ported  by  (i)  bronze  coins  with  reverse  types  similar  to  those of  Kydonia  which  bear  the  legend  (infra),  and  (ii)  the story  related  by  Thucydides  which  suggests  that  Polichne  and Kydonia  were  neighbours  (Thuc. 2.85.5). Polichne  is  included  in  the  Inventory  as  a  possible  polis (type  C)  chiefly on the e vidence  of  Thucydides  ( 2.85.5\u00ad86.1). In 429  the  Athenians  responded  to  a  request  of  Nikias,  the Gortynian  proxenos  of  Athens,  and  ravaged  the  territory of Kydonia.  Nikias  hoped  in  this  way  to  win  for  Gortyn  the gratitude  of  the  Polichnitai  (Figueira  ( 1988)  538\u00ad42).  The context  and  the  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  suggest  that Polichne  was  a  political  community,  rather  than  a  sub-unit of  another  polis  (cf.  Perlman  ( 1996)  252\u00ad58).  The  passage further  suggests  that  the  relations  between  Polichne  and Kydonia  were  at  times  hostile  and  that  other  Cretan  poleis,in this  case  Gortyn,  took  advantage  of  this.  The  reverse  type (dog)  on  the  bronze  coins  of  Polichne  which  resembles  the reverse  type  of  a  series  of  bronze  fractions  from  Kydonia suggests  that  Kydonia  and  Polichne  were  allies  at  the  time (Stefanakis  ( 1996)). The  ancient  settlement  south  of  the  modern  village  of Vryses,  Kydonia,  extends  across  the  two  peaks  of  Ag. Giorgios  to  the  west  and  Kastellos  to  the  east.  Excavations  on a  modest  scale  and  chance  finds suggest that the area was continuously  occupied  since  the  Middle  Minoan  period. The  ancient  road  up  to  the  double  acropolis  followed  a ravine  from  the  north.  A  wall  along  the  saddle  between  the two  peaks  protected  the  community  from  the  south  (Faure ( 1958)  499\u00ad501,(1963)  21\u00ad22,(1988)  91;  Zo\u00efs  ( 1976);  Nowicki ( 2000)  214\u00ad15).  An  Archaic\u00adClassical  sanctuary  (of Demeter?,  Diktynna?,  a  nymph?)  was  located  on  the  south- ern  slope  of  Kastellos  (Mortzos  ( 1985)).

The  toponym  is  perhaps  to  be  identified w ith the  remains  of  a  fairly  substantial  settlement  on  the  high ground  (Pyrgos)  and  slope  to  the  east  (Kionia)  above  the  sea 2  km  south  of  the  modern  village  of  Kerame  in  Ag.  Vasilios eparchy  (Guarducci  ( 1939)  310;  Hood  and  Warren  ( 1966) 173\u00ad74  no. 8).The  remains  cover  1.5  ha  and  include  a  massive fortification wall w ith  towers.  Surface  pottery  is  principally Classical  and  Hellenistic,  with  smaller  amounts  of Geometric  and  Archaic  material  (Hood  and  Warren  ( 1966) 173\u00ad74;  Coutsinas  ( 2001)  62\u00ad63). 1154 perlman No  ancient  source refers  to Bionnos  as  a  polis.However, the  discovery  at  Pyrgi  of  a  fragment  of  a  C 4l/C3e  treaty (I.Cret. ii.xxx.1)  suggests  that  Bionnos  was  perhaps  a  polis during  the  late  Classical  period.  The  appointment  of  a  theo- rodokos  c. 230\u00ad210  to  host  the  theoroi  sent  out  from  Delphi suggests  the  same  for  the  Hellenistic  period  (BCH 45  ( 1921) iv.13;  Perlman  ( 1995b)  128\u00ad36).  This  evidence  in  combina- tion  with  the  observation  that  the  settlement  near  Kerame was  already  established  in  the  Classical  period  recommends the  inclusion  of  Bionnos  in  the  Inventory  as  a  possible  polis type C.

Lat. 35.20, long. 25.25.  Size  of  territory: 1.  Type:  B.  The  toponym is  attested  only  in  late  literary  sources  (Xenion (FGrHist 460)  fr. 14;Strabo 10.4.14;  Paus. 6.16.5).  The  local spelling  of  the  toponym  was  probably   (Guarducci  ( 1935)  33).  The  city-ethnic  is   (coins,  C 4s\u00adC3e,  infra;  IvO 276  (C 4s);  cf. / at  Steph.  Byz. 692.6\u00ad7). The  earliest  reference  to *Chersonasos  as  a  polis  occurs  in the  agreement  of  Miletos        (Milet. i.3140.1,  36  (c. 259\u00ad250)).  The  term  polis  is  used  in  its topographical  sense  qua totality  of territory of *Chersonasos  in  a  treaty  (alliance?)  between  *Chersonasos and  Rhodos  (SEG 41  768  (C 3l)).  The  mint  of  *Chersonasos, which  may  have  begun  production  as  early  as  c. 330  (infra), and  the  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  around  the  same time  (IvO 276  (C 4s))  strongly  suggest  that  *Chersonasos was  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  by  the  late  Classical  period (Perlman  ( 1996)  246\u00ad52).  Late  authors  refer  to *Chersonasos  as  a  \u00b5  (Stadiasmus 349;Steph. Byz. 692.2\u00ad3). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  the  coins  of  C 4s\u00adC3f(infra),  and  in  Hellenistic  treaties (e.g.  SEG 41  768  (C 3l)).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic is  attested  externally  in  the  agreement  of  Miletos        (Milet. i.3140.36  (c. 259\u00ad250)).  For  the individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  there  is     ,  hemerodromos  and  bema- tistes  of  Asia  for  Alexander  (IvO 276  (C 4s)). The  polis  town  of  *Chersonasos  was  located  to the  south of  a  peninsula  (Kastri)  at  the  foot  of  what  passes  for  an acropolis  (Sanders  ( 1982)  144\u00ad46  ( 6/7)).  Remains  there  date no  earlier  than  C 4,but  two  fragments  of  a  C 6  grave stele  were discovered  1  km  south  of  the  port  near  the  village  of Koutoulophari  at  a  place  called  Hellenika  (LSAG 316  no. 20). Little  is  known  about  the  polis  town  of  Chersonasos.  A  story preserved  in  Plutarch about  the  foundation  of  Lyktos  sug- gests  that  the  coastal  region  where  the  polis  was  located  was called (Plut.  Mor. 247D).Viviers  argues  that *Chersonasos  was  in  some  sense  a  dependency  of  Lyktos already  in  C 6  (Viviers  ( 1994)  252\u00ad54).  If  he  is  right,  Lyktian control  did  not  affect  the  political  status  of  *Chersonasos, since  it  thereafter  minted  coins  (infra)  and  joined  in  inter- national  agreements  (e.g.  Milet. i.3140  (c. 259\u00ad250)),  and  its citizens  were  appointed  proxenoi  by  other  Cretan  poleis (I.Cret. iv  387  (C 2);  I.Cret. i.xix.3  (C 2)).  After  its  sympoliteia with  Lyktos  (I.Cret. i.xix.3A  (c. 183)),  the  two  appear  togeth- er  (Lyktos  and  \"Lyktos  by  the  sea\")  as  signatories  in  inter- state  agreements  (SEG 41  770  (C 2s);  I.Cret. i.xviii.9A ( 111/10)).  For  Strabo,  *Chersonasos  was  the  harbour  of Lyktos:    ...    \u00b5 (Strabo  10.4.14). Although  attested  in  a  Hellenistic  alliance  of  Olous  and Lyktos  (SEG 41  770  (C 2l)),  the  tribal  name  is  likely to  be  early,  and  so  is  mentioned  here.  Strabo  mentions  a sanctuary  of  Britomartis  at  Cherronesos  (Strabo  10.14),  and this  goddess  (or  Artemis-Britomartis),  if  not  the  protecting deity  of  the  polis,  surely  enjoyed  a  state  cult  there  (coin types). *Chersonasos  struck  two  series  of  staters  on  the  Aiginetan standard  during  the  period  c. 330\u00ad280/270  (Le  Rider  ( 1966) 197).

The  city-ethnic  is (I.Cret.iii.vi.7  (C 3f);  cf. ,I.Cret.iii.iv.9, l. 123  (C 2l)). Stalai  is  identified as a polis  in  two  ancient  sources:  (i)  the decree  of  Praisos  concerning  the  Stalitai,  which  secures  for  the Stalitai  the  enjoyment  of  their  chora  and  polis  (I.Cret. iii.vi.7 (C 3f));  and  (ii)  Stephanos  (Steph.  Byz. 585.12).  The  meaning of  the  term  in  the  decree  of  Praisos  is  urban.  This  decree  indi- cates  that  the  Stalitai  possessed  several  of  the  defining c harac- teristics  of  the  polis,  viz.  an  urban  centre  ( ),  a  hinterland ( ) with recognised borders,  the  authority  to  levy  har- bour  taxes  ( \u00b5) and perhaps to tax the purple-dye and  fishing industries,  and  so,  presumably,  the  public  officials required  to  levy  the  taxes  and  spend  or  distribute  the  pro- ceeds.  We  do  not  know  whether  or  not  in  other  respects  the Stalitai  were  self-governing  and  self-regulating,  autonomoi and  autodikai.  On  present  evidence,  Stalai  appears  to have been  a  dependent  community  of  Praisos,  perhaps  a  depend- ent  polis,  at  the  time  of  the  decree  (Chaniotis  ( 1996)  161\u00ad68, 383\u00ad93;  Perlman  ( 1996)  257\u00ad58;  cf.  Gschnitzer  ( 1975)).  The decree  dates  to  C 3f,  and  one  of  its  provisions  specifies that the Stalitai  shall  give  to  Praisos  a  share  of  the  revenue  from  the  fishing industry as they did in the past ( ).If  this  revenue  was  indeed  the  product  of  taxation, we  may  infer  that  for  some  time  the  community  exercised public  authority  in  this  area.  It  is  not  possible  to  fix precisely for  how  long  this  had  been  the  case,  but  the  surface  remains  of the  ancient  settlement  on  Dasonari,  which  is  the  most  likely location  of  Stalai  (Schachermeyer  ( 1938)  479;Chaniotis  ( 1996) 386),  date  to  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  (autopsy).  The evidence  suggests  that  Stalai  may  have  been  a  polis,  albeit  per- haps  a  dependent  polis,  in  the  late  Classical  period,  so  it  is included  in  the  Inventory  as  a  possible  polis  (type  C). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  occurs  externally  in the  decree  of  Praisos  for  the  Stalitai  (I.Cret. iii.vi.7  (C 3f)) and  in  the  arbitration  of  Magnesia  for  Itanos  and Hierapytna  (I.Cret. iii.iv.9.123  (C 2l)). 990.

The  polis  in  question  is  probably  Kydonia,  and  the use  of  the  term  is  probably  political.  Polis  in  the  urban  sense is  attested  in  Ephor.  fr. 29,  in  Ps.-Skylax  47  ( implied; see  Flensted-Jensen  and  Hansen  ( 1996)  142),  and  in  Diod. 16.63.3  (r 343). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  abbreviated  form  on  coins  C 4s\u00adC3e  (infra),  and  external- ly  in  Thucydides'  account  of  the  Athenian  expedition  to Crete in 429  (Thuc. 2.85.5)  and  in  the  list  of  recipients  of grain  from  Kyrene  during  the  grain  crisis  of  the  320s  (SEG 9 2.26).  For  the  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  there  are  the two  signatures  of  sculptors, from  Olympia  (Paus. 5.25.11  (rC 6,not  properly  retrospective if  Pausanias  here  quotes  the  inscription))  and   from  Hermione  (IG iv  683  (C 5m))  and  the graffito of '   from  Abydos  (IGA 3 405  (C 4)). According  to legend,  Kydonia  was  founded  by Minos  or Kydas  (IG xii.5104.21\u00ad22;Diod.  5.78.2;  Paus. 8.53.4).  In  light of  the  continuous  settlement  of  Chania  from  C 8s  (infra),  the story  told  by Herodotos  about  the  foundation  of  Kydonia  by Samian  exiles  ( [Samians]         ) probably refers to a  refoundation  or resettlement  of  the  polis  (Hdt. 3.44.1,  59.1\u00ad3  (r 524);  for  the 1170 perlman meaning  of in  Herodotos,  see  Casewitz  ( 1985)).  The Samians  remained  there  for  five y ears,  but  in  the  sixth  year ( 519),  Aiginetans  and  Cretans  defeated  them  in  a  sea  battle, and  the  Aiginetans  resettled  Kydonia  as  a  colony  (Strabo 8.6.16;  for  the  possible  economic  motives  behind  Samian and  Aiginetan  interest  in  Kydonia,  see  Stefanakis  ( 1999) 250\u00ad57;  for  the  identification of  the  as  the  descen- dants  of  the  pre-Greek  inhabitants  of  west  Crete  and  for their  fate  following  Aigina's  colonisation  of  Kydonia,  see Sekunda  ( 2000)  330\u00ad37).  In  429  the  Athenians  responded  to the  request  of  Nikias,  the  Gortynian  proxenos  of  Athens,  and ravaged  the  territory of  Kydonia  (Thuc. 2.85.5\u00ad86.1).  The attack  may  have  been  motivated  in  part  by  pro-Spartan sympathies  if  not  outright  support  for  Sparta  on  the  part  of the  descendants  of  the  Aiginetan  settlers,  together  perhaps with  more  recent  arrivals  from  Aigina  following  the Athenian  expulsions  in  457/6  and 431  (Figueira  ( 1988) 538\u00ad42).  Phalaikos  was  killed  during  his  unsuccessful  siege of  Kydonia  in  343  (Diod. 16.63;  Paus. 10.2.7). The  list  of  leases  of  land  and  houses  to  seven  proxenoi (I.Cret. ii.x.1  (C 3))  provides  precious  information  about  the organisation  of  the  territory of  Kydonia.  Combined  with  the archaeological  evidence,  it  can  be  used  retrospectively  for the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods.  The  leases  refer  to  vine- yards \u00b5       ,      ,         ,  (Marangou-Lerat  ( 1995)  11\u00ad13:  Akrotiri  peninsula),  ,and   ;  houses   `  and    (  ) \u00b5;  and  fallow  land  \u00b5.The  \u00b5  Laxania  has  been  identified w ith  the substantial  fortified site (Archaic through B yzantine)  on Kastellos  Varypetro  about  7  km  south-west  of  Chania (Faure  ( 1988)  90;  Erickson  ( 2000)  260).  Minoa  has  been identified w ith  the  remains  (Archaic  through  Roman)  of  a large  coastal  settlement  at  modern  Marathi  on  Akrotiri peninsula  (Blackman  ( 1976d)).  The  settlement  possessed  an important  cult  (of  Diktynna?)  at  Marathospelios  (Faure ( 1964)  186\u00ad87)  and  territory  extending  north-west  to  the isthmus  of  the  peninsula  (Marangou-Lerat  ( 1995)  10\u00ad13). Lipara  has  been  identified w ith  one  of  the  small  islands located  in  Souda  Bay  opposite  Marathi  (Guarducci  ( 1939) 117).  For  a  discussion  of  these  toponyms,  see  Perlman  ( 1996) 243\u00ad44,  where  I  distinguish  between  two  types  of  sub-unit of  the  polis:  (i)  villages  like Laxania  and  Hera\u00efs  which  were not  political  units,  and  (ii)  a  second  category  of  community of  which  Minoa,  Molokas,  Vatheia,  Lipara  and  Schinouris are  examples.  These  latter  consisted  of  a  settlement  and  agri- cultural  lands,  including  some  state-owned  parcels,  and may  have  been  political  units  dependent  upon  or  part  of Kydonia. The  continuous  occupation  of  the  city  of  Chania  since  C 8, coupled  with  the  building  activity  of  the  Venetians,  who  dis- mantled  many  of  the  earlier  structures  for  building  material to  reuse  in  their  own  buildings,  has  made  it  difficult t o  recon- struct  the  organisation  of  the  Greek  polis.  Rescue  excavations have  provided  most  of  what  is  known  archaeologically  about the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  (see  e.g.  KrEst 7  ( 1999) 143\u00ad66,  describing  eighteen  rescue  excavations  conducted  in Chania  during  the  period  1995\u00ad97).  Late  Geometric  material from  Kastelli  Hill  suggests  that  the  Greek  settlement  was established  there  in  C 8  (Andreadaki-Vlasaki  ( 1997)  239;for Archaic  and  Classical  deposits  on  Kastelli,  see  Hallager  et al. ( 1997)  202\u00ad4;  Hahn  ( 1997)  209;  ArchDelt 45  ( 1990)  Chron. 433\u00ad35).  Kastelli  perhaps  served  as  the  acropolis  for  the  com- munity.  Literary  testimonia  indicate  that  the  urban  centre was  fortified during the late Classical and H ellenistic  periods (Diod. 16.63.3  (r 343);  Polyb. 4.55.4  (r 220\u00ad219)).  It  is  likely, though  not  certain,  that  these  fortifications protected the acropolis.  The  extent  of  the  Classical  and  Hellenistic  urban centre  is  suggested  by  the  location  of  graves  dating  to  these periods  within  the  limits  of  the  modern  city  in  the  areas  of Ag.  Ioannis,  the  law  courts,  the  public  park  and  the  stadium (Pologiorgi  ( 1985)).  No  public  buildings  of  the  Greek  polis have  been  discovered,  although  it  seems  likely  that  there  was a  temple  near  Plataia  in  1866,  where  the  fragment  of  an Archaic  limestone  frieze  now  on  display  in  the Archaeological  Museum  of  Chania  (Inv.  no. 92)  was  found (Theophanides  ( 1956)).  Herodotos  records  that  the  Samian exiles  who  refounded  or  resettled  Kydonia  built  the  temples which  were  still  there  in  his  day,  as  well  as  the  temple  of Diktynna  on  Rhodopou  Peninsula  (                   ,  Hdt. 3.59.1\u00ad3  (r 524)).  Onorio  Belli  reported having  seen  a  temple  with  a  Doric  portico,  a  theatre  and  an aqueduct,  although  both  the  locations  and  the  dates  of  these structures  are  today  unknown  (Falkener  ( 1854)  27\u00ad28).  It seems  likely  that  the  ancient  harbour  was  in  the  same  place  as the  Venetian  harbour  to  the  north  of  Kastelli,  and  that  the Venetian  mole  was  built  on  an  earlier  mole.  Skylax  reports that  the  harbour  of  Kydonia  could  be  closed  (Ps.-Skylax  47). Kydonia  struck  pseudo-Aiginetan  hemidrachms  and obols  (c. 475\u00ad280),  distinguished  from  Aiginetan  coins  by fabric,  style  and  the  frequent  representation  of  a  crescent  on either  obverse  or  reverse.  Types:  obv.  tortoise;  rev.  incuse square  (Robinson  ( 1928);  Le  Rider  ( 1966)  173;  SNG  Cop. Aeg.Isl. 402\u00ad5).  During  the  period  c. 320\u00ad280/270,  Kydonia crete  1171 struck  coins  (staters,  drachms,  obols),  also  on  the  Aiginetan standard  but  with  different  types  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  194). Staters  have obv.  head  of  a  nymph  or  goddess  (Frost  ( 1996): Akakallis?);  rev.  youthful  naked  archer  stringing  his  bow,  or hound  suckling  an  infant  (Kydon).  Drachms  have  (i)  obv. head  of  a  nymph  or  goddess;  rev.  naked  hunter,  or  dog  feed- ing  Kydon;  (ii)  obv.  head  of  Athene;  rev.  dog  feeding  Kydon. Obols  have  (i)  obv.  head  of  a  youth  with  horns;  rev.  dog;  (ii) obv.  head  of  a  nymph  or  goddess;  rev.  head  of  a  bull,  or  ,or dot  within  three  crescent  moons,  or  dot  within  three  dotted crescent  moons;  (iii)  obv.  head  of  nymph  or  goddess;  rev. amphora.

Leg. 753A),  in  Linear  B,  ko-no-so (McArthur  ( 1993)  21\u00ad23).  According  to  Strabo,  Knosos  was formerly  called  ,  the  ancient  name  (now  revived) of  the  river  and  river  valley  wherein  Knosos  is  located (Strabo  10.4.8).  The  city-ethnic  is  (coins,  C 4f,  see infra;  SEG 92.31,  59  (C 4s)).  Literary  sources  use  both  these and  geminated  forms  of  the  toponym  ( ,Di od. 16.62.3)  and  the  city-ethnic  ( ,  Hdt. 3.122.2). Geminated  forms  do  not  appear  in  the  inscriptions. Knosos  is  called  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  the  agree- ment  of  Knosos,  Tylisos  and  Argos  which  provides  for  the division  of  booty    \u00b5   ... (ML 42B.31\u00ad32  (C 5m)  Nomima i54.ii).  It  is  most  likely  that Knosos  should  be  understood  as  one  of  the  poleis.  In  literary sources  Knosos  is  called  a  polis  both  in  the  political  sense  (Pl. Leg. 702C,  752E)  and  in  the  urban  sense  (Hymn.  Hom.  Ap. 477;Bacchyl.  1.123,  in  both  cases  in  a  mythological  context). The  phrase   \u017d  occurs  in  Pind.  Ol. 12.16. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  the  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  the  agreement  of Knosos,  Tylisos  and  Argos  (ML  42B.8  (C 5m)),  in  the  proxe- ny  decree  of  Mausolos  and  Artemisia  for  the  Knosioi (I.Labraunda 40  (C 4m)),and  in  the  list  of  recipients  of  grain from  Kyrene  during  the  grain  crisis  of  the  320s  (SEG 92.31, 59).  For  the  individual  use  there  is  the  sculptor  \u00b5    who  made  the  statue  of  Battos  and Libya  riding  in  a  chariot  which  Pausanias  saw  at  Delphi (Paus. 10.15.7  (rC 5)).  The  individual  use  is  not  attested  epi- graphically  before  C 4  (     ,  IG ii\u00b2 9044  (C 4f)). Very  little  is  known  about  the  Archaic  and  Classical  (pre- C 4m)  history  of  Knosos.  According  to  Strabo,  in  the  time  of Homer  and  for  a  long  while  thereafter  Knosos  was  the  most illustrious  polis  on  Crete.  She  later  lost  her  leading  position to  Gortyn  and  Lyktos,  but  managed  to recover  her  former status  as  the  metropolis  of  Crete  (Strabo  10.4.7).  Pindar indicates  that  Knosos  suffered  a  period  of  stasis  in  C 5e, which  resulted  in  the  exile  or  immigration  to  Himera  of  the long-distance  runner  ' ,twice victor at  the  Pythian  Games  and  once  at  the  Olympian  (Pind.  Ol. 12.16  (C 5f)).  Knosos  is  not  known  to  have  produced  other Panhellenic  victors,  but  Knosos  and  Tylisos  agreed  to  dedi- cate  jointly  at  Delphi  a  tithe  of  the  booty  they  captured together  (ML  42B.7\u00ad10  (C 5m)).  Knosos  and  Tylisos  formed an  alliance  in  C 5m  (ML  42).  The  assembly  of  Argos  (  ~) served as the mediator in the resolution of  disputes between  the  two  poleis  concerning  questions  of  war  and peace  (ML  42A.6\u00ad17;  Merrill ( 1991);  cf.  ML:  the  text  implies a  federal  structure  with  a  federal  assembly  called   ~ which  decided  questions  of  war  and  peace;  members included  Knosos,  Tylisos  and  Argos,  and  perhaps  other states  as  well  ( \u00b5 ,M L 42B.31\u00ad32);  cf. Gschnitzer  ( 1958)  44\u00ad47:ML  42  is  an  alliance  between Knosos  and  Argos;  Tylisos  is  a  dependency  of  Argos).  The border  between  Knosos  and  Tylisos  (   ) is described  in  this  alliance  ( 26\u00ad29,  infra),  and  regulations concerning  property  and  trade  are  stipulated:  (i)  both  poleis are  prohibited  from  absorbing  territory ( ) belonging to  the  other  ( 25\u00ad26);  (ii)  Knosioi  are  prohibited  from  owning land  in  Tylisos  ( \u00b5  '),  although  a  Tylisios  may own  land  in  Knosos  ( 23\u00ad25);  (iii)  export  from  Tylisos  to Knosos  and  from  Knosos  to  Tylisos  is  tax-free;  (iv)  Tylisioi pay  the  same  taxes  as  citizens  of  Knosos  for  trans-shipment from  Knosos  ( 11\u00ad14).  After  a  gap  in  the  historical  record  of almost  a  century,  evidence  for  the  history  of  Knosos  resumes in  C 4m,  when  Mausolos  and  Artemisia  issue  a  proxeny decree  for  the  Knosioi  (I.Labraunda 40  (c. 357)),  and  Knosos hires  mercenaries  of  Phalaikos  for  a  campaign  against Lyktos  (Diod. 16.62  ( 346)),  and  honours  the  Athenians  with a  gold  crown  (IG ii\u00b2  1443.ii.121\u00ad22  ( 345/4)). The \u00b5  appear  to  have  been  the  chief  magistrates  of the  polis  already  in  the  Classical  period.  They  were  responsi- ble  for  providing  foreign  envoys  with  .The  over- saw  the  \u00b5  (ML 42B.40\u00ad42  (C 5m)).  Although  the phylai  appear  only  in  Hellenistic  sources,  they  are  likely  to  be early  and  so  are  mentioned  here.  Five  tribal  names  are  attest- ed:  (i)  or (I.Cret. i.viii.10  (C 2e);  SEG 33  729 (C 1);  cf.  the  sanctuary  of  the  hero  at  Archanes,  ML 42B.27,  35\u00ad36  (C 5m));  (ii)  \u00b5  (I.Cret. iv  181  (C 2f)); (iii) [---c.8---] (I.Cret.  iv  182  (C 2f));  (iv)  (I.Cret. iv  197  (C 2));  (v)  `  (SEG 33  728  (C 1)). The  territory  of  Knosos  is  called  (in  Argolic)   h   (ML 42A.21\u00ad22  (C 5m)).  If  the  river  mentioned  in  the C 5m  description  of  the  border  of  Knosos  and  Tylisos  is  the Platyperama  (ML  42B.28),  the  territory  of  Knosos  reached the  north  coast  between  Herakleion  and  Apellonia.  To  the east  her  territory  encompassed  the  sanctuary  of  Zeus Thenatas  at  Amnisos  (Chaniotis  ( 1992)),  while  to  the  south it  extended  towards  modern  Archanes  (ML  42B.2\u00ad4;see Huxley  ( 1994)  126\u00ad27  for  a  brief  discussion  of  the  territory; cf.  also  I.Cret. i.ix.1B.52  for  a  C 3  reference  to the  borders crete  1169 ( ) of  Knosos,  and  I.Cret. iv  182  and  Polyb. 22.15.1  for the  C 2f  border  of  Knosos  and  Gortyn).  Strabo  identifies Herakleion  and  earlier  (in  the  time  of  Minos)  Amnisos  as the  harbours  ( ) of  Knosos  (Strabo  10.4.7\u00ad8).  The so-called  cave  of  Eleithyia  was  located  within  the  territory  of Knosos  (see  e.g.  Paus. 1.18.5;Strabo 10.4.8). The  polis  town  of  Knosos  seems  to  have  enjoyed  nearly continuous  habitation  from  prehistoric  times  and  always  to have  been  settled  as  an  urban  centre  with  the  important exception  of  the  period  c. 630\u00ad525,when  on  current  evidence the  settlement  appears  to  have  been  largely  abandoned (Coldstream  ( 1984);  Coldstream  and  Huxley  ( 1999)).  Very little  is  known  about  the  polis  town  of  Archaic  and  Classical Knosos  (for  the  Archaic  and  Classical  remains  within  the urban  centre  of  Knosos,  see  Hood  and  Smyth  ( 1981); Coldstream  and  Macdonald  ( 1997);  Coldstream  ( 1999), ( 2000)).  According  to  Strabo,  the  circuit  of  the  ancient  city was 30  stadia  (Strabo  10.4.7),  but  there  is  no  archaeological evidence  that  a  circuit  wall  protected  the  polis  town.  For a Classical  fort  (C 4)  on  Kefala  ridge  north  of  the  Minoan Palace,  see  Hood  and  Boardman  ( 1957).  The  public  centre  of the  polis  town  is  suspected  to  have  been  in  the  region  of  the Roman  Civil  Basilica,  c. 0.5  km  to  the  north-west  of  the Minoan  palace,  where  architectural  blocks  bearing  the  text (painted)  of  a  law  were  found  (I.Cret. i.viii.5  (C 3)).  Three early  sanctuaries  have  been  excavated:  (i)  of  Rhea?  (C 5  and earlier?)  above  the  ruins  of  the  South  Propylaion  of  the Minoan  palace  (Evans  ( 1928)  3\u00ad5;  Coldstream  ( 2000) 284\u00ad88);  (ii)  of  Demeter  (from  C 8  onwards)  south  of  the Minoan  palace  on  Lower  Gipsades  Hill  (Coldstream  ( 1973)); (iii)  of  Glaukos?  (from  c. 500)  west  of  the  Minoan  palace (Callaghan  ( 1978)).  Deposits  of  Archaic  (with  the  C 6  gap) and  Classical  material,  but  no  architecture,  have  been  found in  the  Stratigraphical  Museum  excavations  (Warren ( 1984\u00ad85)),  above  the  Unexplored  Mansion  (Sackett  ( 1992) 6\u00ad8),  to  the  south-west  of  the  Minoan  palace  (Coldstream and  Macdonald  ( 1997)),and  on  both  sides  of  the  Royal  Road (Coldstream  ( 1973)).  There  is  almost  no  burial  evidence from  Knosos  later  than  c. 630  (Coldstream  and  Huxley ( 1999)  294\u00ad96). Knosos  struck  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard  from c.C 5m  (Price  ( 1981),  c. 450\u00ad425;  Le  Rider  ( 1966)  175\u00ad80,  195, c. 425).  The  earliest  (c.C 5m\u00adC4m)  coins  (staters,  drachms, hemidrachms)  have  obv.  Minotaur;  rev.  labyrinth  (cruci- form),  or  rarely  the  head  of  a  youth  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  66  no. 11:  Theseus  or  Apollo?);  obols  have  obv.  Minotaur;  rev.  star; legend  (on  staters  only):  none  at  first,  later  written retrograde  in  the  epichoric  alphabet  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pl. IV. 23\u00ad32,  with  Le Rider  ( 1966)  175;  SNG  Cop.  Aeg.Isl. 368). The  next  series  of  staters  (c. 340/330\u00ad320)  has  obv.  female head  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  15  n. 5:  Pasipha\u00ef,  Britomartis  or Ariadne?);  rev.  seated  male  figure (Zeus or M inos),  or  a bull's  head  within  the  labyrinth;  legend: ,  or  in one  case  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pls.

Drachms  of  this  period  have  (i)  obv.  head  of  Hera;  rev. labyrinth;  (ii)  head  of  Apollo;  rev.  Zeus  Nikephoros  seated inside  the  labyrinth.  Hemidrachms  and  obols  have  obv.  head of  Apollo;  rev.  labyrinth  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pls.  V. 2\u00ad22, VI. 1\u00ad9,  15\u00ad16,  with  Le Rider  ( 1966)  176\u00ad80;  SNG Cop.

Guarducci  suggests  that  Aulon  was  a  suburb  of  Gortyn,  in part  because  one  likely  location  for  the  community  is  Ag. Deka,  just  2  km  east  of  the  heart  of  the  Roman  city (Guarducci  ( 1950)  30\u00ad31).  Others  identify  Aulon  as  a  perioi- kic  community  of  Gortyn  (e.g.  Larsen  ( 1936)  16;  Willetts ( 1955)  39;  Nomima i52).An  early  honorary  decree  (I.Cret. iv 64  (C 5e))  suggests  that  Aulon  was  a  dependent  polis  of Gortyn,  and  so  recommends  the  inclusion  of  Aulon  in  the Inventory  as  a  possible  polis  (type  C). The  decree  is  enacted  by     and     ~   ,  the  latter  phrase  presumably  indicat- 1152 perlman ing  the  political  body,  perhaps  the  assembly,  empowered  to make  public  decisions  on  behalf  of  the  community.  From the  text  we  learn  the  following  about  the  community  at Aulon:  (i)  the  community  consisted  of  an  \"urban\"  centre,  a hinterland  with  recognised  boundaries,  and  perhaps  small- er  settlements  in  the  hinterland  (Manganaro  ( 1974)  54\u00ad56); (ii)       ~   were  responsible  for  the  dis- position  of  real  property  within  their  community;  (iii)  they enjoyed  their  own  laws  regarding  its  disposition;  and  (iv) they,  like  the  citizens  of  the  other  (dependent poleis)  of  Gortyn,  were  subject  to  judicial  procedures  per- taining  to foreigners  (  ) in Gortyn.  On  the other  hand,  Gortyn  was  able  to dispose  of  property within the  community  and  to  grant  its  public  benefactor  the  right to  sue  as  a  Gortynian  citizen  subject  there  to  the  procedures of  ,  suits  pertaining  to  citizens  (Perlman ( 1996)  266\u00ad68). 950.Axos  (Axios) Map  60.  Lat. 35.20;long.  24.50.  Size  of territory: 2.  Type:  A.  Within  Crete  the  toponym  is  either (I.Cret. ii.v.20B  (C 3l))  or  (SEG 23  563.14  (C 3)). The  city-ethnic  is  either  (coins,  C 4,  infra;  I.Cret. ii.v.17  (C 3l))  or  (coins,  c. 330\u00ad270,  infra;  SEG 23  563.3 (C 3)).  Outside  Crete  the  initial  is  frequently  represented with  the  omikron,  e.g. ,  (Hdt. 4.154.3;  BCH 45  ( 1921) iii.120  (c. 230\u00ad210))  and  '  (IG ii\u00b2  9087  (C 3)),  but forms  with  initial  digamma  ( ,IG  ix\u00b2.16.11  (C 3f))  and alpha  ( ,  IG vii  3197  (C 1e))  are  also  attested. Herodotos  refers  to Axos  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in his  narration  of  the  foundation  of  Cyrene  (Hdt. 4.154.1 (rC 7l)).  The  earliest  contemporary  references  to  Axos  as  a polis  occur  in  an  early  public  enactment  (I.Cret. ii.v.1 (C 6\u00adC5)).  The  term  appears  twice  in  the  text,  once  in  its political  sense  ( 6\u00ad7)  and  once  where  its  meaning  is  ambigu- ous  ( 10\u00ad11)  and  may  be  either  political  (\"deposit  with  the polis\")  or  urban  (\"store  in  the  polis\").  For  polis  in  the  urban sense,  see  Ps.-Skylax  47,  where  Oaxos  is  listed  under  the heading      . The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally first on the c oins  of  C 4  (infra)  and  later  in  several  C 3  inscrip- tions  (e.g.  SEG 23  563  (C 3s);  I.Cret. ii.v.20B  (C 3l)).  The  col- lective  use  is  first attested e xternally  in  C 3  as  well  (e.g.  I.Cret. iv  170).For  the  individual  use  there  is  the  C 3  grave stele  from Athens  of  \u00b5    (IG ii\u00b2 9087). Axos  probably  shared  borders  with  Tylisos  and  Knosos  to the  east,  with  Gortyn  to  the  south-east,  and  with  Eleutherna  to the  west.  One  of  the  Archaic  inscriptions  from  Axos  has  been identified as a t reaty  (I.Cret. ii.v.6  (C 6\u00adC5)).If  so,  this  is  one  of the  few  Archaic  treaties  from  Crete.  The  borders  of  Axos  (        ) are mentioned in a  description  of  the borders  of  Gortyn  and  Knosos  (I.Cret. iv  182  (C 2f)). According  to  Herodotos,  Axos  was  ruled  by  a  , Etearchos  (Hdt. 4.154\u00ad55).  Etearchos  was  the  maternal grandfather  of  Battos,  the  oikistes  of  Kyrene,  and  so  his  reg- num--if  historical--should be placed in C 8s  or  C 7f.  This  is the  only  attestation  of  a  post-Minoan  king  on  Crete.  The inscriptions  of  Axos  refer  to  the  (I.Cret. ii.v.9 (C 6\u00adC5))  and  \u00b5  (e.g.  I.Cret. ii.v.6  (C 6s),  9  (C 6s);  Bile ( 1988)  36\u00ad37.27  (C 6l);  SEG 23  565  (C 5\u00adC4)).  The  board  of \u00b5  appears  to  consist  of  three  (or  four?)  members  in  a lex  sacra  of  C 4l  (SEG 23  566.11\u00ad12,  with  van  Effenterre  ( 1989) 6).  The  term  \u00b5  (\"kosmos  elect\"  or  \"ex-kosmos\") occurs  in  this  same  inscription  (SEG 23  566.14;  Bile  ( 1988) 274).  The  term  ~  occurs  in  one  of  the  Archaic  inscrip- tions  (I.Cret. ii.v.1.2  (C 6s)),  and  what  is  perhaps  part  of  an enactment  formula  occurs  in  the  lex  sacra  of  C 4l,     /  \"and  (the  following)  decree  pleased  the tribes\"  (SEG 23  566.12\u00ad13,  with  van  Effenterre  ( 1989)  6\u00ad7); but  the  earliest  fully  preserved  enactment  formula  is Hellenistic:      \u00b5    \u00b5   \u00b5  (I.Cret. ii.v.17  (C 3l)).  Here refers  to the  assembly.  The  term occurs  in this  same  inscription  ( 6).The  Archaic  laws  demonstrate  that the  polis  had  the  authority  to  fine its magistrates ( I.Cret. ii.v.9  (C 6s))  and  to  grant  individuals  tax  exemption  and  sus- tenance  at  public  expense  (I.Cret. ii.v.1.2\u00ad3,  14\u00ad15  (C 6s)). Free  non-citizens,  in  this  case  citizens  of  another  polis, may  be  indicated  by  the  phrase  (\"foreign- ers  or  citizens\"),  which  occurs  in  an  uncertain  context  in  the lex  sacra  of  C 4l  (SEG 23  566.7).  This  same  text  preserves  the terms and (SEG 23  566.12,  17).  A  Hellenistic inscription  preserves  part  of  the  name  of  one  of  the  tribes,  [- --] (I.Cret. ii.v.28  (C 3l/C2e)).  The  name  is  clearly  a patronymic,  and  as  such  is  unparalleled  elsewhere  on  Crete (Jones,  POAG 223).The  name  of  a  second  tribe  or  perhaps  of another  civic  subdivision, ,occurs in an Archaic lex  sacra  (I.Cret. ii.v.9  (C 6s);  cf.  Guarducci  ( 1939)  57,  sive  fes- tum  sunt  sive  gens). The  polis  town  occupied  the  hill  above  the  modern  village of  Axos  and  extended  north-east  toward  Livadhia.  A  resid- ential  district  (Hellenistic)  and  a  cemetery  (some  Archaic graves,  but  principally  Hellenistic  and  Roman)  lay  to  the south  of  the  acropolis  (KrEst 4  ( 1991\u00ad93)  266\u00ad68).  The undated  acropolis  fortifications appear not t o  have  formed  a  complete  circuit,  but  rather  to  have  been  built  where  the crete  1153 natural  defences  of  the  acropolis  were  inadequate  (Taramelli ( 1899)  312).  The  masonry  is  polygonal.  Two  Archaic  temples, one  on  the  acropolis  (Temple  I)  and  a  second  below  it  to  the east  (Temple  II),  were  excavated  in  1899  (Levi  ( 1930\u00ad31) 44\u00ad57).  Some  of  the  Archaic  laws  of  Axos  were probably inscribed  on  their  walls  (Guarducci  ( 1939)  48;Jeffery ( 1949\u00ad50)  34\u00ad36).  The  protecting  deity  of  Axos  was  probably Apollo,  perhaps  surnamed  Axios  (Hsch. 614:  ), whose  son  the  eponymous  ancestor  of  the  polis,  Oaxos,  was said  to  have  been  (Guarducci  ( 1939)  42\u00ad44).  Temple  I  may have  belonged  to  him  (Perlman  ( 2000)  73).  Temple  II  has been  attributed  to  Aphrodite  on  the  basis  of  the  votive  fig- urine  types  (Levi  ( 1930\u00ad31)  50;  Rizza  ( 1967\u00ad68)  291\u00ad93). Other  public  buildings  include  a  large  cistern  located  on  the acropolis  to  the  north-west  of  Temple  I  (Levi  ( 1930\u00ad31)  48) and  an  andreion  which  is  attested  epigraphically  (I.Cret. ii.v.1 (C 6s),  25  (C 4\u00adC3)).  Part  of  a  residential  district  (Archaic?) was  excavated  south-west  of  Temple  I  (Levi  ( 1930\u00ad31)). Axos  struck  coins  (staters,  drachms,  hemidrachms, obols),  on  the  Aiginetan  standard  during  the  period c. 380/370\u00ad280/270.  Earlier  coins  (c. 380/370\u00ad330)  have  obv. head  of  Apollo;  rev.  tripod;  legend  (on  some  coins  only): monogram  or written  retrograde  in  the  epi- choric  alphabet  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pl.  II. 30\u00ad34,  with  Le Rider ( 1966)  197).  Later  coins  (c. 330\u00ad280/270)  have  obv.  head  of Apollo;  rev.  tripod;  legend: or  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pls.  II. 38,  III. 1\u00ad3,  with  Le Rider  ( 1966)  197). 951.  *Biannos  (Biannios) Map  60.  Lat. 35.05,long.  25.25. Size of  territory: 2.  Type:  C.  The  city-ethnic  is   (I.Cret. i.vi.1  (C 3l),  2  (C 2m);  I.Cret. iv  179  (c. 183)).  The toponym  must  have  been  the  unattested  * . Stephanos  preserves  the  spelling  (Steph.  Byz. 168.16),  perhaps  in  confusion  with  the  Roman  port  of  this name  which  was  located  on  the  south-west  coast  of  Crete (Stadiasmus 320). No  Archaic  or  Classical  source  calls  *Biannos  a  polis.The earliest  sources  to  do  so  are  Hellenistic  (I.Cret. i.vi.1  (C 3l),  2 (C 2m)).  The  term  is  used  in  its  political  sense  in  both inscriptions.  In  so  far  as  *Biannos  evidently  was  not  a Hellenistic  foundation,  the  evidence  for  its  political  status, albeit  late,  suggests  that  Biannos  was  a  polis  during  the Classical  period  as  well  (for  the  possibility  that  Lyktos  had absorbed  *Biannos  as  it  extended  its  territory  south  to  the coast,  see  Viviers  ( 1994)  255\u00ad56,  whose  argument  largely depends  upon  taking  the  statement  of  Ps.-Skylax  47,  \u00b5  ,       \u00b5,to mean  \"reached  to  either  coast  (north  and  south)\"). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  the  asylia  decree  for  Teos  (I.Cret. i.vi.1  (C 3l))  and  in  its renewal  (I.Cret. i.vi.2  (C 2m)),  and  externally  in  the  alliance of  *Biannos  and  the  members  of  the  Cretan  koinon  with Eumenes  II  (I.Cret. iv  179  (c. 183)).  The  individual  use  of  the city-ethnic  is  not  attested. The  name  of  the  territory  is  (I.Cret. iv  174.32 (C 3l/C2e)).  *Biannos  probably  shared  a  border  with Hierapytna  to  the  east  (I.Cret. iv  174  (C 3l/C2e)).  The  polis town  was  located  on  a  hill  (Chorakia)  immediately  to  the north-west  of  modern  Vianno,  where  sherds  of  all  periods from  Orientalising  through  Roman  have  been  reported  (S. Hood  et al.( 1964)  83).  A  Hellenistic  inscription  refers  to  the prytaneion  (I.Cret. i.vi.2  (C 2m)).  In  so  far  as  the  prytaneion is  attested  elsewhere  on  Crete  during  the  Classical  period (see  Lato,  infra),  it  is  possible  that  also  at  *Biannos  the  pry- taneion  was  pre-Hellenistic.  The  polis  town  of  *Biannos  was the  closest  urban  centre  to  the  important  sanctuary  of Hermes  and  Aphrodite  at  Symi,  and  communications between  the  sanctuary  and  the  town  were  relatively  easy. These  topographic  considerations  suggest  that  the  sanctu- ary  was  located  within  the  territory  of  *Biannos,  but  there  is no  explicit  evidence  for  this,  and  the  inscriptions,  especially the  dedications,  from  Symi  suggest  that  the  sanctuary  was  in some  sense  \"pan-Cretan\"  (cf.  Chaniotis  ( 1988)  33\u00ad34).  The protecting  deity  of  the  polis  was  probably  Ares,  to  whom  the Biannioi  offered  a  sacrifice called the  \u00b5  (Steph. Byz. 168.19\u00ad20)  and  in  whose  sanctuary  the  public  enact- ments  of  the  polis  were  displayed  (I.Cret. i.vi.1  (C 3l),  2 (C 2m)). Coins  struck  by  *Biannos  are  all  Hellenistic  (Guarducci ( 1935)  29;  Svoronos  ( 1890)  43). 952. ", "Apellonia": "Identifier: 947. , (Apelloniatas) Map  60.  Lat. 35.25,long. 25.00.Located  at  Ag.  Pelagia  on  the  north  coast  of  Crete,  c. 20 km  west  of  Herakleion  (Alexiou  ( 1984);  cf.  Faure  ( 1963) 16\u00ad17,(1993)  70).

The  city-ethnic  is   (I.Cret. iv  182  (c. 165))  or  (Milet. i.3140.37 (c. 259\u00ad250)). The  earliest  reference  to  Apellonia  as  a  polis  in  the  polit- ical  sense  occurs  in  a  C 3m  agreement  of  Miletos  (Milet. i.3140.1,  37).  Polybios  pro- vides  the  earliest  reference  to  Apellonia  as  a  polis  in  its urban  sense  (Polyb. 28.14  (r 171/0)).  Apellonia's  unquestion- able  status  as  a  polis  during  the  Hellenistic  period  com- bined  with  the  identification  of  a  building  at  Ag.  Pelagia (with  phases  in  the  Archaic  period  and  in  C 4\u00adC3)asa  pry- taneion  (infra)  recommend  the  inclusion  of  Apellonia  in the  Inventory  as  a  possible  polis  (type  C)  of  the  Archaic  and Classical  periods. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally in  the  C 3m  agreement  of  Miletos         (Milet. i.3140.37).  For  the  individual  use  of  the  city- ethnic  there  is      ,  member  of a  theoria  to  Alexandria  (SEG 24  1175  ( 233)). The  territory  of  Apellonia  is  called  or    (I.Cret. iv  181  (c. 168),  182 (c. 165)). 1150 perlman A  large  public  building  ( 15  m 6.30  m)  of  C 4\u00adC3,orient- ed  east\u00adwest,  with  two  internal  hearths,  one  at  the  east  end and  the  other  at  the  west,  has  been  identifed  as  a  prytaneion (Alexiou  ( 1975)).This  building,  which  was  destroyed  in  C 2e, no  doubt  by  the  Kydonians  (Polyb. 28.14  (r 171/0)),  overlies an  Archaic  (C 6)  structure  with  an  eschara.  The  existence  of  a prytaneion  at  Apellonia  in  the  Hellenistic  period  is  indicated by  the  promise  of  state  hospitality,  presumably  in  the  prytaneion,  for  visiting  ambassadors,        (I.Cret. i.iii.1 (C 3l)).  The  protecting  deity  of  Apellonia  was  Apollo (Dekataphoros?)  in  whose  sanctuary  the  public  enactments of  the  polis  were  displayed  (I.Cret. i.iii.1  (C 3l)).

Pelagia  of  two  Archaic  bronze  lebetes,one inscribed  with  a  dedication  to  Apollo  (SEG 34  913  (c. 500)),in a  votive  context  may  mark  the  location  of  this  sanctuary (Karetsou  ( 1978)). 947. ", "Dragmos": "Identifier: 956. , (Dragmios) Map  60.  Lat. 35.10,long.  26.10. Size of  territory: 1.  Type:  C.  The  toponym  is  \u00b5 (Xenion  (FGrHist 460)  fr. 4).  The  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5 (I.Cret. iii.iv.9,  lines 58,  68  (rC 3f);  I.Cret. iii.iv.10,l.  12  (C 2l)). The  only  source  to  identify  Dragmos  as  a  polis  is  Steph. Byz. 238.6  quoting  Xenion  for  the  toponym  ((FGrHist 460) fr. 4).  It  is  uncertain  whether  the  site-classification polis stems  from  Xenion's  work.  Dragmos  possessed  a  territory ( ) and shared a border with Itanos which was defined in  a  treaty  between  the  two  communities.  The  border  with Itanos  followed  the  course  of  the  river  Sedamnos  (modern Kokhlakies?,  which  empties  into  Karumes  Bay  about  5  km south  of  Palaikastro)  (I.Cret. iii.iv.9,  59\u00ad61  (rC 3f);  Faure ( 1963)  18).In  so  far  as  there  is  very  little  evidence  on  Crete  for the  existence  of  territorial  sub-units  of  the  polis  (komai  vel sim.),  the  fact  that  Dragmos  had  both  a  territory  and  bor- ders  and  that  it  entered  into  a  treaty  in  C 3f  demonstrates that  the  community  was  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  the early  Hellenistic  period.  The  location  of  the  polis  town of Dragmos  is  not  known.  Map  60  identifies the polis  town of Dragmos  with  the  remains  of  a  fortified settlement on Koutsoulopetres  (Kastri).  Visible  remains  include  sherds from  the  Geometric  through  Hellenistic  periods,  fortifica- tion  walls  with  towers,  house  walls,  cisterns  and  tombs (BCH 79  ( 1955)  Chron. 307\u00ad9;  Faure  ( 1963)  18;  cf.  Chaniotis ( 1996)  184,  who  prefers  Epano  Zakro  on  the  grounds  that Koutsoulopetres  is  too  far  north).  If  this  identification is correct,  the  record  of  the  settlement  during  the  earlier  peri- ods  suggests  that  Dragmos  may  already  have  been  a  polis  in the  political  sense  by  the  late  Classical  period.  On  the strength  of  this  evidence,  Dragmos  is  included  in  the Inventory  as  a  possible  polis  (type  C). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  in  the  arbi- tration  of  Magnesia  for  Itanos  and  Hierapytna  (I.Cret. iii.iv.9,ll.  58,  68  (rC 3f));  the  use  is  probably  external. Praisos  absorbed  Dragmos  (I.Cret. iii.iv.9,ll.  61\u00ad65).  The date  of  the  absorption  of  Dragmos  by  Praisos  has  as  its  ter- minus  post  quem  perhaps  the  period  270\u00ad260  (Perlman ( 1995a)  165). 956. ", "Datala": "Identifier: 955. , (Datales) Map  60.  Unlocated.  Type:  A.  The toponym  is  not  fully  preserved  in  any  ancient  source.  It  has been  restored  [  ] (I.Cret.  i.xvi.5,l.  64  (C 2l)),  but  is written  in  a  facsimile  edition  of  a  lost  copy  of this  treaty  which  was  reported  to  have  come  from  Kydonia (Chaniotis  ( 1996)  367  no. 61.142).  This  same  spelling  has been  restored  [  ()] in an Archaic law from Lyktos (SEG 35  991B4  (C 6)).  The  city-ethnic  was  written   crete  1155 (nom.  sing.)  (Prakt  ( 1973)  191  (C 6)), (dat.  pl.) (SEG 27  631  (C 6l)).  These  latter  two  inscriptions  are  likely  to have  been  written  in  the  dialect  of  Datala  and  so  preserve  the correct  spelling  without  consonantal  gemination. Datala  was  located  somewhere  in  north  central  Crete between  Knosos  and  Lato,  but  the  precise  location  remains unknown.  Map  60  locates  Datala  in  the  Lasithi  plain  at Pinakiano  (Ag.  Giorgios  Papoura).  Viviers  ( 1994)sub- sequently  identified Datala w ith  the  remains  of  the  substantial early  settlement  at  Aphrati  (Prophitis  Elias).  Viviers'  case  is  a strong  one,  but  on  present  evidence  certainty  is  not  possible. The  term  polis  occurs  in  the  enactment  formula  of  the Spensithios  decree, \u00b7      \u00b5   (SEG 27  631  (C 6l)).  Scholarly  opinion remains  divided  as  to  whether  (i)  the  Dataleis  and  the  polis should  be  identified;  (ii)  the  Dataleis  represent  a  sub-unit  of the  polis,  in  which  case  the  name  of  the  polis  is  not  known;  or (iii)  the  Dataleis  represent  an  altogether  distinct  communi- ty  from  the  unnamed  polis  (Viviers  ( 1994)).  The  first alter- native,  viz.  the  polis  is  Datala,  is  adopted  here.  The  term  is used  in  its  political  sense  both  in  the  enactment  formula quoted  above  and  in  the  phrase  \u00b5\u00b5 .  Independent  of  the  Spensithios  decree, the  identification of  Datala  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  is supported  by  the  individual  use  of  the  ethnic  in  the  artist's signature  \u00b5   '  (Prakt  ( 1973)  191 (C 6);  Perlman  ( 1996)  246\u00ad52).  The  collective use  occurs  in the  Spensithios  decree  (SEG 27  631  (C 6l)). During  the  Archaic  period  Datala  perhaps  shared  a  bor- der  with  Lyktos  (SEG 35  991B4  (C 6);  van  Effenterre  and  van Effenterre  ( 1985)  182\u00ad83).  The  polis  of  Datala  disappears from  the  record  following  C 6.  It  seems  likely  that  the  com- munity  was  absorbed  by  a  more  powerful  neighbour (Viviers  ( 1994)).  In  C 2  the  topoynm  was  apparently  still  in use  to  designate  an  area  at  the  border  of  Lato  and  Lyktos, [  ]   [  ] (I.Cret.i.xvi.5,l.64;  van  Effenterre ( 1973)  35\u00ad37).Perhaps  was  the  name  of  the  ter- ritory  of  the  polis  during  the  Archaic  period. The  Spensithios  decree  (SEG 27  631  (C 6l))  provides  a good  deal  of  information  about  the  public  institutions  of Datala,  but  each  detail  has  proved  to  be  controversial  (for  a review  of  the  scholarly  interpretations  of  this  text,  see Nomima i22).  The  enactment  formula  of  the  decree  (      \u00b5   ...    '   ) indicates that the assembly,  identified b y both  the  collective city-ethnic  and  the  term ,  perhaps  together  with  a  council  consisting  of  five individuals  from  each  of  the  phylai  (      ' ),  were  responsible  for  ratifying  the  public  enact- ments  of  the  community.  The  \u00b5  was  apparently  the chief  official at Datala.  He  (or  they,  if  the  singular  \u00b5  is here  used  for  a  board)  enjoyed  unspecified procedural rights  at  law  ( ),which henceforth the   was to  share.  The  served  as  \"recorder\"  and \"remembrancer\"  for  the  polis,    \u00b5\u00b5,  and  was  responsible  for  performing \u00b5 \u00b5if  there  was  no  priest.  The  authority  of  the polis  was  clearly  recognised  in  several  areas.  Affairs  of  state,  \u00b5,  included  both  sacred  and  secular  matters.  The polis  was  authorised  to  award  individuals  ,  and  so, presumably,  could  impose  and  collect  taxes,  and  judicial immunity  ( ),and  was  able  to  guarantee  protection against  bodily  seizure  ( \u00b5'   ... \u00b5 '). Finally,  the  citizens  (presumably)  of  Datala  belonged  to ,  to  which  they  were  required  to  contribute  food. If  the  identification of  Datala  with  the  settlement  at Aphrati  (Prophitis  Ilias)  is  correct,  more  may  be  said  about the  organisation  of  the  polis.  At  the  summit  of  the  acropolis, fortifications w ith  towers  enclosed  a  small  area,  roughly trapezoidal  in  shape,  supplied  with  water  from  a  cistern (Levi  ( 1927\u00ad29)  32\u00ad37).  Excavations  conducted  by  the  Greek Archaeological  Service  (A.  Lebessi)  in  1968  and 1969  uncov- ered  on  the  south-eastern  slope  of  the  acropolis  what  was  in C 7  a  large  one-room  building  ( 12  m 6.8  m)  with  benches along  its  interior  walls.  A  scatter  of  C 6  material  attests  the continued  use  of  the  area  in  the  Archaic  period.  The  build- ing  is  probably  to  be  identified as a t emple  (ArchDelt 24 ( 1969)  Chron. 415\u00ad18;  ArchDelt 25  ( 1970)  Chron. 455\u00ad60;  cf. Viviers  ( 1994)  244\u00ad49:  andreion or bouleuterion). Residential  districts  were  situated  on  the  protected  eastern slopes  of  the  acropolis  (Levi  ( 1927\u00ad29)  38\u00ad57),where  Lebessi uncovered  a  building  complex  (domestic?)  of  C 6\u00adC5  with  a closed  deposit  of  c. 425\u00ad400  (ArchDelt 25  ( 1970)  Chron. 458\u00ad60).  Geometric  and  Orientalising  cemeteries  were located  on  the  upper  western  slopes  of  Prophitis  Ilias  (Levi ( 1927\u00ad29)  78\u00ad400;  for  a  sarcophagus  of  C 6  from  \"Orthi Petres\",  see  ArchDelt 30  ( 1975)  Chron. 341\u00ad42).  The  settle- ment  may  have been  abandoned  for  much of  C 4  (Erickson ( 2000)  361\u00ad62).  A  magistral  dedication  from  Aphrati  indi- cates  that  the  \u00b5  served  as  the  eponymous  officials for the  community  (I.Cret. i.v.4  (C 5)).  The  dedication  is  to Athena,  and  the  inference  may  be  drawn  that  the  goddess enjoyed  a  state  cult  there. The  alternative  candidate  for  the  site  of  Datala,  Pinakiano (Ag.  Giorgios  Papoura),  is  located  to  the  north  of  Lasithi  on a  ridge  70  m  above  the  plain  (Watrous  ( 1982)  39\u00ad40). 1156 perlman Evidence  for  habitation  dates  from  the  Protogeometric through  the  Archaic  period,  when  it  was  the  largest  settle- ment  in  this  area.  Remains  of  C 5  and  C 4  (votive  terracotta plaques  and  black  glazed  pottery)  are  concentrated  on  the south-east  slope  of  the  ridge  and  perhaps  attest  a  shrine which  survived  the  abandonment  of  the  settlement. 955.

The  earliest  attestation  of  Malla  as  a  polis  in  the  political sense  occurs  in  the  agreement  between  Malla  and  Lyktos, which  provides  that  fines are t o  be  paid     (I.Cret. i.xix.1  (C 3m)).There  is  no  doubt  that  Malla  was  a  polis  in  the political  sense  during  the  Hellenistic  period.  Moreover, although  the  polis  town  of  Malla  has  not  been  identified with  certainty,  it  seems  likely  that  it  was  located  in  the  vicin- ity  of  modern  Malles  on  the  eastern  slopes  of  Mt.  Dikte, either  \"under  the  now  deserted  lower  village  ...around  the church  of  Ay.  Georgios\"  (Sanders  ( 1982)  138  ( 2/2))  or between  the  villages  of  Malles  and  Christos,  close  to  the spring  of  Ag.

Malla  was  thus an  inland  and  upland  settlement,  and  such  settlements  were for  the  most  part  established  well  before  the  end  of  C 5.For these  reasons,  Malla  is  included  in  the  Inventory  as  a  possi- ble  polis  (type  C). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  the  agreement  between  Malla  and  Lyktos  (I.Cret. i.xix.1.6 (C 3m))  and  externally  in  the  renewal  of  asylia  for  Teos (I.Cret. i.xix.2.1  (C 2f)).  For  the  individual  use  of  the  city- ethnic  there  is  the  honorand  of  Tenos,  (IG xii  suppl. 304  (C 3m)). Although  the  phylai  are  attested  only  in  Hellenistic sources,  they  are  likely  to  be  early  and  so  are  mentioned  here. The  tribal  name  is  preserved  in  the  dating  formu- la  of  a  public  enactment  (I.Cret. i.xix.3A  (c. 183)).  Hellenistic inscriptions  refer  to  the  prytaneion  (I.Cret. i.xix.3A38 (c. 183))  and  the  agora  (I.Cret. i.xix.3A  50\u00ad51  (c. 183)).In  so  far as  both  are  attested  elsewhere  on  Crete  during  the  Archaic and  Classical  periods  (prytaneion:  see  Lato,  supra;agora:see Gortyn,  supra;  Phaistos,  infra),  it  is  possible  that  also  at Malla  they  are  pre-Hellenistic. The  protecting  deity  of  Malla  was  perhaps  Zeus Monnitios  (public  enactments  displayed  in  his  sanctuary (I.Cret. i.xix.2  (C 2m));  coin  types,  infra).

Ps.-Skylax 47  provides  the  earliest  reference  to Phalasarna as  a  polis,  in  this  case  in  the  urban  sense.  The  earliest  refer- ence  to  Phalasarna  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  occurs  in the  agreement  of  Miletos        (Milet. i.3140.1,  39  (c. 259\u00ad250)).  The  Stadiasmus  describes Phalasarna  as  a     ( 336). Phalasarna  was  clearly  a  polis  in  the  early  Hellenistic  peri- od.  Ps.-Skylax's  attestation  of  polis  status  in  the  urban  sense is  confirmed b y  the  Archaic  and  Classical  remains  of  the town  (especially  the  temples  and  fortifications,  infra),  and that  Phalarsarna  was  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  as  well  can be  inferred  from  her  mint,  which  may  have  commenced  as early  as  c. 330  (infra). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  a  dedication  of    (I.Cret. ii.xix.2 (C 3s)),  and  externally  in  an  enactment  formula  of  the alliance  between  Phalasarna  and  Polyrhen  (I.Cret. ii.xi.1 (C 3e);  Markoulaki  ( 2000)).  For  the  individual  use  of  the city-ethnic  there  is  the  proxenos  of  Epidauros  and  theo- rodokos  of  Apollo  and  Asklepios   ' (IG iv\u00b2.196.12\u00ad13  and  SB 1368  (C 3m)). The  territory  of  Phalasarna, (Markoulaki  ( 2000)  l. 21  (C 3e)),  included  the  Grambousa peninsula  and  the  coastal  plain  known  today  as  Livadhia. The  polis  shared  a  border  with  Polyrhen,  with  whom  she fought  in  C 4l  or  C 3e.  Copies  of  the  C 3e  treaty  of  peace  and alliance  that  concluded  these  hostilities  were  found  at  the sanctuary  of  Diktynna  on  the  Rhodopou  peninsula  (I.Cret. ii.xi.1)  and  at  a  sanctuary  at  near  Kaliviani (Markoulaki  ( 2000));  the  latter  was  perhaps  located  on  the frontier  between  Phalasarna  and  Polyrhen. The  polis  town  of  Phalasarna  was  located  on  Cape  Koutri ( 90  m)  and  in  the  plain  to  its  east.  The  total  area  occupied  by the  polis  town  is  estimated  to  have  been  c. 60  ha  (E.  Hadjidaki ( 1992)).  The  east  and  north  flanks of  the  acropolis  were  for- tified,  C 5\u00adC4  (Gondiccas  ( 1988)  86\u00ad92;  E.  Hadjidaki  ( 1992), ( 1996)).  Public  buildings,  including  at  least  two  temples, were  located  on  the  summit  of  the  acropolis  (Gondiccas ( 1988)  86\u00ad92;  E.  Hadjidaki  ( 1992),  ( 1996)).  One  of  the  two temples  probably  belonged  to  the  protecting  deity  of  the polis,  Artemis  Diktynna  (Dion.  Calliphon.,  GGM i  119\u00ad22). Cisterns  and  house  platforms  cut  into  the  rock  on  the  slopes of  the  acropolis  indicate  the  location  of  residential  areas (Gondiccas  ( 1988)  86\u00ad92;  E.  Hadjidaki  ( 1992)).  The  fortifi- cations  of  the  closed  harbour,  a  \u00b5   (Ps.-Skylax 47;  Dion.  Calliphon.,  GGM i  118\u00ad21),  located  at  the  foot  of the  acropolis  to  the  south-east,  date  to  C 4s  (Frost  and Hadjidaki  ( 1990);  E.  Hadjidaki  ( 1992),  ( 1996)).  An  industri- al  area  of  the  late  Hellenistic  period  has  been  identified near the  north-west  corner  of  the  harbour  (E.  Hadjidaki  ( 1996)). The  cemetery  with  pithos  burials  of  C 6e\u00adC5m  and Hellenistic  cist  graves  has  been  partially  excavated  to  the south-east  of  the  harbour  (Gondiccas  ( 1988)  97\u00ad116). Quarries  were  located  along  the  shore  to  the  south  of  the cemetery  (Gondiccas  ( 1988)  95).  Three  rock-cut  \"thrones\" (C 5\u00adC3e)  located  near  the  cemetery  and  the  quarries  may  be Phoenician  (or  Punic);  if  so,  they  attest  the  participation  of Phalasarna  in  the  east\u00adwest  trade  of  Phoenician  mariners (Di  Vita  ( 1992\u00ad93)). Phalasarna  struck  coins  (staters)  on  the  Aiginetan  stan- dard  during  the  period  c. 330\u00ad280/270  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  190, 198;  IGCH  no. 109).

There  is  no  further evidence  for  Apollonia  as  an  early  name  of  Eleutherna. ,  and may  all  derive  ultimately  from the  toponym  preserved  in  Apollo's  cult  title   (SEG 41  743  (C 3e);  van  Effenterre  ( 1991b)  28).

The  earliest  evidence  for  - - is the legend   on the  C 4m  coins  (infra).  Later  inscriptions  and  coins  from Eleutherna  suggest  no  pattern  in  the  use  of  the  assimilated versus  unassimilated  form  of  the  group  - - (cf.  Bile  ( 1988) 121\u00ad22,  which  appeared  before  the  publication  of  SEG 41 739\u00ad55). The  earliest  attestations  of  the  term  in  connection with  Eleutherna  occur  in  uncertain  contexts  in  two  Archaic laws  (I.Cret. ii.xii.14a,  with  \u00b5  in  the  following  line; I.Cret. ii.xii.16Ab  (both  C 6l)),  but  the  earliest  certain  refer- 1158 perlman ence  to Eleutherna  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  occurs  in the  agreement  of  Miletos        (Milet. i.3140.1,  38  (c. 259\u00ad250)),  in  which  the  Eleuthernaioi are  included  as  one  of  the       .  The  term is  paired  with  \u00b5  in  I.Cret. ii.xii.16Ab, \u00b5   \u00b5 \u00b5[  ] '    ,\"neither in the apamia  nor  in  the polis\".  The  term \u00b5  seems  to  refer  to  land  in  the  chora, in  which  case  here  is  used  in  the  urban  sense  (Nomima i26;  cf.  Chaniotis  ( 1996)  19\u00ad20:  private  land  cultivated  by serfs).  For  polis  in  the  urban  sense,  see  also  Ps.-Skylax  47, where  Eleuthernai  is  listed  under  the  heading      . The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  the  coins  of  C 4m\u00adC3f(infra),  and  externally  in  the agreement  of  Miletos  (Milet 1.3140.1,  38  (c. 259\u00ad250)).  For  the  individual  use  of the  city-ethnic,  there  is  the  proxeny  decree  of  Gortyn  for  '  (I.Cret. iv  206F (C 3/C2)). An  Archaic  law  regulating  the  consumption  of  wine  men- tions  symposiastic  consumption  on     (SEG 41 739  (C 6l)).  The  toponym  refers  to  a  cape  on  the  north  coast of  Crete  between  Pantomatrion  and  Heraklion  (Ptol.  Geog. 3.15.5  (from  west  to  east):  Cape  Lianos,  Chondros,  Korakias or  Bali)  which  perhaps  marked  the  eastern  border  of Eleutherna  with  Axos  (van  Effenterre  ( 1991c)  18\u00ad20). Wherever  its  exact  location,  this  inscription  indicates  that the  territory  of  the  Archaic  polis  extended  to  the  north  coast. The  inland  asty  is  likely  to  have  been  served  by  one  or  more harbours  on  the  north  coast.  A  coastal  settlement  (Archaic and  later)  has  been  identified at Stavromenos, 11  km  east  of Rhethymnon  (S.  Hood  et al.( 1964)  62\u00ad66;  Schiering  ( 1982) 17\u00ad47).  Coins  with  the  legend  (rev.)  found  (in  some quantity?)  there  suggest  that  this  might  be  ancient \u00b5 (Faure  ( 1993)  72).  The  relatively  large  num- ber  of  coins  of  Eleutherna  found  there  indicate  that  it  was frequented  by  Eleuthernians,  and  that  it  perhaps  served  as  a port  for  the  polis  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  252\u00ad54).  Whether  the  set- tlement  at  Stavromenos  was  part  of  the  polis  of  Eleutherna during  the  Archaic  period  cannot  be  determined.  The of  the  Artemitai  (I.Cret. ii.xii.22  (C 3l))  may  repre- sent  either  a  territorial  civic  subdivision  of  Eleutherna (Perlman  ( 1996)  252\u00ad54)  or  a  dependent  community  of Eleutherna  (Chaniotis  ( 1996)  402\u00ad6:  non-citizens,  possibly freedmen,  settled  near  a  sanctuary  of  Artemis). The  term  \u00b5,  perhaps  referring  to citizens  of  the younger  age-grades  who  enjoyed  limited  citizen  rights, appears  in  the  Archaic  law  concerning  the  consumption  of  wine  (SEG 41  740;  Tzifopoulos  ( 1998)  150\u00ad69).  The  compound ,  partially  restored  in  an  Archaic law  (I.Cret. ii.xii.3  (C 6l)),  has  been  understood  to  refer  to resident  aliens  (Guarducci  ( 1939)  148)  or  to expatriates  of Eleutherna  (van  Effenterre  and  van  Effenterre  ( 1985)  187\u00ad88; Nomima i10).  The  partly  preserved  [---]  ~ [---] (I.Cret. ii.xii.4)  most  likely  refers  to foreigners  or  to officials or  laws  pertaining  to foreigners.  This  same  text  may  preserve a  reference  to \u00b5  or \u00b5  (vel  sim.)  in  line  1  ([---] \u00b5 [\u00b5] .[---] or [---] \u00b5   [ \u00b5].[---]).  The  term \u00b5  (I.Cret. ii.xii.16Ab,  l. 2),  a  category  of  land  holding, implies  that  the  community  of  Eleutherna  identified c ertain of  its  members  as  \u00b5,  a  term  attested  in  literary sources  (largely  lexicographical),  where  it  is  defined as a Cretan  term for  an  individual  of  dependent  status (Athenaeus  VI  263f;  Hsch.  s.v.;  Strabo  15.1.34). The  kosmate  is  attested  in  what  is  perhaps  a  reference  to the  eponymous  kosmoi  of  the  current  or  of  a  previous  year (I.Cret. ii.xii.9,l.  3):  [---  ] \u00b5   \u00b5  \"[in  the year  when  ] and Timarchos were kosmoi\").  From this  we  may  deduce  that  the  kosmate  was  eponymous  and was  organised  as  a  board  (for  the  kosmate,  see  also  I.Cret. ii.xii.14  (C 6l);  I.Cret. ii.xii.20\u00ad22  (C 3)).  The  Archaic  laws preserve  the  terms  \u00b5~  \"to  bring  an  action\"  (I.Cret. ii.xii.15a  b), \"adjudicate\"  (I.Cret. ii.xii.11),  and [ ] \"record (in writing)\"  (ibid.).  Two  of  the laws  refer  to  witnesses  or  to  the  act  of  testifying:  [--- \u00b5] [---] (I.Cret.  ii.xii.8);  [---  \u00b5]\u00b5  or  [--- \u00b5] \u00b5   (I.Cret. ii.xii.13).  Others  refer  to  oaths:  the act  of  taking  an  oath  (  \u00b5,I.Cret.  ii.xii.3),denial by  oath  ( &lt;&gt;\u00b5,  SEG 23  571; \u00b5[---]?,  I.Cret. ii.xii.17),  and  perhaps  to  the  oath  curse  ([---  ~    ]       \u00b5[],\"the curse shall be included in the oath\", I.Cret. ii.xii.3).  Two  of  the  laws  guarantee  immunity  from prosecution: /     \u00b5  (I.Cret. ii.xii.3,  11). The  only  early  documentary  evidence  for  the  foreign  rela- tions  of  Eleutherna  is  the  reference  to a  in  an  Archaic law  (I.Cret. ii.xii.11  (C 6l),  with  Nomima i14).All  other  evid- ence  for  the  foreign  relations  of  Eleutherna  dates  to the Hellenistic  period.  The  presence  of  pottery  from  Corinth (C 7s\u00adC6f),  Lakonia  and  Argos  (C 6),  Attika  (from  C 6l), Gortyn  (C 7\u00adC4),  Knosos  (C 6\u00adC5),  and  possibly  Kydonia and  Aphrati  (C 6)  attests  to  Eleutherna's  participation  in intra-island  and  Mediterranean  trading  networks,  but  is  not sufficient t o  demonstrate  direct  relations  with  any  one  of these  places  (Erickson  ( 2000)  237\u00ad56). Zeus  Polioachos  was  worshipped  by  the  polis  (SEG 41  744 (C 2s);  coins,  infra),  but  it  is  not  clear  that  Zeus  was  the  crete  1159 protecting  deity  of  Eleutherna  (for  the  cults  of  Eleutherna, see  Stavrianopoulou  ( 1991),  with  Chaniotis  ( 1996)  190\u00ad95). The  polis  town  of  ancient  Eleutherna  was  built  on  two neighbouring  ridges:  Pyrgi  to  the  east  (perhaps  called Sasthra  in  Antiquity:  van  Effenterre  ( 1991b)  28)  and  Nisi  to the  west  (perhaps  called  Wilkon  in  Antiquity:  ibid. 28\u00ad30). Pyrgi  appears  to  have  been  the  centre  of  the  early  settlement. Remains  there  include  the  Geometric\u00adClassical  cemetery  at the  western  foot  of  Pyrgi  and  two  (or  perhaps  three)  sanctu- aries.  Another  sanctuary  was  located  on  southern  Nisi. During  the  Classical  period  a  large  peribolos  ( 35  m 50  m) with  a  Doric  pentastyle  propylon  was  built  on  Nisi  in  the location  of  the  earlier  sanctuary.  Its  function  remains  uncer- tain.  Van  Effenterre  identifies the peribolos  as  the  sanctuary of  Apollo  Wilkonios  and  the  meeting  place  of  the  Cretan koinon  (van  Effenterre  ( 1991b)  28\u00ad30).  Fortifications of uncertain  date  are  identified on N isi  to  the  north  of  the Classical  peribolos  and  enclosing  a  Hellenistic  residential district further  to the  north,  and  on  the  summit  of  Pyrgi  to the  south  of  Hellenistic  buildings.  A  terminus  ante  quem  for the  fortifications of 221/0  is  provided  by Polyb. 4.55.4.For an overview  of  the  settlement  history  of  the  polis  town of Eleutherna,  see  Kalpaxis  ( 1994)  with  plan  1;  for  the Geometric\u00adClassical  cemetery,  see  Stampolidis  ( 1993); Erickson  ( 2000)  156\u00ad228;  for  plans  of  the  Classical  peribolos on  Nisi  and  the  Hellenistic  buildings  on  Pyrgi  which  show the  provenance  of  SEG 41  739\u00ad55,  see  Kalpaxis  ( 1991);  for  the Hellenistic  residential  district  on  northern  Nisi,  see  Kalpaxis et al.( 1994). The  term  \"stater\"  occurs  in  two  inscriptions  of  C 6l  (SEG 2 12.13,23  571).If  the  term  refers  to  coinage  rather  than  to  a  unit of  weight,  these  inscriptions  provide  some  of  the  earliest  evi- dence  for  the  use  of  coins  on  Crete.  If  so,  the  term  most  like- ly  refers  to Aiginetan  staters.  Eleutherna's  proximity  to Kydonia,  whence  Aiginetan  coinage  is  likely  to  have  been introduced  into  the  island  during  the  final quarter of  C 6 (Stefanakis  ( 1999)),  makes  this  an  attractive  possibility. Eleutherna  began  to  strike  her  own  coins  (staters)  on  the Aiginetan  standard  c. 350  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  197).  Types:  obv. Apollo  holding  a  stone  and  a  bow,  with  a  dog  and  flanked b y two  trees  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  130,  styrax  trees?);  rev.  Artemis the  huntress;  legend: written  retrograde  in  the epichoric  alphabet  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pl.  XI. 4).  Later  coins (staters,  drachms,  hemidrachms,  c. 330\u00ad280/270)  have  obv.  head  of  Apollo  or  head  of  Zeus;  rev.Apollo  standing;  leg- end: or and abbreviations  down to ,  some  retrograde  (Svoronos ( 1890)  pls.  XI. 5\u00ad6,  9\u00ad11,  14\u00ad17,  22,  24,  27\u00ad39;  XII. 1\u00ad2,  with  Le Rider  ( 1966)  197;  SNG Cop.  Aeg.Isl. 429).  Obols  of  this  period have  obv.  head  of  Apollo;  rev.  Apollo  standing  or  E  or  E ^  in monogram  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pl.  XI. 12\u00ad13,  18\u00ad20,  25). 958.  *Eltynia  (Eltynieus) Map  60.  Lat. 35.15,long.  25.10. Size of  territory: 2.

In  the  Hellenistic  period  the  form '  occurs  in  inscriptions  from  sites  outside  the island  (SB 5273  (C 3f);  I.Magnesia 21  (C 2e)). The  earliest  reference  to  Eltynia  as  a  polis  in  the  political sense  occurs  in  a  law  concerning  damages  for  personal injury  which  requires  that  fines be paid     (I.Cret. i.x.2  (C 5e)). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  the  law  concerning  personal  injury  (I.Cret. i.x.2  (C 5e)), and  externally  in  the  agreement  of  Miletos           (Milet. i.3140.36  (c. 259\u00ad250)).  For  the  indi- vidual  use  of  the  city-ethnic,  there  is  the  proxeny  decree  of Gortyn  for    '  (I.Cret. iv 206G  (C 3/C2)). The  chief  public  official of  Eltynia  appears  to  have  been the \u00b5  (or  board  of \u00b5),  who  served  both  execu- tive (       \u00b5,  \"exact  the  fine for the polis\")  and  judicial  ( []   \u00b5,\"decide having sworn  the  oath\")  functions  (I.Cret. i.x.2  (C 5e)).  The  board perhaps  consisted  of  just  two  members  ( \u00b5  ... , I.Cret. i.x.2,l.  3,  with  Bile  ( 1997)  116).  Line  2  of  this  same  text probably  preserves  part  of  an  enactment  formula:  [ \u00b7 '   ]   '.If  so,  '  in this  context  refers  to the  assembly.  The  terms  and occur  in  the  law  concerning  bodily  injury  (I.Cret. ii.x.2  (C 5e))  and  refer  to  age-grades  (\"child\"  and  \"youth\" respectively)  of  the  citizen  class  of  the  polis. Almost  nothing  is  known  archaeologically  about  Eltynia apart  from  the  chance  discovery  of  the  membra  disiecta (capital  and  wall  blocks  including  the  one  bearing  I.Cret. i.x.2)  of  an  Archaic?  Doric  temple  (Xanthoudides  ( 1920) 75\u00ad81).  Four  terms,  probably  referring  to public  areas  in  the polis  town,  occur  in  a  provision  of  the  law  concerning  per- sonal  injury,  which  details  where  the  injury  takes  place  (ibid. ll. 6\u00ad7  (C 5e)):  (i)  ;  (ii) ;  (iii) , place  where  contracts  are  made  (Bile  ( 1988)  179)  or  \"combat zone\"  or  refectory (Nomima ii  80);  (iv)  ,  agora  (Bile ( 1988)  344  n. 84)  or  dance  floor ( Nomima ii  80).

Although  Tarrha  is  called  a  polis  in  late  sources  only (Paus. 10.16.5;  Steph.  Byz. 604.6\u00ad8),  it  clearly  was  a  polis  in the  political  sense  during  the  Hellenistic  period,  and  there  is little  doubt  that  the  same  was  true  during  the  Classical  peri- od  and  perhaps  even  the  Archaic.  The  evidence  for  this, which  includes  (i)  participation  in  the  C 4l\u00adC3  federation   (van  Effenterre  ( 1948a)  119\u00ad27;  Chaniotis  ( 1996) 106\u00ad8,  421\u00ad22;  cf.  Sekunda  ( 2000)  337\u00ad38:  league  founded C 3f),  (ii)  striking  coins  as  early  as  c. 330  (infra),  and  (iii)  the individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  (Perlman  ( 1996)  246\u00ad52), recommends  its  inclusion  in  the  Inventory  as  a  probable polis  (type  B). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  in abbreviated  form  on  coins  (infra),  and  externally  in  the alliance  of  the  members  of  the  Cretan  koinon  with  Eumenes  II (I.Cret. iv  179.8  (c. 183)).For  the  individual  use  there  is  the  ded- ication  of    [ ] from the sanctuary of  Orthia in  Sparta  (IG v.1252  (C 6);  but  cf.  BSA 12  ( 1906)  353.1).  Tarrha was  a  member  of  the  C 4l\u00adC3  federation     (supra). The  hillside  west  of  upper  Ag.  Roumeli  at  the  mouth  of the  river  Tarrhaios  and  the  Samaria  Gorge  was  the  site  of  the main  Classical\u00adHellenistic  settlement  of  Tarrha  (Nixon  et al.( 1990)  217).The  location  afforded  Tarrha  little  arable  land (Rackham  ( 1990)  108\u00ad9),  and  it  is  likely  that  her  inhabitants relied  for  their  livelihood  upon  the  mountains  and  the  sea (for  the  economic  exploitation  of  Crete's  mountains,  see Chaniotis  ( 1999);  for  bee-keeping  and  shepherding  at Tarrha,  see  the  coin  types,  infra;  for  cedar  forests  in  the mountains  around  Tarrha,  see  Theophr.  Hist.  pl. ii.ii.2;for their  exploitation,  Perlman  ( 1999)  146).  The  Church of  the Panaghia  west  of  the  river  is  very  likely  the  site  of  a  temple, perhaps  that  of  Apollo,  who  was  probably  the  protecting deity  of  the  polis  (Guarducci  ( 1939)  305\u00ad6;  Weinberg ( 1960)).  Archaic  (and  earlier?)  and  Classical  burials  have been  found  to  the  west  of  the  river  near  the  modern  village (Tzedakis  ( 1971)).  On  the  coast  to  the  east  of  the  river  are  the remains  of  a  cemetery  (C 5l  and  later)  and  of  a  Roman  sea- wall  (Nixon  et al.( 1990)  218).

This  may  reflect either the assimila- tion  of  Anopolis  by  Araden,  both  of  which  are  included  in the  list  of  theorodokoi  from  Delphi  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  1\u00ad85, iii.108\u00ad10  (c. 230\u00ad210)),  or  some  confusion  due  to the  prox- imity  of  the  two  communities  (Guarducci  ( 1939)  6;  cf. Perlman  ( 1995b)  135\u00ad36).  Anopolis  surely  was  a  polis  during the  period  C 3s\u00adC2--as is attested b y  the  Delphic  theo- rodokos  (supra),  by the  proxeny  decree  from  Lappa  (supra) and  by  its  C 3  bronze  coins  (infra)--and this fact t ogether with  the  material  remains  from  the  Classical  period  suggests that  Anopolis  was  possibly  a  polis  (type  C)  in  the  Classical period  as  well. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally in  a  C 2e  alliance  (I.Cret. iv  179).  For  the  individual  use  there is  an  unpublished  proxeny  decree  of  C 2  from  Lappa  for  an and  the  grave  stele  of \u00b5 \u00b5    from  Eretria  (IG xii.9819  (C 1)). The  polis  town  of  Anopolis  was  located  on  the  summit and  northern  slopes  of  the  coastal  ridge  north  of  Loutro (ancient  Phoenix,  the  only  winter  harbour  on  Crete's  south coast).  The  polis  town  was  defended  by  a  fortification  wall with  towers  which  may  be  no  earlier  than  C 3l(Nixon  et  al. ( 1989)  207).  Parts  of  columns  have  been  found  on  the  ridge, but  their  date  is  uncertain  (ibid. 208).  Remains  on  the Anopolis  plain  to  the  north  of  the  ridge  represent  isolated farms  and  small  hamlets  of  several  houses.  Precise  dates  for these  are  not  given,  but  in  general  the  Classical  and Hellenistic  periods  are  better  represented  at  Anopolis  than  is the  Archaic  period  (ibid.).  The  western  border  of  Anopolis (with  Araden)  probably  followed  the  Araden  gorge. Anopolis  struck  bronze  fractions  after  c. 250  (Guarducci ( 1939)  7;  Svoronos  ( 1890)  5\u00ad6). 946. ", "Hyrtakina": "Identifier: 965. , (Hyrtakinios) Map  60.  Lat. 35.15,long. 23.45.

On  current  evidence  the  principal  phas- es  of  occupation  date  to  the  Classical  and  Hellenistic  peri- ods.  Early  explorers  describe  two  sectors  of  the  city  in  some detail:  (i)  along  the  southern  sector  of  the  fortification wall, where  there  is  a  gate  with  a  road  which  can  be  traced  from the  south  (perhaps  from  Lisos,  Niniou-Kindeli  ( 1990))  lead- ing  into  the  city;  and  (ii)  inside  the  city  to  the  west  near  the fortification wall,  where  there  is  a  large  building  and  a  pub- lic?  cistern  (Savignoni  and  de  Sanctis  ( 1901)  408\u00ad24).  An open-air  sanctuary  of  Pan  (C 4\u00adC3)  was  located  at  the  east- ern  edge  of  the  acropolis  (Theophanides  ( 1942\u00ad44b)).  The late  Classical  or  Hellenistic  circuit  wall  is  built  of  polygonal masonry  (Savignoni  and  de  Sanctis  ( 1901)  408\u00ad24).  Tombs (C 5\u00adC4)  are  numerous  on  the  southern  and  northern  slopes of  the  acropolis  and  on  the  hill  Ag.  Ioannis  to  the  east.  The existence  of  a  prytaneion  called  the  may  be inferred  from  the  offer  of                (I.Cret. ii.xv.2  (C 2m)).  If  so,  in  so  far  as  the prytaneion  is  attested  elsewhere  on  Crete  during  the Classical  period  (see  Lato  (no. 971)),  it  is  possible  that  also  at Hyrtakina  it  was  pre-Hellenistic.

The  surface  remains  are  Archaic and  later  (Hayden  et al.( 1992)  298,  330\u00ad32,  343/NP1;  cf.  Barr. H  and  later).  This  and  the  fact  that  there  is  no  doubt  that Istron  was  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  during  the  Hellenistic period  recommend  its  inclusion  in  the  Inventory  as  a  possi- ble  polis  (type  C). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally in  the  agreement  between  Knosos  and  Miletos  (Milet. i.3 140.38  (c. 259\u00ad250))  and  in  an  asylia  decree  for  Teos  (I.Cret. i.xiv.1  (C 3l)).  For  the  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  there is  the  proxeny?  decree  for  '  (IG xii.5  suppl. 304  (C 3m)). The  largest  buildings  on  Nisi  Pandeleimon  are  on  the south-eastern  knob  of  the  promontory  and  on  its  southern slopes.  A  stretch  of  circuit  wall  (c. 1.5  m  thick)  is  preserved just  above  sea  level  on  the  north-western  side  of  the promontory  (Hayden  et al.( 1992)  330\u00ad32,  343/NP1).  In treaties  of  C 2l  the  eastern  border  of  Lato  seems  to encom- pass  the  territory  of  ancient  Istron,  suggesting  that  by  then the  polis  had  been  absorbed  by  Lato  (Faure  ( 1967)  111;van Effenterre  and  Bougrat  ( 1969)  38;Hayden et al.( 1992)  299 with  fig. 3). The  protecting  deity  of  Istron  was  Athene  Polias,  in  whose sanctuary  the  public  enactments  of  the  polis  were  displayed (I.Cret. i.xiv.1  (C 3l)). 965.

But  there  is no  question  that  Keraia  was  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  dur- ing  the  Hellenistic  period  (Polyb. 4.55.2;  I.Magnesia 21  (C 2e); I.Cret. iv  179  (c. 183)).  Keraia  is  included  in  the  Inventory  as  a probable  polis  (type  B)  on  the  strength  of  its  mint,  which may  have  begun  production  as  early  as  c. 330  (infra). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  the  coins  (infra),  and  externally  in  the  alliance  of  Keraia and  the  members  of  the  Cretan  koinon  with  Eumenes  II (I.Cret. iv  179  (c. 183)).

In  Ps.-Skylax 47,  where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense, Rhaukos  is  one  of  the  toponyms  listed  under  the  heading      .  The  earliest  explicit  reference  to Rhaukos  as  a  polis,  and  here  in  the  political  sense,  occurs  in the  agreement  of  Miletos        (Milet. i.3140.1,  36  (c. 259\u00ad250)).  Rhaukos  was  certainly  a polis  in  the  political  sense  during  the  early  Hellenistic  peri- od.  The  coins,  which  perhaps  began  as  early  as  c. 330  (infra), suggest  that  this  was  already  the  case  in  the  late  Classical period. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  occurs  internally  on the  C 4s\u00adC3f  coins  (infra),  and  externally  in  the  agreement  of Miletos           (Milet. i.3140.36 (c. 259\u00ad250)).  For  the  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic,  there are  the  proxenoi  of  Iasos,    `  (I.Iasos 53  (C 4l/C3e)),  and  of  Gortyn, \u00b5  `  (I.Cret. iv  206  (C 3/C2)). The  polis  town  of  Rhaukos  (modern  Ag.  Myronas)  is almost  unknown  archaeologically  (Pendlebury  et al. ( 1932\u00ad33)  91\u00ad92;  Sanders  ( 1982)  154  ( 9/12)),  but  a  Hellenistic inscription  recording  the  border  of  Gortyn  and  Knosos most  likely  refers  to the  agora  of  Rhaukos  and  to the  pry- taneion  in  the  agora  (I.Cret. iv  182.3\u00ad4  (c. 167/6);  Chaniotis ( 1996)  296\u00ad300).  In  so  far  as  both  terms  are  attested  else- where  on  Crete  during  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods (agora:  see  Gortyn  (no. 960)  and  Phaistos  (no. 980);  pry- taneion:  see  Lato  (no. 971),  it  is  possible  that  also  at  Rhaukos the  agora  and  the  prytaneion  are  pre-Hellenistic. Rhaukos  struck  coins  (staters,  drachms,  hemidrachms) on  the  Aiginetan  standard  during  the  period  c. 330\u00ad280/270 (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  197;  IGCH  no. 109).  Staters  have  obv.

Stephanos  records  three  earlier  names:  , crete  1165  ,   \u00b5  (Steph.  Byz. 328.4\u00ad5).  For \u00b5,cf.the tribal name \u00b5  infra.  The  city-ethnic is `  (I.Cret. iii.iii.1A  (C 3s),  iv. 3  (C 3e)). Probably  the  earliest  ancient  sources  to  call  Hierapytna  a polis  in  the  political  sense  are  the  decree  of  isopoliteia  with Arkades  (I.Cret. iii.iii.1B  10  (C 3l))  and  the  alliance  between Hierapytna  and  Rhodos  (I.Cret. iii.iii.3A  (C 3l)).  Hierapytna is  included  in  the  Inventory  as  a  probable  polis  (type  B) largely  on  the  strength  of  its  mint,  which  began  to  strike coins  in  C 4f(infra). The  collective  and  internal  use  of  the  city-ethnic  occurs in  the  alliance  with  Antigonos  Doson  (I.Cret. iii.iii.1A  (C 3s)). For  the  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  there  is  the  decree  of  Lilaia  in  honour  of     `  (FD iii.4134  (C 3l)). The  polis-town  of  Hierapytna  was  more  than  likely  locat- ed  in  the  vicinity  of  the  modern  city  of  Ierapetra.  To  date almost  nothing  from  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  has come  to  light  (for  a  description  of  the  Archaic  and  Classical material  from  these  periods  on  display  in  the  Archaeological Museum  of  Ierapetra,  see  Papadakis  ( 1986)  77\u00ad80).  On  current  evidence  it  would  seem  that  Hierapytna  was  a  foundation  of  C 5f  at  the  earliest.  Several  public  buildings and  open-air  meeting  places  are  attested  epigraphically: prytaneion  (I.Cret. iii.iii.3C  (C 3l/C2e)); (I.Cret. iii.iv.1  (C 3e));    (I.Cret. iii.iii.4  (C 3l/C2e)).  In  so far  as  these  buildings/open-air  meeting  places  are  attested  at other  Cretan  poleis  during  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods (prytaneion:  see  Lato  (no. 971);  choros:  see  *Eltynia  (no. 958) supra;  Lyktos  (no. 974);  andreion:  see  Axos  (no. 950),  Datala (no. 954)  and  *Eltynia,  no. 958),  it  is  possible  that  also  at Hierapytna  (no. 962)  they  were  pre-Hellenistic. The  protecting  deity  of  the  polis  was  probably  Athene Polias,  in  whose  sanctuary  public  enactments  were  dis- played  (I.Cret. iii.iii.3C,  ll. 9\u00ad10  (C 3l/C2e),  4  ll. 78\u00ad79 (C 3l/C2e),  5  ll. 5\u00ad6  (C 2)). Strabo  indicates  that  the  polis  of  Larisa  (see  Introduction) joined  with  Hierapytna  in  a  synoecism  (Strabo  9.5.19). Larisa  has  been  identified w ith  the  substantial  LM iiiC- Classical  settlement  on  Prophitis  Elias  (Watrous  and  Blitzer ( 1995)).  Surface  remains  indicate  that  this  settlement  was abandoned  by c. 325.  If  the  identification is c orrect,  the  set- tlement  history  of  Larisa  suggests  that  her  synoecism  with Hierapytna  occurred  late  in  the  Classical  period.  The  bor- ders  of  Hierapytna  are  attested  only  in  documents  of  the Hellenistic  period  (Hierapytna  and  Priansos:  I.Cret. iv  174  ll. 30\u00ad32  (C 3l/C2e);  Hierapytna  and  Praisos:  I.Cret. iii.iv.9  ll. 65\u00ad67  (rC 3l/C2f)).At  some  time  before  C 2l  Hierapytna  may have  made  the  Archaic  and  Classical  settlement  at  Oleros (see  Introduction)  a  dependent  polis  whose  territory  either lay  within  or  shared  a  border  with  the  territory  of Hierapytna  (Perlman  ( 1995b)  131\u00ad35,  138\u00ad39). The  names  of  three  tribes,  attested  in  the  dating  formulas of  C 2  magistral  dedications  but  likely  to  be  early  and  so included  here,  have  been  identified as H ierapytnian: \u00b5  (I.Cret. iii.iii.9), \u00b5  (I.Cret. iii.v.1  with Guarducci  ( 1942)  133,  from  Oleros)  and  \u00b5  (I.Cret. iii.ii.1  with  Jones,  POAG 231:  an  unusual  feminine  adjectival form  in  - perhaps  comprising  a  stratum  of  the  population claiming  descent  from  Rhodian  colonists;  from  the  sanctu- ary  of  Zeus  Diktaios  at  Palaikastro).

SEG 42  1663  (C 4s)). The  earliest  reference  to  Elyros  as  a  polis  occurs  in  Ps.- Skylax 47,  who  uses  the  term  in  its  urban  sense.  The  term  is used  in  its  political  sense  in  the  enactment  formulas  of Hellenistic  proxeny  decrees  (e.g.  I.Cret. ii.xiii.1  (C 3/C2)). There  is  little  doubt  that  Elyros  was  a  polis  in  the  political sense  in  the  late  Classical  period.  The  evidence  for  this  is:  (i) inclusion  among  the  poleis  given  grain  by  Cyrene  in  the  320s (SEG 92);  (ii)  participation  in  the  C 4l  federation  of  the Oreioi  (infra);  and  (iii)  striking  coins  as  early  as  c. 330  (infra). Grave stelai  of  C 5/C4  indicate  that  the  polis  town  was  already settled  during  the  Classical  period  (CretChron 9  ( 1955) Chron. 569;  Ergon 1964  ( 1965)  Chron. 150\u00ad51).  It  would  seem probable,  then,  that  Elyros  was  already  a  polis  in  the  political sense  by  the  end  of  the  Classical  period. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  the  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  the  list  of  recipients  of grain  from  Kyrene  during  the  grain  crisis  of  the  320s  (SEG 9 2).  For  the  individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  there  is    '  (SEG 45  1315  (Hellenistic))  from  Lisos. The  terrritory of  Elyros is called  '  (I.Cret. iv  185  (c. 200\u00ad189)).  Stephanos  identifies Sou\u00efa as the harbour  ( ) of  Elyros  (Steph.  Byz. 590.8).  This  may mean  nothing  more  than  that  Sou\u00efa  was  the  most  conven- ient  harbour  for  Elyros  (Perlman  ( 1995b)  132\u00ad34);  but  some level  of  co-operation  between  the  two  communities  is  sug- gested  by  the  aqueduct  (date?)  which  brought  water  from  a source  near  the  village  of  Livadha  to  Elyros  (c. 4.5  km  to  the south-east)  and  thence  to  Sou\u00efa  (Savignoni  and  de  Sanctis ( 1901)  424). Elyros  was  a  member  of  the  C 4l\u00adC3  federation  (van  Effenterre  ( 1948a)  119\u00ad27;  Chaniotis  ( 1996)  106\u00ad8, 421\u00ad22;  cf.  Sekunda  ( 2000)  337\u00ad38:  league  founded  C 3f). Elyros  is  little  known  archaeologically,  although  there  is no  question  that  it  was  settled  already  in  C 5  if  not  earlier  (see e.g.  Baldwin  Bowsky  ( 1997)  for  C 5l  atticising  grave  stelai from  Elyros).  Cf.  Barr.  HRL  only.  The  hill  on  which  the  polis town  was  built  was  protected  by  a  circuit  wall  approximate- ly 3  km  long.  The  summit  of  the  hill  was  perhaps  fortified with  a  second  defence  wall,  and  so  may  be  regarded  as  the acropolis  proper  (Pashley  ( 1837)  ii. 104\u00ad9).  Early  travellers report  the  remains  of  a  theatre  (Savignoni  and  de  Sanctis ( 1901)  424)  and  a  temple  (Pashley  ( 1837)  ii. 104\u00ad9)  near  the church  of  the  Panaghia.  There  is  no  reason  to  identify  this temple  as  that  of  Apollo  (cf.  Pashley  ( 1837)  ii. 104\u00ad9), although  Elyros  did  maintain  particularly  close  ties  with Delphi,  appointing  theorodokoi  at  home  to entertain  the  the- oroi  sent  out  from  Delphi  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iii.106  (c. 230\u00ad210)) and  a  theorodokos  at  Delphi  to entertain  her  own  theoria  to the  festival  there  (I.Cret. ii.xiii.1A  (C 3/C2)).  Pausanias describes  a  bronze  goat  dedicated  by  the  Elyrioi  to Apollo  at Delphi  (Paus. 10.16.5).  The  story  which  Pausanias  tells  con- cerning  this  dedication  suggests  that  the  mythic  founders  of Elyros  were  the  twin  sons  of  Apollo  and  the  nymph Akakallis,  Philandros  and  Philakides  (Frost  ( 1996)).

Bile  suggests that  of  the  two  inflections (theme in - and  theme  in  - ),the theme  in  - perhaps  originated  from  the  accusative  of  the theme  in  - (Bile  ( 1988)  201\u00ad2).

The  earliest  cer- tain  instances  of  the  use  of in  the  political  sense  occur in  the  enactment  formula  of  an  early  decree:  (I.Cret. iv  43Ba3  (C 5e))  and  in  a  provision  of  a  law  of  the same  period  which  requires  that  fines be paid \" to  the  polis\" (I.Cret iv  78  (C 5e)).  For  similar  clauses  in  slightly  later  laws, see  e.g.  I.Cret. iv  41.iii.16\u00ad17  (C 5f),  I.Cret. iv  79  (C 5m).  Cf. also  the  law  concerning  mortuary  practices,       (I.Cret. iv  146  (C 5s\u00adC4e)).  Polis  in  the  urban sense  occurs  in  two  provisions  in  the  Gortyn  Law  Code which  distinguish  houses  located  in  the  polis  from  those  in the  chora  (I.Cret. iv  72.iv.31\u00ad33,  viii. 1\u00ad2  (C 5m)).  For  polis  in the  urban  sense,  see  also  Ps.-Skylax  47,where  Gortyn  is  listed under  the  heading       .  The  broader topographical  use  of  polis  to  mean  the  totality  of  territory occurs  in  two  laws,  the  later  perhaps  a  reformulation  of  the crete  1161 earlier,  which  concern  wages  paid  to  non-citizens  (metics and  slaves)  who  live  in  the  polis.

Ioannis,  Prophitis  Ilias  and  Charki\u00e0  Pervoli, appear  to  have  abandoned  their  hill-top  villages  around  700, most  likely  to  resettle  (  \u00b5  or  in  a  single  settle- ment?)  at  the  foot  of  the  ridge  of  hills  which  marks  the northern  edge  of  the  Mesara  (Allegro  ( 1991);  Di  Vita  ( 1991); La  Torre  ( 1988\u00ad89);  Perlman  ( 2000)).  This  resettlement probably  marks  an  important  step  in  the  formation  of  the polis  of  Gortyn.  Ag.  Ioannis  ( 275  m)  probably  served  as  the acropolis.  In  C 7f(c.675\u00ad650)  an  open-air  sanctuary  on  the  acropolis  was  monumentalised  by  the  construction  of  a temple,  perhaps  in  part  open-air  (Scrinari  ( 1968)  23\u00ad56). The  form  of  the  cella  (tripartite?)  has  been  understood  to imply  that  the  temple  originally  belonged  to  three  deities, but  votive  figurine t ypes  indicate  that  by  the  Classical  peri- od  the  temple  belonged  to  Athena  (Rizza  ( 1968)  191\u00ad93, 249\u00ad50),  who  is  called  Poliouchos  in  Hellenistic  documents (I.Cret. iv  171  (C 3),  183  (c.C 3l/C2e)). Archaeological  exploration  of  Gortyn  has  to  date  yielded few  other  traces  of  the  Archaic  and  Classical  polis  town.  The most  significant of  these  remains  are  the  following.  (i)  The temple  of  Apollo  Pythios  (C 7s)  built  on  the  plain  700  m south-east  of  the  foot  of  the  acropolis  (Ricciardi  ( 1986\u00ad87)), within  which  one  or  two  generations  after  the  construction of  the  Pythion  (C 7l\u00adC6e),  the  Gortynians  began  to  inscribe their  laws  upon  its  walls  (I.Cret. iv  1\u00ad27,  29\u00ad38,  40;  Perlman ( 2002)).  (ii)  The  Gortyn  Law  Code  (I.Cret. iv  72  (C 5m))  was inscribed  boustrophedon  in  columns  on  the  inner  face  of  the walls  of  a  curved  structure  whose  blocks  were  reused  in  the Roman  Odeion  located  below  Ag.  Ioannis  on  the  east  bank of  the  river  Metropolianos.  (iii)  A  second  group  of  similarly inscribed  blocks  (I.Cret. iv  41\u00ad49,  51  (C 5f))  was  reused  in  a rectangular  structure  of  the  Hellenistic  period  (Guarducci ( 1950)  87\u00ad90).This  Hellenistic  building,  parts  of  which  were incorporated  into  the  Odeion,  has  been  interpreted  as  a bouleuterion  (Meinel  ( 1980)  597).  Halbherr  identified some Geometric  material  beneath  the  Odeion  and  traces  of Archaic  walls,  perhaps  belonging  to  a  stoa,  to  its  south-west (Pernier  ( 1925\u00ad26)).  It  is  assumed  that  the  buildings  on which  the  Great  and  Second  Codes  were  inscribed  were located  in  the  same  vicinity;  but  to  date  no  suitable  founda- tions  have  been  found  (Halbherr  ( 1887);  cf.  Di  Vita  in Blackman  ( 1997)  104).  (iv)  A  third  group  of  blocks  bearing inscriptions  dating  to  C 5f  were  reused  in  the  walls  of  the early  Byzantine  church  at  Mavropapas,  located  200  m south-west  of  the  Pythion.  These  blocks  probably  belong  to a  late  Archaic  building  located  in  the  vicinity  of,  if  not directly  under,  the  church  (Halbherr  ( 1897)  170\u00ad219; Perlman  ( 2000)  61\u00ad62:  blocks  came  from  a  public  building associated  with  the  \"collectors  of  fines\"?).  (v)  A sanctuary  (C 6l)  was  established  about  700  m  north-east  of the  Pythion  (Di  Vita  ( 1984)  71:  a  sanctuary  of  Demeter  and Kore?).  Several  public  buildings  (or  open-air  meeting places)  are  attested  in  early  inscriptions:  (i)  agora  (I.Cret. iv 43Bb  (C 6e);  I.Cret. iv  80  (C 5e);  I.Cret. iv  72.vii.11,x.35\u00ad36, xi. 10\u00ad14  (C 5m);  I.Cret. iv  75A,  81  (C 5m);  for  the  location  of the  agora  in  the  vicinity  of  the  later  Roman  Odeion,  see Perlman  ( 2000)  72\u00ad73);  (ii)  (I.Cret. iv  9a\u00adb  (C 7l); Guarducci  ( 1950)  32,  55:  where  the  army  assembled?; Koerner  ( 1993)  367:  where  homicide  trials  took  place?);  (iii)  (I.Cret. iv  72.xi.15\u00ad16  (C 5m);  Guarducci  ( 1950) 169:  building  used  by  the  in  the  agora?  [or  the institution?,  ed.]).  A  stretch  of  wall  contemporary  with  the early  phases  of  the  settlement  on  Ag.  Ioannis  (c. 1190\u00ad970) has  been  identified as a defence wall (Hom.  Il. 2.646:  ;  Rizza  and  Scrinari  ( 1968)  21\u00ad22;  cf.  Hayden ( 1988)  12\u00ad13),  but  Strabo's  claim  that  the  polis  was  unforti- fied until Ptolemy (IV) paid for the c onstruction  of  a  circuit wall  is  supported  archaeologically  (Strabo  10.4.11;Allegro and  Ricciardi  ( 1988)).  Two  toponyms,  Aulon  and  Latosion, have  been  identified as suburbs of  the  polis  town of  Gortyn. For  Aulon,  see  supra  no. 949.  Guarducci  suggests  that Latosion  supra 1146  was  located  in  the  vicinity  of  the  modern village  of  Mitropolis, 1  km  west  of  Gortyn,  and  that  it  was  a district of  the  polis  town  where  metics  and  freedmen  were allowed  to  reside  (Guarducci  ( 1950)  181;  Chaniotis  ( 1996) 162\u00ad63;  cf.  van  Effenterre  and  van  Effenterre  ( 1985)  187\u00ad88). The  name  of  the  territory  was  (Strabo 10.4.7).  There  is  no  evidence  for  territorial  subdivisions,  but Gortyn  may  have  controlled  dependent  poleis  from  as  early 1162 perlman as  C 5e  (infra),  whose  citizens  were  called   (Perlman  ( 1996)  239\u00ad42).  For  settlement  patterns  in  the Mesara  during  the  first millennium,  see  La  Torre  ( 1988\u00ad89); Sanders  ( 1976);  Simpson  et al.( 1995);  Watrous  et al.( 1993). Gortyn's  neighbour  to  the  west  was  Phaistos.  The  two poleis  were  joined  together  in  a  sympoliteia  during  the  peri- od  C 5m\u00adC4m  (coins,  infra;  Cucuzza  ( 1997))  and  again  in  the Hellenistic  period  (I.Cret. iv  165;  SEG 23  563  (both  C 3s); Chaniotis  ( 1996)  104\u00ad8,  422\u00ad28).  Amykalion,  a  dependent community  (polis?)  of  Gortyn  (I.Cret. iv  172  (C 3l); Chaniotis  ( 1996)  399;  cf.  Perlman  ( 1996)  260\u00ad61),  was  prob- ably  located  in  the  vicinity  of  modern  Kommos  (Cucuzza ( 1997)  66\u00ad72).If  so,  it  would  appear  that  Gortyn  had  extend- ed  her  influence,  if  not  her  control,  to  the  western  Mesara  by C 5m  (I.Cret. iv  72.iii.5\u00ad9  (C 5m)).  Mt.  Ida  formed  the  border of  Gortyn  to  the  north-west.  Gortyn  may  have  controlled the  cave  sanctuary  of  Zeus  on  Mt.  Ida  in  the  Classical  period (I.Cret. iv  80  (C 5e),  146  (C 4f)).  Patela  Prinias  commanded the  principal  north\u00adsouth  route  east  of  Mt.  Ida.  The  Archaic community  there  appears  to  have  been  abandoned  c. 550 (Rizza  ( 1991)),  perhaps  a  victim  of  Gortynian  expansion  to the  north.  Henceforth,  Patela  Prinias  occupied  the  frontier between  Gortyn  and  her  northern  neighbour(s).  One  of these  neighbours  was  Rhaukos  (modern  Ag.  Myron?). Gortyn  and  Knosos  destroyed  Rhaukos  (C 2m)  and  divided her  territory  between  themselves.  Thereafter  they  shared  a border  which  appears  to  have  cut  through  what  had  been the  polis  town  of  Rhaukos  (Polyb. 30.23.1;  I.Cret.  IV 182 (C 2m)).  Pyranthos  and  Rhytion  were  perhaps  dependent poleis  located  within  the  territory  of  Gortyn  at  the  eastern edge  of  the  Mesara  (for  Pyranthos,  see  Perlman  ( 1996)  241, 268\u00ad70;  for  Rhytion,  see  ibid. 241,  256\u00ad57,  268\u00ad70).  Further east  were  the  poleis  Arkades  and  Priansos.  A  Hellenistic alliance  of  Gortyn  and  Hierapytna  with  Priansos  describes the  Hellenistic  border  of  Priansos  and  Gortyn  (I.Cret. iv  174 (C 3l)).Several  small  communities  were  located  at  the  south- ern  edge  of  the  Mesara.  The  evidence  for  two  of  these,  Boibe and  Pyloros,  is  not  sufficient t o draw any  conclusions  con- cerning  their  political  status  (for  Boibe,  see  Perlman  ( 1996) 261\u00ad62,  268\u00ad70;  for  Pyloros,  see  ibid. 262,  269).  *Rhitten  may have  been  located  in  the  southern  Mesara  (no. 988).  The largely  uninhabited  Asterousia  mountains  separated  the Mesara  from  several  small  communities  located  on  the  south  coast  of  Crete  (Faure  ( 1965)  37\u00ad40).  They  are (from  east  to  west)  Einatos,  the  harbour  of  Priansos  (no. 985);  Lebena  (no. 972);  Lassoia  (see  supra);  and  Matala  (no. 976).  The  toponyms  Keskora  and  Pala  occur  together  in  a  Gortynian  decree  concerning  the  lease  of  public  lands located  [ ]      \u00b5  (I.Cret. iv  43Ba (C 5e)).  Keskora  and  Pala  were  probably  located  in  the Mesara,  but  nothing  further  about  them  is  known  (Perlman ( 1996)  242\u00ad43). The  terms  (\"citizen\")  and  (\"to exercise  the  rights  of  a  citizen\")  occur  in  the  early  laws  of Gortyn  ( ,  I.Cret. iv  72.x.35\u00ad36,  xi. 14  (C 5m); ,I.Cret.  iv  51  (C 5f);  I.Cret. iv  72.ix.31\u00ad33  (C 5m); cf.  L\u00e9vy  ( 1997)  26:  \"s'il  exerce effectivement  ses  droits  de citoyen\",  that  is,  \"s'il  est  pr\u00e9sent  dans  le  pays\").  Three  other terms  are  associated  with  the  status  of  citizen:  (i)   (e.g.  I.Cret. iv  72.i.1\u00ad7  (C 5m))  \"citizen\"  (L\u00e9vy  ( 1997)  26\u00ad30) or  \"potential  citizen\"  (Bile  ( 1988)  343);  (ii)  \u00b5  (e.g. I.Cret. iv  72.v.40\u00ad42),  new  citizen  who  enjoys  limited  citizen rights  (Tzifopoulos  ( 1998)  150\u00ad69);  (iii)  ( ) (I.Cret. iv  64  (C 5e)),  legal  procedures  for  citizens.  Male  cit- izens  belonged  to  hetaireiai  (I.Cret. iv  42B.11\u00ad14  (C 5f), 72.x.37\u00ad39;  cf. ,  infra).  The  only  civic  subdivision attested  is  the  phyle  ( )  (I.Cret. iv  19,104  (C 7/C6);  I.Cret. iv  72.vii.40\u00adviii.36  (C 5m)).  The  Gortynian  phylai  appear  to have  been  personal  rather  than  territorial  organisations (Jones,  POAG 224\u00ad25).  The  names  of  seven  phylai  are  attest- ed  in  the  dating  formulas  of  public  texts  (decrees,  magistral dedications,  manumissions):  (i)  or  (I.Cret. iv  72.v.5  (C 5m);  I.Cret. iv  142  (C 5m/C4e));  (ii) (I.Cret. iv  196  (C 2f));  (iii)  [...]\u00b5[---] (I.Cret. iv  236  (C 4s/C3f));  (iv)  (I.Cret.iv186B  187 (C 3l/C2e));  (v)  (I.Cret. iv  261  (C 2s/C1f));  (vi) [---] (I.Cret.  iv  171  (C 3f));  (vii)  \u00b5  (I.Cret. iv  197 (C 2f)).  Marriage  within  the  phyle  was  recommended  when possible  (I.Cret. iv  72.vii.40\u00adviii.36  (C 5m);  cf.  Morris ( 1990)).  The  ,  attested  in  the  Gortyn  Law  Code (I.Cret. iv  72.v.5  (C 5m))  and  in  the  treaty  of  Gortyn  and *Rhitten  (I.Cret. iv  80  (C 5e)),  may  represent  a  sub-unit  of the  phyle,  perhaps  the  (Willetts  ( 1955)  111\u00ad13;  cf. Guarducci  ( 1950)  159,185;  Jones,  POAG 225\u00ad26;  Nomima i7). Terms  for  various  categories  of  free  non-citizens  or  that attest  the  presence  of  free  non-citizens  in  the  polis  include  (i) /  ( \u00b5) (I.Cret.  iv  14g\u00adp.1\u00ad2  (C 6),  30 (C 6),  78  (C 5e),  72.xi.16\u00ad17  (C 5m)),  official r esponsible  for foreigners;    (I.Cret. iv  80  (C 5e)),  suits  per- taining  to foreigners;  (iii)  (I.Cret. i.xvi.1  (C 3l)), citizen  of  a  dependent  polis  of  Gortyn  (Perlman  ( 1996) 239\u00ad42);  (iv)  (I.Cret. iv  72.ii.5  (C 5m),  84  (C 5)),  a free  man  denied  citizen  status--bastard,  disenfranchised citizen  vel  sim.  (Willetts  ( 1967)  103\u00ad9;  L\u00e9vy  ( 1997)  26\u00ad28);  (v) [ ---] (I.Cret.  iv  78  (C 5e)),  manumitted  slave (Guarducci  ( 1950)  181;  Chaniotis  ( 1996)  162\u00ad63;  cf.  van crete  1163 Effenterre  and  van  Effenterre  ( 1985)  187\u00ad88;  Nomima i16: [\u00b5  ---]  vel  sim.  (\"expatriate\")).  The  terms ~  and /  (e.g.  I.Cret. iv  72  passim)  desig- nate  categories  of  the  unfree  (L\u00e9vy  ( 1997)  30\u00ad40). The  public  enactments  of  Gortyn  use  the  collective  city- ethnic  (e.g.  . \u017d     [],  I.Cret. iv  78  (C 5e))  and  the  term  (e.g. [ \u017d  ]  [   or ],I.Cret. iv  378C  (C 3))  to refer  to the  assembly.  The  legislative  func- tion  of  the  assembly  is  attested  first in C 5e: '    [] (I.Cret.  iv  78).  The  term   may  refer  to  the  assembly  in  an  early  law  or  decree  (I.Cret. iv 87  (C 5m);  Nomima i97).  A  quasi-judicial  role  as  corporate witness  is  suggested  by  the  requirement  that  both  adoptions and  the  renunciation  of  adoptions  be  declared  in  the  agora when  the  citizens  are  assembled, \u00b5 ~\u00b5 (I.Cret. iv  72.x.35,  xi. 14  (C 5m)).  The  boule  is  not securely  attested  at  Gortyn. occurs  in  an Archaic  law  and  has  been  interpreted  as  either     (\"to the  council)  or  (\"ejectment,  divorce\")  (I.Cret. iv 23.4  (C 6l);  Bile  ( 1988)  156  n. 356). One  member  of  the  annual  board  of \u00b5  (also \u00b5/\u00b5) was eponymous (e.g.  I.Cret. iv  72.v.6 (C 5m),  142  (C 5m/C4e),  236  (C 4s/C3f)).  The  size  of  the board  of \u00b5  is  not  known  (cf.  I.Cret. iv  259  (C 2f):  ten \u00b5  plus  a  ).  The  kosmate  was  organised  by tribe  (I.Cret. iv  72.v.6  (C 5m),236  (C 4s/C3f)).An  Archaic  law on  iteration  restricted  service  to  once  every  three  years (I.Cret. iv  14g\u00adp  (C 6)).  There  is  no  reason  to conclude  that the  \u00b5  (\"kosmos  for  non-citizens\")  was  a member  of  the  board  of \u00b5  (I.Cret. iv  14g\u00adp  (C 6),  30 (C 5e),  78  (C 5e),  79  (C 5m)).  Iteration  was  restricted  to  once every  five y ears  (I.Cret. iv  14g\u00adp2  (C 6)),  and  a  special \"recorder\",  the  \u00b5\u00b5  ~ ,  was  attached  to  the office ( I.Cret. iv  72.xi.6\u00ad23  (C 5m)).  Other  public  officials attested  in  the  early  inscriptions  from  Gortyn  include  (i) (I.Cret. iv  15a\u00adb  (C 7l),  14g\u00adp  (C 6),  78  (C 5e),  79 (C 5m)),\"magistrate  who  fines\"or \" comptroller\"(Bile  ( 1988) 327).  The  term  occurs  in  the  plural  in  two  inscriptions (I.Cret. iv  78  (C 5e),  79  (C 5m)).  They  were  chiefly r esponsi- ble  for  the  collection  of  fines assessed b y  the  polis  against private  individuals  (I.Cret. iv  78  (C 5e))  and  officials ( I.Cret. iv  79  (C 5m)).  (ii)  \u00b5,  \"supervisor\"  vel  sim.(Nomima i 82)  or  \"councillor\"  (Bile  ( 1988)  339).  Iteration  was  restricted to once every  ten  years  (I.Cret. iv  14g\u00adp  (C 6)).  (iii) (I.Cret. iv  75D  (C 5m),  87  (C 5m),  91  (C 5m)), \"collectors  of  fines\".  The  term  is  associated  with  the  verb ,\"to  pay\"  (Bile  ( 1988)  327;  Nomima i97),  and  occurs only  in  the  plural  in  conjunction  with  .  They  seem to  have  been  responsible  primarily  for  the  collection  of  fines assessed  in  judicial  proceedings.  A  special  \u00b5\u00b5 ~ was  attached  to  the  office ( I.Cret. iv  87  (C 5m)). (iv)  (I.Cret. iv  84  (C 5)),\"overseer\"?,\"inspector\"? (Guarducci  ( 1950)  193).  The  function  of  this  official is not known  (Bile  ( 1988)  331  n. 54:  fiduciary official?).  (v) (I.Cret. iv  77  (C 5e))  were probably  responsi- ble  for  the  collection  and  redistribution  of  produce  tithed for  the  syssitia  (Guarducci  ( 1950)  179;  Willetts  ( 1967);  Bile ( 1988)  323;  Nomima i49).  (vi)  .  The  term  occurs in  two  agreements  of  Gortyn  and  dependent  communities: ( 1)  for  the  dependent  polis  of  *Rhitten  (I.Cret. iv  80  (C 5e)) and  ( 2)  for  \"those  living  on  Kaudos\"  (I.Cret. iv  184  SEG 23 589  (C 3l/C2e));  for  the  political  status  of  this  community, see  Chaniotis  ( 1996)  411\u00ad17).  This  suggests  that  the Gortynian  was  an  official involved in the administration  of  dependent  communities  (cf.  Guarducci ( 1950)  186\u00ad87;  Chaniotis  ( 1996)  419\u00ad20).  (vii)   (I.Cret. iv  80  (C 5e)),  \"leader  of  the  startos\"(supra)  or  mili- tary  commander?  (Guarducci  ( 1950)  185).  (viii)  . The  term  does  not  occur  in  the  earliest  laws  of  Gortyn  (see Perlman  ( 2001)  197),  but  is  common  in  the  inscriptions  of C 5  (I.Cret. iv  41  (C 5f),  42B  (C 5f),  45  (C 5f),  72  passim  (C 5m), 76  (C 5m),  106  (C 5m)).  An  unknown  number  of , at  least  some  of  whom  enjoyed  specialised  duties,  served  the polis  (e.g.  the  for  the  hetaireiai  and  for  cases  con- cerning  security  deposits  (I.Cret. iv  42B  (C 5f));  the (I.Cret. iv  72.xii.6\u00ad19  (C 5m));  cf. \u00b5~ ~ ',   ~         (I.Cret. iv  72.vi.25\u00ad31,  ix. 18\u00ad24  (C 5m)).  The  simple  term always  occurs  in  the  singular  (cf.  the  compound ,  I.Cret. iv  72.xii.6\u00ad19  (C 5m)),and  it  seems likely  that  all  cases  were  heard  by  a  single  .The either  \"applied  the  law\", (e.g.  I.Cret. iv 72.iii.5\u00ad9,v.28\u00ad39,  ix. 43\u00ad54  (C 5m)),  or  \"determined  the  facts under  oath\", \u00b5   (e.g.  I.Cret. iv  42B  (C 5f), 72.ix.24\u00ad40,xi.46\u00ad55  (C 5m)).Both  procedures  are  described in  a  law  from  the  Gortyn  Law  Code  (I.Cret. iv  72.xi.26\u00ad31 (C 5m)).  A  \u00b5\u00b5  sometimes  assisted  the  when he  \"applied  the  law\".  Decisions  of  the  could  not  be appealed.

L\u00e9vy  ( 1997)  26).For  the  ,see in  general  Willetts  ( 1967)  127\u00ad34;  Bile  ( 1988)  348\u00ad51. The  legendary  founder  of  Gortyn  was  ,  the  son  of either  Tegeates  according  to  the  Tegeans  or  Rhadamanthys 1164 perlman according  to  the  Cretans  (Paus. 8.53.4\u00ad5).  Conon  preserved a  tradition  that  in  the  third  generation  after  the  conquest  of Amyklai  by  Sparta  (C 8e),  the  Spartans  Pollis  and  Delphos led  a  group  of  Imbrian  and  Lemnian  immigrants  from Lakonian  Amyklai  to  Gortyn,  where  they  settled  together with  some  Cretan  perioikoi  (Conon  (FGrHist 26)  fr. 1.xxxvi; Malkin  ( 1994)  111\u00ad13).  An  early  association  with  Sparta  is suggested  as  well  by  the  tradition  concerning  the  Gortynian poet  and  lawgiver  Thaletas,  who  taught  Lykourgos  and resided  in  Sparta  for  some  time  (Paus. 1.14.4;  doubted  by Arist.  Pol. 2.9,  1274a25\u00ad31).  Plato's  Cretan,  Kleinias,  however, identifed  the  Gortynians  as  Argive  in  origin  (Pl.  Leg. 4.708A; B\u00fcrchner  ( 1912)  1667).  For  the  ethnic  composition  of  the early  polis,  see  Perlman  ( 2000). The  early  inscriptions  of  Gortyn  tell  us  very  little  about  its foreign  relations.  According  to  Strabo,  Gortyn  and  Lyktos temporarily  superseded  Knosos  as  the  foremost  cities  of Crete (Strabo  10.4.7).  If  Strabo's  account  is  historical,  a  like- ly  time  for  the  emergence  of  Gortyn  as  a  leading  power  on the  island  is  C 6\u00adC5  (Hood  and  Smyth  ( 1981)  18\u00ad19).  During the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods  Gortyn  may  have  formu- lated  agreements  with  four  poleis  whose  territories  bordered the  Mesara:  (i)  with  Lebena  (I.Cret. iv  63  (C 6l/C5e));  (ii) with  the  dependent  polis  *Rhitten  (I.Cret. iv  80  (C 5e));  (iii) a  sympoliteia  or  alliance  with  Phaistos  (coins,  infra);  (iv)  a sympoliteia  or  alliance  with  Sybrita?  (coins,  infra).  For aspects  of  Gortyn's  consolidation  of  the  Mesara,  see Perlman  ( 1996)  258\u00ad70;  Cucuzza  ( 1997).  The  Cretan  polis Polichne,  located  west  of  Kydonia  (at  Vryses?),  may  have been  an  ally  of  Gortyn.  In  429  the  Gortynian  ,  prox- enos  of  Athens,  contriving  to support  Polichne,  arranged  for an  Athenian  naval  squadron  to attack  Kydonia  (Thuc. 2.85; Figueira  ( 1988)  538\u00ad42;  cf.  Sekunda  ( 2000)  327\u00ad37: Polichnitai  was  the  name  of  a  federation  of  small  non- Dorian  communities  in  west  Crete).  During  the  grain  crisis of  the  320s,  Gortyn  received  10,000  medimnoi  of  grain  from Kyrene  (SEG 92). Gortyn  struck  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard  from  c. 470 (Price  ( 1981)).  Types  on  the  earliest  staters  (C 5f\u00adC4m)  attest a  sympoliteia  or  alliance  with  Phaistos  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  161). Types:  obv.  Europa  riding  the  bull,  facing  r.;  rev.  lion's  scalp (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  pl.  XI. 8\u00ad19).The  beginning  of  local  coinage at  Gortyn  (staters  and  drachms  with  same  types  as  above)  is indicated  by  the  legend  (rev.)  (   \u00b5) written retrograde in the epichoric alphabet  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pl.  XII. 21,28)  and  somewhat  later (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  pl.  XI. 11\u00ad13).  The  earliest drachms,  hemidrachms  and  obols  have  obv.  recumbent bull;  rev.  lion's  scalp;  legend  (drachm  obv.):  written  retrograde  in  the  epichoric  alphabet  (Svoronos ( 1890)  pl.  XII. 27\u00ad33;  SNG Cop.  Aeg.Isl. 439).  Staters  of  C 4s (c. 360/350\u00ad300)  have  obv.  female  figure (Le Rider ( 1966)  14 n. 1,  Europa  or  Britomartis?)  seated  in  a  tree;  rev.  standing bull;  legend: ,  sometimes  retrograde  in  the epichoric  alphabet  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  pls.  XI. 20\u00adXVIII.18). Drachms  and  obols  of  this  period  (C 4s)  have:  obv.  head  of  a bull;  rev.  head  of  Europa?  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  pls.  XIX. 11\u00ad26, XX. 13\u00ad14).  Sybrita  minted  coins  with  the  same  types  in  C 4s and  may  have  been  joined  with  Gortyn  in  a  sympoliteia  or alliance  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  160\u00ad62).  SNG  Cop.

The  toponym  was  ,   (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iv.14  (c. 230\u00ad210);  Stadiasmus 323).  Cf. (Strabo  10.4.11).  The  city-ethnic  was   (Milet. i.3140.67  ( 259\u00ad250)). The  only  reference  to Matala  as  a  polis  in  the  political sense  occurs  in  the  agreement  of  Miletos           (Milet. i.3140.1,  67  (c. 259\u00ad250)).  Matala probably  served  as  the  harbour  of  Phaistos  during  the Hellenistic  period  (Polyb. 4.55.6  (r 221\u00ad219);  Cucuzza  ( 1997) 85),  although  the  political  ramifications,  if  any,  of  this  are unclear  (Perlman  ( 1995b)  132\u00ad35,  138). Matala  was  clearly  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  in  the  early Hellenistic  period  when  it  co-signed  the  treaty  between Phaistos  and  Miletos  (Milet. i.3140  (c. 259\u00ad250))  and  appoint- ed  at  least  one  theorodokos  to  host  theoroi  from  Delphi  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iv.14  (c. 230\u00ad210)).  The  archaeological  evidence crete  1177 indicates  that  settlement  on  Kastri  was  established  during  the Classical  period  (infra).  Although  no  public  buildings  of  the Classical  period  have  been  identified,  the  combined  evidence of  her  Classical  foundation  and  early  Hellenistic  political  sta- tus  warrants  her  inclusion  in  the  Inventory  as  a  possible  polis (type  C). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally in  Milet. i.3140.67  (c. 259\u00ad250).For  the  individual  use  there  is the  grave  stele  from  Hadra,  Egypt,  of &lt;&gt;   (SB 5860  ZPE 14  ( 1974)  182  (C 3)). The  polis  town  of  ancient  Matala  was  located  on  a  small bay  of  the  Gulf  of  Matala  where  the  modern  village  of Matala  is  situated.  The  earliest  evidence  for  occupation  in the  vicinity  of  the  polis  town,  as  well  as  in  its  hinterland,  is Classical,  although  it  is  not  until  C 3  that  the  ceramic  evid- ence  is  plentiful  (Simpson  et al.( 1995)  397\u00ad99).  No  public buildings  of  the  Classical  (or  even  Hellenistic)  period  have yet  been  identified in the polis  town,  which  is  estimated  to have  covered  an  area  of  at  least  1  ha.  A  high  limestone promontory  (Kastri)  to the  south  of  the  modern  village served  as  the  acropolis.  It  was  fortified during the early Byzantine  period.  Ashlar  blocks  visible  beneath  the  rubble and  concrete  construction  of  the  Byzantine  wall  may  belong to  an  earlier  phase  (ibid. 329,  335).  Rock-cut  cisterns  (at  least thirteen)  and  traces  of  walls  on  the  acropolis  may  attest  the presence  of  houses  (ibid. 335\u00ad37).  The  discovery  of  a  kiln (possibly  one  of  several)  on  the  acropolis,  which  produced good-quality  trade  amphoras,  indicates  commercial  activity there  as  well  (ibid. 336).  A  ship  shed  ( 38  m 5.85  m),  fish tanks  and  houses  were  carved  into  the  cliffs  on  the  south  side of  Matala  Bay  (Blackman  ( 1973)).  Sea-level  changes  indicate a  terminus  ante  quem  of  C 1  for  the  ship  shed  (Gifford  ( 1995) 75\u00ad79).  A  large  structure  ( 21.40  m 13.80  m)  located  c. 3  km south-east  of  Matala  at  Orthes  Petres  may  be  a  heroon  of C 4\u00adC2  (Simpson  et al.( 1995)  342\u00ad43). 977. ", "Phaistos": "Identifier: 981. , (Phaistios) Map. 60.  Lat. 35.05,long.  24.50. Size of  territory: 2.  Type:  [A].  The  toponym  is   (Hom.  Il. 2.648;  Ps.-Skylax 47;  Milet. i.3140  (c. 259\u00ad250)),  in Linear  B,  pa-i-to  (McArthur  ( 1993)  21\u00ad23).  The  city-ethnic  is (coins,  from  C 5m,  infra;  the  ktetikon ,  written  retrograde  in  epichoric  script, occurs  on  staters  of  C 4s  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  195  pl.  XXI. 7\u00ad10). For polis  in  the  urban  sense,  see  Ps.-Skylax  47,where Phaistos  is  listed  under  the  heading       .  The  earliest  reference  to  Phaistos  as  a  polis  in  the political  sense  occurs  in  the  agreement  of  Miletos        (Milet. i.3140.1,  51  (c. 259\u00ad250)).  An Archaic  law  concerning  the  renunciation  of  an  adoption (SEG 32  908  (C 6))  and  the  mint,  which  commences  C 5f (infra),  provide  the  best  evidence  that  Phaistos  was  a  polis  in the  political  sense  already  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  peri- ods. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  the  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  the  agreement  of Miletos           (Milet. i.3140.51 (c. 259\u00ad250)).  For  the  individual  use  there  are  the  two  bene- factors  of  Kydonia, \u00b5   and  (I.Cret. i.x.1  (C 3)). Phaistos  shared  a  border  with  Gortyn  to  the  east.  The Asterousia  mountains  formed  the  frontier  between  Phaistos and  the  coastal  community  of  Lassoia,  probably  a  polis  dur- ing  the  Hellenistic  period  (see  Introduction),  to  the  south. To  the  west,  Kommos  (perhaps  ancient  Amyklaion,  see Introduction;  s.v.  Gortyn  (no. 960))  may  have  served  as  a harbour  for  Phaistos,  as  did  Matala  (no. 976),  at  least  during the  Hellenistic  period  (Cucuzza  ( 1997)  85).  To  the  north  lay Mt.  Ida. The  earliest  coinage  of  Phaistos  and  Gortyn  indicates  that the  two  poleis  had  arranged  a  sympoliteia  by C 5m  (infra),  as do  Hellenistic  references  to  Phaistos  as  the     and Gortyn  as  the     (I.Cret. iv  165;  SEG 23  563  (both C 3s);  Chaniotis  ( 1996)  104\u00ad8,  422\u00ad28).  I.Cret. iv  165,a law enacted  by  Phaistos  and  Gortyn  (      ), refers  to  Phaistos  both  by  name  and  by  the  phrase   .  SEG 23  563,  an  alliance  with  Axos,  refers  to  the  two communities  as          (Phaistos  is  not  referred  to  by  name  in  what  survives  of  the text).  Gortyn  destroyed  Phaistos  and  incorporated  her territory c. 150  (Strabo  10.4.14;  Cucuzza  ( 1997)  87\u00ad90). Apart  from  the  Archaic  law  which  requires  that  the renunciation  of  an  adoption  take  place     [  ---] (SEG 32  908  (C 6l)),  the  remaining  evidence  for  the  political  insti- tutions  of  the  polis  is  Hellenistic. During  C 8\u00adC7  a  substantial  settlement  occupied  the same  ridge  with  its  three  low  hills  (from  west  to  east: Christos  Efendis,  Middle  Hill  and  Palace  Hill)  as  the  Minoan  palace  and  town  (Cucuzza  ( 1998);  La  Rosa  ( 1992); Levi ( 1964),  ( 1967\u00ad68);  Palermo  ( 1992)).  Remains  of  the Archaic  and  Classical  periods  are  scanty  (for  the  Archaic period,  see  La  Rosa  ( 1996)).It  may  be  that  early  in  C 6  the  set- tlement  moved  down  from  the  hills  on  to  the  plain  where  no excavations  have  taken  place.  If  so,  Middle  Hill,  the  highest of  the  three  hills  (altitude  110  m)  and  fortified during the Subminoan/Protogeometric\u00adGeometric  periods,  probably served  as  the  acropolis  of  the  polis  town.  The  only  public building  securely  identified as A rchaic  is  the  C 7l\u00adC6  temple located  near  a  Geometric  residential  district  west  of  the Palace  (La  Rosa  ( 1996)  68\u00ad82).  The  temple,  traditionally assigned  to  Rhea  or  the  \"Magna  Mater\",  may  have  belonged to  Leto  (Cucuzza  ( 1993)).  The  identification of  a  second C 7\u00adC6  building,  located  at  Phalandra, 300  m  to the  west  of the  Minoan  palace,  as  a  temple  remains  uncertain  (Levi ( 1961\u00ad62)  462\u00ad67;  cf.  Mazarakis  Ainian  ( 1997)  229\u00ad30).  The phrase     [  ---] occurs in an Archaic law inscribed  on  a  building  block  (SEG 32  908  (C 6l)).  If  it  refers  to the meeting  place,  and  not  to  the  meeting,  the  location  of  its  dis- covery  in  the  plain  80  m  west  of  Chalara  may  indicate  where the  public  centre  of  the  Archaic  polis  lay.  For  other  Archaic remains  from  Phaistos  (architectural  fragments  in  poros, walls  and  deposits),  see  La  Rosa  ( 1996).  A  Hellenistic inscription  mentions       (the adjective  suggesting  more  than  one  court  at  Phaistos?)  and the  prytaneion  (Milet. i.3140.61\u00ad62,  66  (c. 259\u00ad250);  for  the prytaneion,  see  Viviers  ( 1994)  244).  In  so  far  as  both  terms are  attested  elsewhere  on  Crete  during  the  Archaic  and Classical  periods  (dikasterion:  see  Bionnos?  (no. 952)  and Gortyn  (no. 960),  supra;  prytaneion:  see  Lato,  supra)  it  is possible  that  also  at  Phaistos  they  were  pre-Hellenistic. Phaistos  struck  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard  from c. 470  (Price  ( 1981)).  Types  on  the  earliest  staters  (C 5f\u00adC4m) attest  a  sympoliteia  or  alliance  with  Gortyn  (Le  Rider  ( 1966) 161).  Types:  obv.  Europa  riding  a  bull,  facing  l.;  rev.  lion's scalp  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  pl.  XX. 19\u00ad24).  The  beginning  of  local coinage  at  Phaistos  (stater  with  same  types  as  above)  is  indi- cated  by  the  legend  (rev.)  (   \u00b5) written retrograde in the epichoric alphabet  (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pl.  XXII. 34;  Wroth  and  Poole ( 1963)  pl.  XIV. 14).  A  rarer  early  stater  has  obv.  Europa  riding a  bull;  rev.  head  of  Hermes  (Le  Rider  ( 1966)  pl.  XX. 23).In  the next  phase  (c. 360\u00ad340/30)  Phaistos  adopts  new  types  for  its staters  (no  legend):  (i)  obv.  seated  Europa  with  bull;  rev. 1180 perlman seated  Hermes;  (ii)  obv.  head  of  Europa;  rev.  bull  protome (drachms  also,  Svoronos  ( 1890)  pl.

Staters  of  the  following  period  ( 340/330\u00ad322)  have  obv. Herakles  standing,  holding  his  bow  and  club;  rev.  bull  or  a frontal  bull's  head;  legend: written  retro- grade  in  the  epichoric  alphabet  on  some  (Le  Rider  ( 1966) pls.

Lyktos  was resettled  both  times,  in  the  first instance w ith  the  help  of King  Archidamos  of  Sparta  (Diod. 16.62.4). Two  of  the  Archaic  laws  of  Lyktos  preserve  the  enactment formula     (SEG 35  991A.1  and  B. 1 (C 6l/C5e)).  SEG 35  991A  concerns  the  exclusion  of ,  non-citizens,  foreigners,  or  expatriates  (van Effenterre  and  van  Effenterre  ( 1985)  179\u00ad88),  and  assesses fines against those who harbour them.  The  same  term  may be  restored  in  another  of  the  Archaic  laws  ([ ] in  I.Cret. i.xviii.2  (C 6l));  on  the  other  hand,  this  text  may preserve  the  term for  citizen, .  The  only  social  sta- tus  term  that  occurs  in  the  early  inscriptions  from  Lyktos  is (I.Cret. i.xviii.5  (C 6l)).  The  occurrence  of  the terms \u00b5[---] (\"witness\")  and  [---  ] \u00b5\u00b5  (\"co- swearer\")  in  the  lines  immediately  preceding  indi- cate  that  the  context  of  the  reference  is  a  law  concerning judicial  procedure.  The  kosmate  is  referred  to  in  two  laws (I.Cret. i.xviii.2  (C 6l);  SEG 35  991A4\u00ad5  (C 6l/C5e));  in  neither case  is  the  context  certain.  The  term  \u00b5  (for  the meaning,  \"kosmos  elect\"  or  \"ex-kosmos\",  see  Bile  ( 1988)  274) occurs  together  with  kosmos  in  SEG 35  991A.  Other  public officials mentioned in the A rchaic  laws,  again  in  uncertain contexts,  are  dikastai  ([--- ]  ,  I.Cret. i.xviii.3  (C 6l)) and    (SEG 35  991A.8  (C 6l/C5e);  van Effenterre  and  van  Effenterre  ( 1985)  176:  \"supervisors\"; Chadwick  ( 1987)  332\u00ad33:  officials who c ollect  fines).  The  col- lective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  in  the  Archaic  enactment  for- mula    probably  refers  to the  assembly (SEG 35  991A.1  and  B. 1  (C 6l/C5e)),  as  does  the  term  in a  Hellenistic  enactment  formula,    \u00b5     (I.Cret. i.xviii.8  (C 3m)).  The  coun- cil  ( )  may  be  referred  to  in  the  Archaic  law  concerning and  may  have  enjoyed  legislative  powers, [ ]       (SEG 35  991A.6  (C 6l);  Chadwick ( 1987)  331\u00ad32:  \"[on  account  of]?  the  decree  of  the  Council\"; cf.  van  Effenterre  and  van  Effenterre  ( 1985)  167\u00ad68,  175: ]    ,\"par l'application de la loi de exoul\u00e9\"). Although  the  phylai  appear  only  in  Hellenistic  and  later sources,  they  are  likely  to  be  early  and  so  are  mentioned  here. Four  tribal  names  are  attested:  (i)  (I.Cret. i.xviii.12 (Imperial));  (ii)  (IG ii\u00b2  1135  ( 111/10));  (iii)  \u00b5 (I.Cret. i.xviii.8  (C 3m));  (iv)  (I.Cret. i.xviii.13 (Imperial)).  De  Sanctis  in  Guarducci  ( 1935)  192  restored [ `]()  ,  but  the  tribal  name  is  attested in  a  C 2l  inscription  from  the  sanctuary  of  Hermes  and Aphrodite  at  Kato  Syme  Biannou  (Kritzas  ( 2000)). An  Archaic  decree  of  Lyktos  describes  the  border  of  pub- lic(?)  grazing  lands  within  the  polis  of  Lyktos  (SEG 35 991B.4\u00ad14  (C 6l/C5e)).  This  text  has  been  understood  to indicate  the  existence  of  state-owned  livestock  (van Effenterre  and  van  Effenterre  ( 1985)  182\u00ad85;  cf.  Chaniotis ( 1995)  46\u00ad48).  Late  in  the  Archaic  period  Lyktos  perhaps shared  a  border  with  Datala  (no. 954).  A  Hellenistic  treaty between  Hierapytna  and  Lato  mentions  an  earlier  written description  of  the  ancient  border  between  Lyktos  and  Lato,      (SEG 26  1049.60\u00ad62 (C 3/C2)).  *Chersonasos  and  Lyktos  are  known  to  have joined  in  a  sympoliteia  some  time  after  c. 183  (Chaniotis ( 1996)  104\u00ad8,  430\u00ad32).  Henceforth  the  official name of *Chersonasos  was  \"Lyktos  by  the  sea\",  to  distinguish  it  from the  upper  ( )  polis  (e.g.  I.Cret. i.xix.3A  (c. 183)).  A  refer- ence  to  \"those  up  above\"  (    ) in an Archaic law from  Lyktos  (I.Cret. i.xviii.1  (c. 550\u00ad525))  has  been  under- stood  to  distinguish  the  upper  city  (Lyktos)  from  the  coastal city  (*Chersonasos)  and  so  to  indicate  that  the  sympoliteia (or  some  other  form  of  political  arrangement)  was  much earlier  (Viviers  ( 1994)  252\u00ad54). Lyktos  is  largely  unknown  archaeologically.  The  polis town  occupied  the  summit  of  a  ridge  overlooking  the upland  plain  of  Pediadha  (cf.  van  Effenterre  and  Gondiccas ( 1999):  the  Archaic  and  Classical  polis  did  not  have  an  urban centre  but  was  settled  \u00b5).The ridge has three peaks, 1176 perlman the  tallest  of  which  should  perhaps  be  regarded  as  the  acrop- olis.  The  earliest  evidence  for  occupation  seems  to  date  to the  late  Geometric  or  early  Archaic  period.  Buildings  of  the Archaic  (C 7l\u00adC6e:  CretChron 11  ( 1957)  336)  and  Classical (C 5s:  CretChron  23  ( 1971)  496\u00ad97)  periods  have  been  exca- vated,  although  later  phases  (Hellenistic  and  Roman)  of Lyktos  are  better  attested  archaeologically.  A  substantial building,  perhaps  a  temple,  once  occupied  the  summit  of the  acropolis.  The  protecting  deity  of  Lyktos  was  probably Athene  Polias  (I.Cret. iii.iii.3B  (C 3l/C2e);  SEG 33  638  (C 2l)). The  earlier  of  these  two  texts  was  to  be  displayed  in  the  sanc- tuary  of  Athena  \u00b5  ,  perhaps  a  reference  to the  temple on  the  acropolis.  A  choros  ([---] | ,dat. sing.  or  nom. pl.?)  is  attested  epigraphically  (I.Cret. i.xviii.4  (C 6l);  Bile ( 1988)  344  n. 84:  agora;  Kritzas  ( 1992\u00ad93)  282\u00ad89:  dance floor).  The  theatre  (date?),  which  was  described  and  drawn by  Onorio  Belli  in  1586,  was  probably  located  at  the  foot  of the  acropolis  (Falkener  ( 1854)  17\u00ad19;  Branigan  ( 1979c)).  An Archaic  cemetery  has  been  partly  excavated  at  \"these Alonas\"  near  the  village  of  Xida  (ArchDelt 41  ( 1986)  Chron. 407).  The  extent  of  the  polis  town  is  estimated  to  have  been c. 100  ha  (Rhethemiotaki  ( 1984)). Lyktos  struck  coins  (staters,  drachms,  hemidrachms)  on the  Aiginetan  standard  from  C 5f  onwards  (Price  ( 1981): c. 470\u00ad450;  cf.  Le Rider  ( 1966)  174,  195\u00ad96:  c. 425).All  denom- inations  use  the  same  types:  obv.  eagle,  flying or standing; rev.  boar's  head  within  square  frame;  legend,  in  the  epichor- ic  alphabet  until  C 4l: ,  ,or (Svoronos  ( 1890)  pl.

The-city  ethnic  is  (I.Cret. i.xxii.4A.39  (C 3f))  or  (I.Cret. ii.iii.1  (C 3l)).  Both forms  of  the  city-ethnic  occur  on  the  earliest  coins  (C 4s/C3f; infra).  The  literary  sources  use  only  the  forms  in  - - (Steph. Byz. 107.8,  15;Polyb.  4.55.4).  Bile  (( 1988)  80)  argues  that  the original  forms  were in  - -,  but  forms  with  - - and with -- appear  in  the  earliest  sources. Pausanias  refers  indirectly  to  Aptara  as  a  polis,presum- ably  in  the  political  sense,  in  his  account  of  the  Second Messenian  War  when  the  Aptaraioi  sent  archers  to support the  Lakedaimonioi  (Paus. 4.19.4,with  4.20.8  (rC 7l)).The  first certain  reference  to Aptara  as  a  polis  in  the  political  sense, however,  occurs  in  the  alliance  of  Aptara  with  Eleutherna (SEG 41  742  (C 2e)).  The  earliest  reference  to  Aptara  as  a  polis in  the  topographical  sense  occurs  in  a  C 2f  honorary  decree (I.Cret. ii.iii.4C).  There  is  no  proof  that  Aptara  was  a  polis  in the  Classical  period,  but  Pausanias'  retrospective  reference to  the  Apteraioi,  the  coins  which  may  be  as  early  as  c. 330 (infra)  and  the  public  buildings  of  C 5  and  C 4  (infra)  recom- mend  the  inclusion  of  Aptara  in  the  Inventory  as  a  probable polis  (type  B). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally on  the  coins  of  C 4s\u00adC3f(infra).  For  the  collective use  exter- nally  there  is  Pausanias'  reference  to     (Paus. 4.20.8  (rC 7l)).  For  the  individual  use  there  is  the  proxenos  of  Olous,     (I.Cret. i.xxii.4A  (C 3f)). The  territory is  called   (Ps.-Skylax 47). An honorary decree  of  C 2m  mentions  harbours, \u00b5  (I.Cret. ii.iii.4C).  One  of  these  harbours  was Kisamos  (Strabo  10.4.13),  perhaps  to  be  identified w ith  the ancient  remains  on  the  coast  between  Kalami,  where  an ancient  mole  has  been  identified,  and  Kalybes  (Sanders ( 1982)  165  ( 17/1)). Apart  from  the  reference  to   in  Pausanias'  account  of  the  Second  Messenian  War (Paus. 4.20.8  (rC 7l)),  evidence  for  the  history  and  political institutions  of  Aptara  dates  no  earlier  than  the  Hellenistic period. The  polis  town  of  Aptara  was  located  on  a  plateau (Palaiokastro,  Megala  Khoraphia,  altitude  231  m)  overlook- ing  Suda  Bay.  Palaiokastro  appears  to  have  been  continu- ously  settled  from  C 8  on  (for  a  general  description,  see Blackman  ( 1976a);  for  the  settlement  history,  see  AR 42 ( 1996)  47).  Bronze  Age  a-pa-ta-wa  (McArthur  ( 1993) 127\u00ad28)  was  perhaps  located  c. 6  km  to  the  north  at  Stylos, where  in  addition  to  Bronze  Age  remains  an  important  C 7 building  has  been  excavated  (KrEst 7  ( 1999)  175\u00ad77).  The Geometric,  Classical  and  Hellenistic  periods  are  represent- ed  in  the  cemetery,  which  was  located  outside  the  city  wall  in the  saddle  to  the  west,  near  the  village  of  Megala  Khoraphia (Drerup  ( 1951a)  95;  CretChron 12  ( 1958)  468\u00ad69;  KrEst 5 ( 1997)  208).  City  walls  (date?)  c. 4  km  in  length  surround  the entire  plateau,  enclosing  an  area  of  c. 63  ha.  The  several masonry  styles  (west:  iso-  or  pseudo-isodomic;  east:  polyg- onal)  may  suggest  several  phases  of  construction  (Drerup ( 1951a)  90\u00ad92;  Blackman  ( 1976a);  cf.  Coutsinas  ( 2001) 64\u00ad66).  The  plateau  was  certainly  fortified at the time of  the Lyktian  War  (Polyb. 4.55.4  (r 221\u00ad219)).Possible  traces  of  ear- lier  walls  have  been  noted  at  the  eastern  edge  of  the  plateau (Blackman  ( 1976a)).  A  section  of  paved  road  running north\u00adsouth  has  been  excavated  towards  the  centre  of  the plateau  (KrEst 5  ( 1997)  208\u00ad11).  Several  cult  sites  have  been identified in this same area:  (i)  a  small  temple  with  a  double cella  of  the  Classical  period  (Drerup  ( 1951b));  (ii)  a  Classical periobolos  and  small  altar;  (iii)  a  second  Classical  peribolos with  a  pyre  and  a  large  building  (temple?)  in  an  area  which was  in  use  from  C 8  (KrEst 5  ( 1997)  208\u00ad11).  A  Hellenistic inscription  may  refer  to  the  prytaneion  (I.Cret. ii.iii.2  (C 2f), inferred  from  the  invitation     ...[  ]  [ ]).  If  so,  in  so  far  as  the  prytaneion  is  attested  else- where  on  Crete  during  the  Classical  period  (see  Lato,  infra), it  is  possible  that  the  one  at  Aptara  was  also  pre-Hellenistic. The  extent  of  the  enclosed  area  indicates  that  not  only  the public  buildings  of  the  polis  but  also  its  residential  districts crete  1151 were  intra-mural.  The  protecting  deity  of  Aptara  was Artemis  Aptara,  whose  sanctuary  is  attested  epigraphically (I.Cret. ii.iii.2  (C 2f)). Aptara  struck  coins  (staters,  hemidrachms)  on  the Aiginetan  standard  during  the  period  c. 330\u00ad280/270  (Le Rider  ( 1966)  190,  198).

The  collec- tive  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  internally  on  Hellenistic coins  (infra)  and  in  the  citizenship  decree  SEG 17  639.3\u00ad4 (C 4l/C3e);  externally  it  is  found  in  an  Argive  decree  in  honour  of  Aspendos  (SEG 34  282.4  (c. 330\u00ad300))  as  well  as  in literary  sources  (Theopomp.  fr. 103.13;Xen.  Hell. 4.8.30).  For the  individual  and  external  use,  see  the  Argive  decree  (SEG 34  282.18  ( 330\u00ad300)). Aspendos  is  placed  in  Pamphylia  by  Ps.-Skylax  101  and Steph.  Byz. 134.10.  The  territory  is  called  in Theopomp.  fr. 9  and  is  termed  by Diod. 14.99.4  (r 388) and  Arr.  Anab. 1.26.5  (r 333).  Its  extent  was  disputed  by  its neighbours  (Arr.  Anab. 1.27.4);  the  dispute  may  have  been with  Side  (no. 1004)  (Bean  ( 1979)  47  n. 1),  with  whom  rela- tions  were  bad  (Polyb. 5.73.4). According  to Hellan.  fr. 15,  Aspendos  was  founded  by the hero  Aspendos.  Other  versions  of  the  foundation  myth  are found  in  later  sources:  e.g.  that  it  was  an  Argive  foundation (Strabo  14.4.2).  However,  Mopsos,  the  legendary  founder  of Pamphylian  cities  (cf.  Hereward  ( 1958)  58  with  refs.),  has been  suggested  as  the  oecist  of  Aspendos  too  (Robert  ( 1960) 177\u00ad78,who  connects  the  coin  types  of  a  horseman  hurling  a spear  and  of  a  boar  (infra)  with  the  tradition  of  Mopsos'  sac- rifice of  a  boar  to  Aphrodite  Kastnietis  in  Aspendos;  cf. Strabo  9.5.17;  Callim.  Dieg. viii.41\u00adix.1\u00ad11,  Pfeiffer). 1214 keen  and  fischer-hansen The  tradition  of  an  Argive  foundation  of  Aspendos  (and Soloi  (no. 1011))  is  the  background  for  the  decree  of c. 330\u00ad300  (from  Nemea)  in  which  Argos  (no. 347)  bestowed citizenship  on  the  Aspendians  (who  are  described  as [     ]) and granted the privilege of access  to  the  Argive  assembly  (Stroud  ( 1984)  200\u00ad1,  206). Aspendian  theoroi  were  sent  to  Nemea  and  to  Argos  to  par- ticipate  in  offerings  to  Zeus  and  Hera;  the  Aspendians  were possibly  granted  prohedria  (the  reading  is  uncertain:  Stroud ( 1984)  203\u00ad4). It  has  been  suggested  that  Aspendos  became  a  member  of the  Delian  League  in  the  450s  (Meiggs  ( 1972)  58,102);  but  the only  evidence  of  League  membership  is  the  restoration [ ]  [ \u00b5  \u00b5]  in  the  assessment  decree  of 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.155\u00ad56).  Aspendos  was  possibly  under Kilikian  control  c. 401  (Xen.  An. 1.2.12,  a  passage  which  dis- tinguishes  between  Kilikians  and  Aspendians).  In  388  the Aspendians  were  forced  to  pay  a  contribution  to  the Athenian  commander  Thrasyboulos,  but  later  killed  him  in revenge  for  the  conduct  of  his  soldiers  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.30).  In 333  Aspendos  sent     to  Alexander the  Great  (Arr.  Anab. 1.26.2)  and  was  a  subordinate  party  to a  treaty  with  him  (Staatsvertr\u00e4ge 405). The  earliest  evidence  for  public  enactments  is  a  decree  of C 4l/C3e  granting  citizenship  to  mercenaries  (SEG 17  639). This  decree  attests  a  number  of  institutions  indicative  of polis  status.  Apart  from  those  already  mentioned  are  an eponymous  \u00b5  ( 1),  an  ( 2),  and  a      \u00b5  ( 13\u00ad14).  A  citizen  of  Aspendos  was  granted proxenia  by  Anaphe  (no. 474)  (IG xii.3250;  cf.  SEG 41  1788 (C 4l/C3e)). Aphrodite  Kastnietis,  named  after  the  mountain  on which  Aspendos  was  founded,  had  a  cult  in  the  city  (Brandt ( 1988)  241  with  refs.;  cf.  supra).  The  C 4l\u00adC3e  citizenship decree  (supra)  mentions  a  sanctuary  of  Artemis  (SEG 17 639.13\u00ad14;  Brandt  ( 1988)  241).C4\u00adC3  coins  (infra)  testify  to  a cult  of  Athena  (Brandt  ( 1988)  242),  and  a  cult  of  Zeus  and Hera  has  been  surmised  on  the  basis  of  a  late  dedication (SEG 17  641;  Robert  ( 1960)  187\u00ad88;  Brandt  ( 1988)  243).  The kerykeion  of  Hermes  on  C 5\u00adC1  coins  may  indicate  a  cult  of this  divinity  as  well  (Brandt  ( 1988)  247). Aspendos  was  situated  in  the  plain  below  the  foothills  of the  Tauros  mountains;  it  was  on  the  river  Eurymedon  and  in Antiquity  was  accessible  for  trade  by  sea  (Xen.  Hell. 4.8.30; Ps.-Skylax 101).  In  333  it  had  a  walled  acropolis  ( ) and a defence  circuit  enclosing  the  lower  city  (Arr.  Anab. 1.26.5\u00ad27.3).There  are  no  urban  remains  from  the  Greek  his- tory  of  the  city. Aspendos  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Persian  standard from  C 5e.  ( 1)  Staters.

Byz. 327.2,  who  may  quote  Hekataios  for  the  site- classification and not just for the t oponym  (Hecat.  fr. 260)). If  the  identification of  Ityra  with  Idyros  is  accepted,  the  pre- sumption  is  that  it  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League  and  a polis  in  the  political  sense  too:  at  least,  it  was  assessed  for tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.147  ( 4,000  dr.)).  It  belonged  to  the Ionian  district,  which  by  then  included  the  members  of  the former  Karian  district. Idyros  is  placed  in  Pamphylia  by  Steph.  Byz. 327.1,possibly citing  Hekataios  (fr. 260);  Ps.-Skylax  100  places  it  in  Lykia. Idyros'  location  is  uncertain  (Ruge  ( 1916);  cf.  TAVO  BV 15,15.2  and  Barr. 65).  It  is  normally  identified w ith  the  ruins the  south  coast  of  asia  minor  1215 found  at  modern  Kemer  on  the  Lykian  Pamphylian  border (\u00d6zoral  ( 1980)).  The  1980  investigation  identified no Classical  or  Hellenistic  remains.  Hecat.  fr. 260,  as  cited  by Steph.  Byz. 327.1,  associates  Idyros  with  a  homonymous river,  also  mentioned  by  Theophr.  fr. 5.53  (cf.

Anab. 1.26.1  (r 333);  Strabo  14.4.2;  IG i\u00b3  71.ii.113  ( 425/4)).  The city-ethnic  is  (Arr.  Anab. 1.25.9  (r 333));  possibly Graeco\u00adPamphylian  on  inscriptions  (Merkelbach and  S \u017eahin  ( 1988)  no. 1  (C 5l/C4e)).  Perge  is  called  a  polis  in the  urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skylax  100.  The  collective use  of  the city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  Arr.  Anab. 1.25.9  (r 333) (Pergaian  guides  used  by Alexander). Perge  may  have  been  one  of  the  cities  allegedly  founded by  a  mixed  contingent  of  people,  led  by  Amphilochos, Mopsos  and  Kalchas,  in  the  aftermath  of  the  fall  of  Troy,  but the  city  is  not  specifically mentioned in the sources (cf.  Hdt. 7.91;Strabo 14.4.3).  Statues  of  mythological  founders, including  Mopsos  and  Kalchas,  stood  at  the  main  gates  of Roman  Perge,  as  revealed  by  inscriptions  on  bases (Merkelbach  and  S \u017eahin  ( 1988)  nos. 24,27,imp.;  S \u017eahin  ( 1999) 140\u00ad45;  for  Mopsos,  see  Hanfmann  ( 1958)).  Olshausen ( 1972)  suggests  that  Perge  was  in  fact  founded  in  the Mycenaean  period  from  the  Argolid  and  Sparta.  A  Graeco- Pamphylian  dialect  was  spoken  in  Perge  (SGDI 1265; Ramsay  ( 1880)  246;  Blumenthal  ( 1963)  46;  Brixhe  ( 1976)). Perge  was  probably  an  indigenous  community  gradually Hellenised  from  C 7  onwards  (Martin  ( 2000)  562). Perge  was  probably  a  member  of  the  Delian  League;  at least,  it  was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.ii.113).  In 333  Alexander  sent  part  of  his  force  inland  to Perge,  whereas he  himself  took  the  route  along  the  coast  (Arr.  Anab. 1.26.1). Perge  is  placed  in  Lykia  by  Ps.-Skylax  (see  supra,  intro- duction),  and  in  Pamphylia  by  Strabo.  The  territory  of  Perge may  have  extended  westwards  to  Telmessos  and  eastwards  to the  river  Kastros,  according  to  the  distribution  of  inscrip- tions  honouring  Artemis  Pergaia  and  coin  finds ( Jameson ( 1974)  376). The  city  of  Perge  lay  on  a  50  m-high,  flat plateau border- ing  upon  the  plain  of  Pamphylia,  at  modern  Murtana;  the city  could  be  reached  by  the  river  Kestros  (Strabo  14.4.2). The  size  of  the  Roman  settlement  area  was  c. 61  ha  (Jameson ( 1974)  375),but  the  original  Greek  settlement  probably  com- prised  only  the  northern  part  of  the  site,  the  so-called Acropolis  Hill.  The  earliest  extant  urban  remains  are  the  C 3 city  walls  and  the  Hellenistic  Doric  temple  outside  the southern  gate  (Bean  ( 1979)  25\u00ad38;  MacKay  ( 1990)  2078). A  temple  and  a  cult  of  Artemis  Pergaia  (Wanassa  Preiia)  is known  from  Ps.-Skylax  100  and  Strabo  14.4.2  (cf.  Brandt ( 1992)).  According  to  Strabo,  the  location  of  the  sanctuary was  extra-urban  ( 14.4.2)  (such  a  location  is  probably  also  to be  inferred  from  Ps.-Skylax  100;  cf.  Jameson  ( 1974)  381  for further  refs.).  Remains  of  the  Classical  sanctuary  have  not been  identified,  but  remains  of  a  C 3\u00adC2  Doric  temple  and fragments  from  a  large  Ionic  temple  outside  the  south  gate of  the  city  have  revealed  a  major  sanctuary  (MacKay  ( 1990) 2066\u00ad67),  possibly  that  of  Artemis  Pergaia.  The  cult  with  its annual  festival  (Strabo  14.4.2)  is  at  least  as  old  as  the C 5e\u00adC4e  dedication  of    (Merkelbach and  S \u017eahin  ( 1988)  no. 1;  Ps.-Skylax 100;Strabo 14.4.2;  Brandt ( 1992);  Lebrun  ( 1992);  MacKay  ( 1990)  2048;  cf.  also  the  C 4 inscription  from  Naukratis  (SGDI 5772);  full  survey: MacKay ( 1990)  2048\u00ad58).  The  goddess  was  honoured  by Pamphylians  in  general. 1004.Side  (Sidetes) Map  65.  Lat. 36.45,long.  31.25.  Size  of territory: 4.  Type:  A: .  The  toponym  is  ,  (Hecat.  fr. 262  Steph.  Byz. 565.10;  Ps.-Skylax 101;Arr.  Anab. 1.26.4 (r 333);  Strabo  14.4.2),  from  Graeco\u00adPamphylian  Sibd\u00ea.The city-ethnic  is  (Arr.  Anab. 1.26.4)  or   (Noll\u00e9  ( 1993)  225,TEp 22).  It  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban sense  by  Ps.-Skylax  101  (who  adds   \u00b5).The collective use  of  the  city-ethnic  may  be  attested  internally  in  abbrevi- ated  form  on  a  unique  coin  of  C 5m  (infra).  It  is  attested externally  in  an  Attic  list  of  mercenaries  (IG ii\u00b2  1956.132 (c. 300))  and  in  literary  sources  (Arr.  Anab. 1.26.4\u00ad5).  The individual  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  externally  in  C 4 sepulchral  monuments  from  Rhodos  (I.Side 225,TEp 22) and  Attica  (IG ii\u00b2  12600a),  and  internally  on  a  marble  base inscribed  with  the  artist's  name  (I.Side 1  (C 3e)). Ps.-Skylax 101  and  Steph.  Byz. 565.10  place  Side  in Pamphylia.  However,  according  to  a  story  concerning  the musician  Stratonikos  (Ath. 350A),  Side  was  not  situated  in Pamphylia,  but,  presumably,  in  Kilikia.  Side  was  probably the  most  important  harbour  in  Pamphylia  (if  that  is  where  it was),  at  least  in  Hellenistic  times,  with  a  large  territory  bor- dering  on  the  territories  of  Aspendos  (no. 1001),  Etenna (Noll\u00e9  ( 1984)),  and  Karallia  (Noll\u00e9  ( 1993)  12\u00ad15).  Bean (( 1979)  47  n. 1)  suggests  a  border  dispute  with  Aspendos, with  whom  relations  were  bad  (Polyb. 5.73.4  (r 218)). Side  was  supposedly  colonised  from  Kyme  (no. 817)  (Ps.- Skylax 101;Arr.  Anab. 1.26.4;Strabo 14.4.2),  possibly  in  C 7l (Martin  ( 2001)  517).  The  foundation  myth  was  that  Side  was 1216 keen  and  fischer-hansen named  after  Side,  the  daughter  of  Tauros  and  wife  of Kimolos;  it  is  reported  by  Steph.  Byz. 565.10\u00ad12,  perhaps quoting  Hekataios  (cf.  Hecat.  fr. 262).The  tradition--found in  Strabo,  Ps.-Skylax  and  Arrian--that S ide  was  a  founda- tion  of  Aiolian  Kyme  probably  has  its  origin  in  the  age  of Alexander  the  Great,  but  there  may  be  a  kernel  of  truth, reflecting early K ymaian  colonisation  in  Pamphylia.  An influx of  C 8\u00adC7  Greek,  possibly  Aiolian,  settlers  at  Side  is conceivable,  given  the  background  of  the  traditions  and  the archaeological  evidence  of  Greek  influence in other Pamphylian  and  Kilikian  cities;  cf.  Aspendos  (no. 1001)  and Soloi  (no. 1011).  However,  the  degree  of  Hellenisation  can- not  be  determined  by  archaeology,  and  no  Archaic  Greek finds are mentioned b y  Mansel  (( 1965)  881)  or  by  Noll\u00e9 (( 1993)  37;  cf.  also  45\u00ad47  for  the  linguistic  evidence). During  the  reign  of  Kroisos,  Side  lay  within  the  Lydian sphere  of  influence (Hdt. 1.28),  but  after  the  fall  of  Lydia  the region  came  under  the  rule  of  Persian  satraps,  and  the  city  is absent  from  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  (historical  survey: Noll\u00e9  ( 1993)  47ff).  According  to tradition,  the  Sidetans  gave up  speaking  their  native  Hellenic  tongue  ( ` , Arr.  Anab. 1.26.4)  and  adopted  a  barbarian  language ( ,Arr.Anab.1.26.4) which was spoken until the late  Hellenistic  period  (C 3  or  C 2).  It  has  a  non-Greek  name (Mansel  in  Mansel  and  Neumann  ( 1975)  171).On  the  Sidetan language  and  Greek\u00adSidetan  bilinguals,  see  Neumann ( 1968);  Brixhe  ( 1969a);  Noll\u00e9  ( 1988). The  Greek  history  of  Side  commenced--or r ecom- menced--in the early H ellenistic  period  with  the  occupa- tion  of  the  city  by  Alexander  the  Great,  and  with  the  growing Hellenisation  reflected,  for  instance,  in  the  Greek-sounding names  of  officials r ecorded  on  C 4  coins  (infra). The  city  had  a  sanctuary  of  Athena  (Strabo  14.4.2),  and the  head  of  this  goddess  is  the  most  common  coin  type (infra),  which  testifies t o  the  importance  of  her  cult  at  Side (cf.  Noll\u00e9  ( 1993)  107\u00ad8).  A  late  source  (ibid. 262.4)  gives Apollo  as  ktistes,  and  Apollo  was  depicted  already  on  C 5 coins  (infra).  The  cults  of  Athena  and  Apollo  undoubtedly took  over  from  indigenous  divinities  (Mansel  ( 1965)  880; Noll\u00e9  ( 1993)  107),  though  Bing  ( 1969)  111  suggests  a  connec- tion  with  Athena  Lindia. The  city  is  situated  on  a  low  coastal  promontory  c. 9  km west  of  the  estuary  of  the  river  Melas.  There  was  direct  access to  a  sandy  bay  which  served  as  the  only--not v ery  conven- ient--harbour of  the  city  (Mansel  ( 1965)  899).  The  city encompassed  the  whole  promontory,  c. 45  ha,  in  Hellenistic and  Roman  times,  but  probably  comprised  only  the  outer- most  peninsula  in  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods. However,  pre-Hellenistic  urban  remains  are  sparse;  the impressive  fortifications go back no earlier than C 2m (Mansel  ( 1965)  881,  897\u00ad99). Side  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Persic  standard  from c. 450/430  to 330;  for  the  mint  within  Persian  suzerainty,  see Noll\u00e9  ( 1993)  49\u00ad50.  The  initial  date  of  minting  has  been  dis- puted,  but  is  now  placed  after  450  (Kraay  ( 1976)  275;  Noll\u00e9 ( 1993)  37,  49;  for  the  coinage  of  Side:  Atlan  ( 1967);  Kraay ( 1969);  Brixhe  ( 1969b)).

Ps.-Skylax  describes  it  as  a  \u00b5;  Diodorus, Ps.-Skylax  and  Alexander  Polyhistor  place  it  in  Kilikia. Alexander  Polyhistor  relates  a  foundation  myth. The  territory  of  Aphrodisias  must  have  comprised  the coastal  lowland  of  the  river  Melas,  later,  with  the  foundation of  Seleukeia,  probably  annexed  by  this  city.  Aphrodisias  is situated  on  the  eastern  side  of  the  isthmus  joining  the promontory  of  Zephyrion  with  its  hinterland,  c. 31  km south-west  of  Seleukeia.  The  city  had  harbours  on  the  west- ern  and  eastern  sides  of  the  peninsula  (Ps.-Skylax  102;  cf. Hellenkemper  and  Hild  ( 1986)  28  n. 12  for  the  suggestion that  the  eastern  harbour  is  the  limen  heteros  of  Holmoi  (no. 1006)).  The  early  remains  are  on  two  hills  to  the  south-west of  the  isthmus  (Bean  and  Mitford  ( 1970)  193\u00ad94  fig. 8). the  south  coast  of  asia  minor  1217 These,  separated  by  a  gully,  were  fortified b y  C 5\u00adC4  walls raised  in  cyclopean  and  in  polygonal  masonry,  strengthened with  square  towers  and  a  curtain-wall.  The  settlement  area on  the  small  plateau  above  the  eastern  harbour  comprised c. 15  ha,  but  no  extant  remains  are  Greek  (TIB 5:  194). A  cult  of  Aphrodite  is  suggested  partly  by  the  name  of  the city  (cf.  the  foundation  myth  (Steph.  Byz. 150.13))  and  part- ly  by  the  evidence  of  the  coin  types  (infra). Aphrodisias  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Aiginetan  standard from  c. 520  (Imhoof-Blumer  ( 1901\u00ad2)  433\u00ad36).

The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is found  internally  on  coinage  (infra),  and  externally  in  Arr. Anab. 2.5.9  (r 333). The  Mallotai  were  supposedly  of  Argos  (no. 347) (Arr.  Anab. 2.5.9;  cf.  Bing  ( 1969)  110).  A  foundation  myth involved  the  Argive  hero  Amphilochos  and  Mopsos  (Strabo 14.5.16;  cf.  supra 1216).  There  was  a  cult  of  Amphilochos  in Mallos  (Arr.  Anab. 2.5.9  (r 333)),  and  his  famous  oracle  in Mallos  is  attested  in  late  sources  (Bosworth  ( 1980)  197).  The Aramaic  coin  legends,  however,  should  be  noted,  and  it  has been  suggested  that  the  name  indicates  a  Phoenician  origin (Triedler  ( 1969)).  Alexander  the  Great  conquered  Mallos  in 333  and  put  an  end  to an  ongoing  stasis  between  the  citizens (Arr.  Anab. 2.5.9).

According  to  local  inhabit- ants,  an  inscription  mentioning  the  city  was  found  in  the vicinity  (AnatSt  ( 1974)  28).  Mallos'  harbour  was  Magarsos (see  supra 1213),and  the  two  cities  became  Antiocheia  on  the Pyramos  during  the  reign  of  Antiochos  IV.

A  silver  coinage  struck  by  local  officials on the P ersian standard  from  c. 400  has  been  attributed  to  Issos  (the  most recent  survey  is  Brindley  ( 1993)).

The  coinage  is  the  only  evidence  for  Hellenisation  in  the Classical  period;  there  is  no  tradition  of  Greek  colonisation, and  Issos  may  well  have  been  a  barbarian  rather  than  a Hellenic  polis. 1008.Kelenderis  Map 66.

Kelenderis  is called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Ps.-Skylax  102.That  it  was a  polis  in  the  political  sense  too  is  indicated  by  its  member- ship  of  the  Delian  League.  At  least,  it  was  assessed  for  tribute in 425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.146),  2  tal. Kelenderis  was  a  Greek  colony  founded  by  Samos  (no. 864)  (Pompon. 1.77  (with  Nagidos);  Hdn. iii.2925.7).  The 1218 keen  and  fischer-hansen Samian  foundation  is  tentatively  dated  before  700  (Shipley ( 1987)  41\u00ad42).  A  cult  of  Hera was  taken  over  from  the metropolis  Samos  (Hdn.  \u00b5.  .  925.7,  Lentz).  C 8l Greek  sherds  from  Tarsos  attest  Greek  presence  in  Kilikia from  this  period  (Braun  ( 1982)  15). Ps.-Skylax 102  places  Kelenderis  in  Kilikia.  It  lay  on  a coastal  promontory,  protecting  the  natural  harbour  below; a  larger  harbour  was  situated  1.6  km  to  the  west.  Strabo  14.5.3 describes  it  as  having  a  \u00b5.  Urban  remains  from  the Greek  history  of  the  site  are  sparse;  some  stretches  of  the  cir- cuit  wall  are  probably  Greek,  though  no  chronology  is offered  (TIB 5:  298).

The  toponym  is ,  (Ps.-Skymnos  fr. 2,  Marcotte),  (Steph.

Dionysopolis  is  implicitly  called  a  polis  in  all  the  sources, in  so  far  as  polis  is  part  of  the  composite  toponym,  but  none is  pre-Hellenistic;  Hellenistic  inscriptions  give  some  polis cognates:  politai  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  13  ter  (C 3))  and  politeia  in  prox- eny  decrees  (infra,C 3).  The  earliest  attestations  of  the  city-ethnic  are  Hellenistic  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  13  bis  (C 3  if  not  C 4l); I.Kallatis 14  (C 3)). Dionysopolis  is  located  at  modern  Balchik;  no  archaeological  remains  are  pre-Roman  (Hind  ( 1983\u00ad84) 74),  but  the  earliest  inscriptions  are  C 4  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  19  bis, 25\u00ad27). Dionysopolis  was  possibly  colonised  by  Miletos  (no. 854), perhaps  not  directly,  but  the  metropolis  is  never  mentioned (cf.  Ehrhardt  ( 1988)  65\u00ad66;  Avram  ( 1996)  294,  298\u00ad99).  The probable  existence  of  the  Ionian  phylai  points  to  a  C 6l\u00adC5 date  for  the  foundation;  there  is  no  proper  foundation myth,  but  the  tradition  about  the  statue  of  Dionysos  may suggest  a  refoundation  in  C 4l. Grants  of  proxeny  are  attested  only  in  C 3  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  13  bis, for  a  citizen  of  Odessos  (no. 689),  and  13  ter,  for  a  citizen  of Kallatis  (no. 686)).  A  citizen  of  Dionysopolis  received  prox- eny  from  Kallatis:  I.Kallatis 14  (C 3). The  seven  phylai  mentioned  in  IGBulg. i\u00b2  15  ter 30 (Roman  period)  \"are  probably  identical  with  the  seven  phy- lai  of  Odessos,  viz.  the  traditional  sixfold  Ionian  division plus  the  later  addition,  the  `Romans'  \"  (Jones,  POAG 276). The  oldest  attested  public  enactments  are  the  two  proxeny decrees  of  C 3  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  13  bis,  which  also  mentions    ,  and 13  ter).  The  eponymous  magistrate was  in  the  Hellenistic  period  the  priest  of  Dionysos  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  22  (C 2)),  but  there  is  no  evidence  for  the  Classical  period. The  earliest  mentions  of  the  boule  and  of  the  assembly (demos)  are  from  C 3  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  13  ter)  and  C 1m  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  13). 685.Istros  (Istrianos) Map  22.

Pol. 1305b5\u00ad6  and,  retrospectively, Diod. 19.73.2  (r 313).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  internally  in  abbreviated  form  on  coins  (infra)  and externally  in  Diod. 19.73.2  (r 313).  The  individual  and  exter- nal  use  is  found  in  IG ii\u00b2  8940;  SEG 24  258  (Athens);  and I.Olbia 7  (all  C 4).Istros  is  called  patra  (  patris)  in  I.Histriae 171  (C 4)  (cf.  CEG ii  882). Istros  was  founded  by  Miletos  (no. 854)  (Hdt. 2.33;  Ps.- Skymnos  fr. 6,  Marcotte)  in  657  (Euseb.  Chron. 95b)  or  some time  later  (Ps.-Skymnos  fr. 6);  archaeological  evidence favours  the  earlier  dating  (Alexandrescu  ( 1978a)  19\u00ad21, ( 1990)  50\u00ad51).Istros  itself  founded  ' \u00b5  north of  the  Dniester  (Arr.  Peripl.M.Eux. 20;Anon.Peripl.M.Eux. 61,  Diller)  and  perhaps  Nikonion  (no. 688),  in  the  same region.  Orgame  (no. 692)  was  probably  also  an  Istrian  foun- dation. Istros  was  perhaps  a  member  of  the  Delian  League, though  there  is  no  positive  evidence.  In  313  it  was  allied  with Kallatis  (no. 686)  against  Lysimachos  (Diod. 19.73.2\u00ad4).  At the  end  of  C 4  an  isopoliteia  with  Miletos  (no. 854)  is  attested (I.Histriae 62).  The  earliest  proxeny  decree  is  from  C 5l/C4e (Avram  ( 1999a));  a  grant  of  proxeny  to a  citizen  of  Istros  is  found  at  Olbia  (no. 690)  in  C 4f(I.Olbia  7  Dubois ( 1996)  19). The  evidence  for  civic  subdivisions  from  the  Late Hellenistic  and  Imperial  period  (four  attested  Milesian  phy- lai)  undoubtedly  indicates  an  earlier  existence:  Aigikoreis (I.Histriae 333  (third  century  ad));  Argadeis  (I.Histriae 334 (third  century  ad));  Boreis  (I.Histriae 97  (C 1),  ? 191  (early first c entury  ad));  Geleontes  (SEG 30  849  (Roman)).  The original  oligarchic  constitution  was  replaced  through  a  stasis  by  a  democratic  regime  (Arist.  Pol. 1305b1\u00ad12),  possibly as  a  consequence  of  Perikles'  expedition  in  the  Black  Sea  and  the  progress  of  Athenian  influence (Plut.  Per. 20;  cf. Alexandrescu  ( 1990)  70\u00ad74). Several  officials are attested in the H ellenistic  period,  but their  Milesian  origin  indicates  an  earlier  existence.  The eponymous  official was the priest of  Apollo  Ietros  (implicit- ly  I.Histriae 169  (C 4e),  144  (C 4)),  attested  explicitly  only from  C 1s  (I.Histriae 54)  onwards. Istros  is  located  near  the  village  of  Istria,  Romania.  The acropolis  (with  the  temenos),  an  Archaic  city  wall  (C 6s, destroyed  at  the  end  of  C 6)  and  a  Classical  city  wall  (C 5\u00adC4, possibly  destroyed  by  Lysimachos  in  313;  cf.  Diod. 19.73.4) have  been  identified through e xcavations.  The  early  city walls  enclosed  an  area  of 60  ha  distributed  between  the temenos  on  the  acropolis  and  the  civil  settlement  on  the  west side  of  the  city  (Alexandrescu  ( 1978b),  ( 1990)  51\u00ad52;Dupont et al.( 1999)). Local  inscriptions  mention  the  agora  (from  C 3f  onwards: I.Histriae 1,  3,  8,  etc.).  The  sanctuary  of  Apollo  Ietros  is attested  only  from  C 3f  onwards  (I.Histriae 6,  65,  etc.),  but  it may  originate  in  C 6.  For  the  temple  of  Zeus  Polieus  with altar  (I.Histriae 8  (C 3))  and  the  temple  of  Aphrodite  there  is  archaeological  evidence  from  C 6m  (Pippidi  ( 1962); Zimmermann  ( 1981);  Alexandrescu  ( 1990)  56\u00ad57).A  theatre is  mentioned  in  C 3f(I.Histriae  65). The  main  attested  cults  are  those  of  Zeus  Polieus (I.Histriae 8  (C 3),  etc.),  Apollo  Ietros  (I.Histriae 169  (C 4e), 314A  (C 4),  104,  144  (C 4\u00adC3),  etc.;  cf.  Apollo   I.Histriae 105  (C 3));  Leto  (I.Histriae 170  (C 4));  Aphrodite (I.Histriae 101  (C 6m),  108  (C 4),  113  (C 3),  etc.).  The  festivals of  Thargelia  (I.Histriae 65  (C 3f))  and  Taurea  (I.Histriae 60 (C 2);  cf. 61  (C 2))  are  also  attested  in  the  Hellenistic  period but  they  might  be  very  old.  The  early  Milesian  calendar  is suggested  by  the  mention  of  the  months  Taureon  (I.Histriae 26;  cf.  the  festival  of  Taurea),  Thargelion  (cf.  the  festival  of  Thargelia),  Anthesterion  (I.Histriae 58  (C 2))  and Artemeision  (I.Histriae 54  (C 1))  (Tr\u00fcmpy,  Monat. 89). Istros  struck  coins  from  c. 480  onwards.  Its  earliest  coins are  silver  drachms;  later  denominations  are  trihemiobols and  obols.

Avram  ( 1991)  106).  The  city-ethnic  is  (C 4 coins,  infra;Arr.  Anab. 6.23.5  (r 325/4))  or   (Diod. 19.73.1,  4\u00ad6,  20.25.1,  in  all  passages  in  the  plural). In  Ps.-Skylax 67  Kallatis  is  the  fourth  toponym  listed  after the  heading   `   (cf.  Diod. 19.73.5 (r 313));  politai  and  politeia  occur  in  proxeny  decrees  passim from  C 4l  onwards.  It  is  called  by  Ps.-Skymnos  fr. 4, Marcotte,  and  described  as  by Strabo 7.6.1. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  abbreviated  form  on  coins  (infra)  and  in  C 3  inscriptions (SGDI 3089  I.Kallatis 7,  etc.)  and  externally  in  Diod. 19.73.4\u00ad6  (r 313).  The  individual  and  external  use  is  found  in Arr.  Anab. 6.23.5  (r 325/4);  I.Sinope 3  (Sinope  (C 4));  and  CIG 3317  I.Smyrna 147  (C 4\u00adC3).  It is  called  patra  (  patris)  in CEG ii  731  I.Kallatis 130  (C 4). Kallatis  was  colonised  by  Herakleia  (no. 715):  Ps.- Skymnos  fr. 4,  Marcotte;  cf.  Strabo  7.6.1;  Memnon  (FGrHist 434)  fr. 13  ( 21),etc.Pompon.2.2.22  (Milesiis  deducta  Callatis) must  be  a  mistake.  The  dating  depends  on  the  identification of  Amyntas  (I  or  III),  to  whom  the  source  of  Ps.-Skymnos (Demetrios  of  Kallatis)  refers.  It  is  possible  that  Demetrios of  Kallatis  had  Amyntas  I  (c. 540\u00ad498)  in  mind,  so  that Kallatis  may  have  been  founded  at  the  end  of  C 6.But  for  this early  dating  there  is  no  archaeological  evidence  (Hind ( 1992\u00ad93)  89). Kallatis  was  probably  a  member  of  the  Delian  League, although  in  the  assessment  decree  of 425/4  the  attractive restoration  [ ] is not certain (Pippidi (1971) 63\u00ad64  SEG 22  9  versus [] in IG  i\u00b3  71.iv.165). Around 313  Kallatis  led  a  symmachia  with  Istros  (no. 685) and  other  west  Pontic  cities  against  Lysimachos  (Diod. 19.73.2\u00ad4).  After  the  conquest  of  Kallatis  by  Lysimachos, refugees  from  Kallatis  were  settled  by  the  Bosporan  king Eumelos  in  :Diod.  20.25.1. The  first attested g rant  of  proxeny  is  from  c. 311/10 (I.Kallatis 2),  while  the  first known r eceived  proxeny  is  presumably  by Sinope  (no. 729)  in  C 4  (I.Sinope 3,  which  is probably  a  grant  of  proxeny  and  other  privileges,  though  the fragmentary  text  preserves  only  a  grant  of  citizenship).  The oldest  attested  public  enactment  is  the  proxeny  decree  from c. 311/10,  and  the  same  inscription  also  records  the  boula. The  eponymous  official was,  as  in  Megara  (no. 225),  the basileus,  attested  from  C 3  onwards:  I.Kallatis 3;  SGDI 3089  I.Kallatis 7,  etc.  The  same  inscriptions  as  well  as I.Kallatis 4  mention  probouloi  for  each  month.  The  president  of  the  assembly  was  the  proaisymnon  (pr(o)aisim- non):  Avram  ( 1994)  170\u00ad75  (from  C 3  onwards).  More officials are mentioned in H ellenistic  inscriptions. Kallatis  is  located  at  modern  Mangalia  (Romania).  The earliest  ceramic  finds are C 4e.  Some  public  buildings  attest- ed  through  Hellenistic  inscriptions  could  be  older:  a  bouleu- terion  (I.Kallatis 49  (C 2)),  a  prytaneion  (I.Kallatis 3;  SGDI 3089  I.Kallatis 7  (C 3)),  a  theatre  (I.Kallatis 3  (C 3)).  The earliest  city  wall  was  erected  in  C 4f  (Preda  ( 1968)  22  and recent  unpublished  excavations);  its  existence  is  also  suggested  by  Diod. 19.73  and 20.25.1  (r 313/12  and 309\u00ad307?), the  two  sieges  under  Lysimachos. The  evidence  for  cults  is  mostly  Hellenistic,  but  in  some cases  one  may  suspect  an  early  Megarian  origin.  Attested patron  deities  are  Zeus  Polieus  (I.Kallatis 22),  Zeus  Soter (I.Kallatis 254  (C 4e))  and  Athena  Polias  (I.Kallatis 76  (C 4)). A  typical  communal  cult  of  Megarian  origin  is  that  of Dionysos  Patroos  and  Dasyllios,  attested  through  a  list  of deities  from  C 4  (I.Kallatis 48A).  The  same  list  also  mentions Aphrodite  Pandamos,  Peitho,  Kronos  and  (Damater) Chthonia.  Among  the  attested  festivals,  the  Dionysia  (I.Kallatis 3  (C 3))  may  be  of  earlier  origin.  Eight attested  months  from  the  local  calendar  indicate  a  Megarian origin  (Avram  ( 1999b),  complete  restoration  of  the  calen- dar).  Evidence  for  oracle  consultation  is  first g iven  by Ps.- Skymnos  fr. 4,  referring  to the  foundation  of  Kallatis   \u00b5  (the  oracle  of  Delphi),  and  by a  series  of  oracular inscriptions  from  C 4\u00adC2  (I.Kallatis 48\u00ad50). Kallatis  struck  silver  coins  from  C 4s  onwards;  the  earliest coins  are  drachms  and  hemidrachms.  Obv.  head  of  young Herakles  r.  in  lion  skin;  rev.  corn-ear,  club  and  bow-case;  leg- end: or .  Possibly  also  some  types  of bronze  coinage  (Pick  ( 1898)  nos. 196\u00ad204;Head,  HN \u00b2 273\u00ad74;Price ( 1993)  pl.  VII  nos. 203\u00ad4).

Mesambria  is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  at  Hdt. 4.93.1,  and  in  Ps.-Skylax  67  Mesambria  is  the  second toponym  listed  under  the  heading   ` . Polis  in  the  political  sense  is  attested  at  Hdt. 6.33.2,  as  well  as in  local  inscriptions  of  C 3f  (e.g.  IGBulg. i\u00b2  307).The  cognates politai  and  politeia  occur  in  the  local  proxeny  decrees  (infra). The  city  is  also  poetically  called  patris  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  345).  It  is described  as  by Strabo 7.6.1  and  as  \u00b5  by  Eust. 803  (GGM ii  356\u00ad57). The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  found  internally  in abbreviated  form  on  C 5  coins  (supra)  and  in  inscriptions  of C 3  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  307,  309,  317)  and  externally  in  Polyb. 25.2.14 and  IGBulg. i\u00b2  388  bis  (C 2).  The  external  individual  use  is found  in  IG ii\u00b2  9338  (C 4m)  and  Syll. \u00b3219  IOSPE i\u00b2  20 (Olbia,  C 4f). Mesambria  is  located  at  modern  Nesebar (\"a classical peninsula  site\":  Hind  ( 1983\u00ad84)  73).  \"For  the  classical  peri- od,  an  estimate  of  the  population  of  Mesambria  has  been made  at  3,000\u00ad4,000  inhabitants  (of  whom  about  700\u00ad800 might  be  hoplites),  disposing  of  a  city  area  of  about  300  ha, and  with  a  capability  of  launching  up  to  50  ships\"  (ibid. 74); but  cf.  Hind  ( 1992\u00ad93)  86:  \"revised  estimates  of  the  size  of the  ancient  city  suggest  that  to  the  present  peninsula  should be  added  areas  to  the  north  and  the  south  now  under  water, giving  an  area  of  some  40  hectares\". Mesambria  was  colonised  by  Kalchedon  (no. 743)  and Megara  (no. 225)  at  the  time  of  Dareios'  campaign  against  the Skythians  (c. 513/12:  Ps.-Skymnos  739\u00ad42,  Diller;  cf.  Anon. Peripl.M.Eux. 83\u00ad84,  Diller)  or  by refugees  from  Kalchedon (no. 743)  and  Byzantion  (no. 674):  Hdt. 4.93  (Mesambria mentioned  as  toponym  while  relating  the  campaign  of Dareios)  and  6.33  (about  its  \"foundation\",  which  would  fall  in 493);  cf.  Eust. 803  (GGM ii  356\u00ad57).  The  first dating (C 6l)  is more  likely  to  be  correct  (Ehrhardt  ( 1987)  92;  Avram  ( 1996) 290\u00ad92).Mena  as  is  recorded  by  the  source  of  Strabo 7.6.1  in  an  attempt  to  explain  the  etymology  of  the  name  (cf. Plin.  HN 4.11.45).  See  also  the  epigram  IGBulg. i\u00b2  345.4: \u00b5(sic) \u00b5(sic)   [ ]    , bria  being  the  Thracian  word  for  polis  (Steph.  Byz. 446.15\u00ad16, citing  Nic.  Dam.;  Strabo  7.6.1;  IGBulg. i\u00b2  345  comm.). Mesambria  founded  Naulochos  (modern  Obzor,  north of Nesebar) at an unknown date: Strabo  7.6.1: \u00b5 (cf.9.5.19;Plin.HN4.11.45).Ps.- Skymnos  (fr. 3,  Marcotte)  reports  a  tradition  that Mesambria  founded  Bizone  (no. 683),  but  since  Bizone  does not  appear  to  be  Dorian,  the  tradition  is  questionable. Mesambria  probably  joined  the  Delian  League--at least, it  was  probably  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iv.161, where [----] may r efer  to Mesambria).  In C 4  it  had,  per- haps  as  subordinate,  treaties  with  some  Thracian  kings: IGBulg. i\u00b2  307  v  5086  (rC 3f).  In 313  it  was  probably  allied with  Kallatis  (no. 686),Istros  (no. 685)  and  other  west  Pontic cities  against  Lysimachos  (cf.  Diod. 19.73). Citizens  of  Mesambria  received  proxenies  from  Olbia (no. 690)  (Syll. \u00b3219  IOSPE i\u00b2  20  Dubois  ( 1996)  15 (c. 375\u00ad350))  and  Oropos  (no. 214)  (IG vii  281  I.Oropos 50 (C 3s)).  The  proxeny  decree  and  the  treaty  concluded  with the  Thracian  king  Sadalas  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  307  (C 3f))  are  the  earliest  attested  public  enactments.  The  eponymous  official was,  as  in  Megara  (no. 225),  the  basileus  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  322  bis (C 3)). Evidence  for  public  architecture  is  also  Hellenistic,  but the  theatre  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  307,308  bis, 308  ter  (C 3))  and  the  sanc- tuaries  of  Apollo  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  307,  307  bis, 308  bis  (C 3),  etc.) and  Dionysos  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  308  ter  (C 3))  may  be  earlier  than their  first attestation. For  the  city  walls  (C 5  or  C 4e)  (pseudo-isodomic  and  isodomic  work)  there  is  only  scanty  archaeological  evidence,  since  they  were  destroyed  by  the  construction  of  the  late  Roman  and  Byzantine  citadel  (Velkov  ( 1969) 31\u00ad37). Some  of  the  cults  attested  in  Mesambria  in  the  Hellenistic period  are  certainly  or  possibly  of  Megarian  origin  and  so ought  to  be  early:  Zeus  Hyperdexios  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  322  bis  (C 3)) and  Athena  Soteira  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  326  (C 1))  as  patron  deities, Apollo  (supra,  about  his  sanctuary),  Dionysos  (sanctuary: IGBulg. i\u00b2  308  ter  (C 3);  Eleuthereus:  IGBulg. i\u00b2  324  (C 1);  fes- tival  of  the  Dionysia:  IGBulg. i\u00b2  307,  308  bis, 308  ter  (C 3)), (Damater)  Malophoros  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  370  bis  (Imperial  peri- od)),  the  Dioskouroi  (festival  of  the  Dioskouria:  IGBulg. i\u00b2 308  septies  (C 3)),  etc. Mesambria  struck  coins  from  C 5m  onwards.  The  earliest coins  are  silver  drachms.  Types:  obv.  crested  Corinthian  hel- met  facing  or  head  of  Athena;  rev.  incuse  square;  legend: in  a  spoked  wheel  (Head,  HN \u00b2278\u00ad79;Price ( 1993) pl.

Pol. 1303a26  and 36\u00ad37,  where  Apollonia  is one  of  eight  examples  subsumed  under  the  heading  polis. Strabo  7.6.1  retrospectively  describes  it  as  and \u00b5. The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally in  abbreviated  form  on  C 5s  coins  (infra)  and  externally  at Aen.  Tact. 20.4  and  Arist.  Pol. 1303a36\u00ad37  (cf.  the  inscription from  Pistiros  (Vetren)  SEG 43  486.32  (C 4s)).  The  external and  individual  use  is  found  in  an  inscription  from  Vetren (IGBulg .  iii.1  1068  (C 4\u00adC3))  and  in  later  documents. Apollonia  is  located  at  modern  Sozopol  (Bulgaria),  par- tially  on  a  peninsula  (cf.  Hind  ( 1983\u00ad84)  fig. 3).  The  earliest archaeological  finds are of  C 7l  (ibid. 72;  Panayotova  ( 1998) 97;  for  the  earliest  finds in the c emetery,  see  T.  Ivanov  in  I.  Venedikov  et al.( 1963)  nos. 780\u00ad81;  cf.  for  new  material (Wild  Goat  style  and  related  East  Greek  pottery)  Reho ( 1986)).  The  earliest  stone  inscription  is  C 6:  IGBulg. i\u00b2  404. For  some  rural  settlements,  see  Hind  ( 1992\u00ad93)  85. Apollonia  was  colonised  by  Miletos  (no. 854)  50  years before  the  reign  of  Kyros  (i.e.  c. 610):  Ps.-Skymnos  730\u00ad33;  cf. Anon.  Peripl.M.Eux. 85\u00ad86,  Diller.  The  possibility  that Rhodians  joined  the  Milesians  in  founding  Apollonia (Steph.  Byz. 160.2)  is  to  be  rejected.  According  to  Ael.  VH 3.17,  the  founder  was  Anaximander  the  philosopher,  but Anaximander  was  64  years  old  in  Ol. 58.2  (i.e. 547;  cf.  Diog. Laert. 2.2),  so  he  was  born  c. 611  and  he  can  hardly  have  been the  oikistes  of  Apollonia  if  we  accept  the  traditional  dating (strongly  supported  by the  archaeological  evidence).  Steph. Byz. 96.2\u00ad4  also  mentions         ,       ,   \u00b5\u00b5     (cf.  Plin.  HN 4.11.45:  Astice regio  habuit  oppidum  Anthium;  nunc  est  Apollonia).  It  might have  been  a  minor  Milesian  foundation  identified w ith  a settlement  on  the  Atiya  peninsula  (Antheia  &gt; A tiya)  which produced  early  Greek  material  (Hind  ( 1983\u00ad84)  73).  See  also  the  astakos  (crayfish) symbol on C 5m\u00adC4  coins  of Apollonia,  which  may  be  a  pun  on  the  region,  Astike  (Hind ( 1985a)). Apollonia  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League;  at  least,  it was  assessed  for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iv.128).  Athenian influence is attested in the calendar,  which  includes  the specifically A thenian  month  Mounychion  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  469 bis),  dated  C 3\u00adC2  but  perhaps  introduced  in  C 5  (Tr\u00fcmpy, Monat. 91).  In  341  Apollonia  had  a  treaty  with  Philip  II  of Makedon  (Just.  Epit. 9.2.1),  perhaps  in  a  subordinate  posi- tion,  and  in  313  it  probably  joined  the  alliance  with  Kallatis (no. 686),Istros  (no. 685)  and  other  west  Pontic  cities  against Lysimachos  (Diod. 19.73). Apollonia  originally  (C 6)  had  an  oligarchic  constitution; cf.  Arist.  Pol. 1305b39\u00ad1306a6\u00ad9,  where  a  stasis  is  mentioned in  a  discussion  of  how  oligarchies  change.  At  Pol. 1303a36\u00ad38  Aristotle  mentions  that  \"the  people  of  Apollonia on  the  Euxine  Sea  after  bringing  in  additional  settlers ( )fellintofaction(  )\".  These  refer- ences  probably  refer  to  two  different  moments:  the  affair  of the  epoikoi  suggests  an  Archaic  context,  close  to  the  foun- dation,  while  the  change  in  oligarchy  seems  to  indicate rather  elaborate  institutions  (Danov  ( 1976)  210;Gehrke, Stasis 24,  255). An  extra-urban  sanctuary  of  Apollo  Ietros  on  St  Cyriacus (Svet  Kirik)  island  (known  from  Hellenistic  inscriptions)  is indirectly  attested  for  C 5,  in  so  far  as  the  statue  of  Apollo captured  in  72  by  the  Romans  (Plin.  HN 4.13,  34.7;App.  Ill. 30)  was  a  work  of  Kalamis  (Strabo  7.6.1),  whose  activity falls c. 475\u00ad450.  The  sanctuary  is  surely  as  old  as  the  city  itself.  In C 5\u00adC4  a  megaron  of  Ge  Chthonia  is  also  mentioned  (IGBulg. i\u00b2  398).  Other  attested  cults  are  those  of  Artemis  Pytheia  of Milesian  origin  (graffito in SEG 3557  (C 6))  and  Aphrodite (Archaic  terracottas;  cf.  Hoddinott  ( 1975)  38). Aen.  Tact. 20.4  refers  to pylai  at  Apollonia  in  C 4m  and thus  to  the  existence  of  fortification walls.  The  two  harbours are  attested  only  in  the  Hellenistic  period. the  black  sea  area  931 Apollonia  struck  silver  coins  on  the  Attic  standard  from C 5m  onwards.

A  possible  further  mention  rC 4  depends  on  acceptance  of  the conjecture  suggested  by  Iliescu  ( 1969),  ( 1971)  apud  Clem.  Al. Strom. 5.5  p. 240:  \u00b5  instead  of  \u00b5  (contra  Pippidi  ( 1984)  153  n. 12). Bizone  is  called  a  polichnion  by Anon.  Peripl.M.Eux. 75  Ps.-Skymnos  fr. 3.  However,  it  was  a  C 6  colony  (infra) and  presumably  founded  as  a  polis.  The  territory of  Bizone  is called  chora  in  an  external  inscription  (Istros:  I.Histriae 15.26  (C 3l)).In  the  neighbouring  area  \u00b5   are attested  (Ps.-Skymnos  fr. 2b,  Marcotte),  i.e.  Greeks, (Thracian)  Krobyzians  and  Skythians.  The  city  was destroyed  by  an  earthquake  (Strabo  1.3.10,  7.6.1;Pompon. 2.2.22;  Plin.  HN 4.11.44)  in  C 1s  and  then  refounded  in  the Imperial  period. Bizone  is  located  at  modern  Kavarna  (Bulgaria), Chirakman  promontory.  A  few  archaeological  remains  date to  the  beginning  of  C 6  (East  Greek  banded  ware:  Salkin ( 1986)),  but  the  bulk  of  the  pottery  is  of  late  C 5  to C 3  (Hind ( 1992\u00ad93)  87).  Hence,  Bizone  was  colonised  possibly  in  C 6. Although  Ps.-Skymnos  fr. 3  knew  a  tradition  that  it  was founded  by  a  barbarian  people,  whereas  according  to  anoth- er  it  was  a  colony  of  Mesambria  (no. 687),both  traditions  are suspect:  the  Greek  character  of  the  city  is  beyond  doubt,  but the  few  later  inscriptions  do  not  confirm that the city was Dorian.  Rather,  Bizone  was  founded  by  Miletos  (no. 854)  or by  one  of  the  west  Pontic  Milesian  colonies. 684. ", "Nikonion": "Identifier: 689. , Map 23.  Lat. 26.10,long.  30.25.

Nikonion  was  colonised  in  C 6l  directly  by  Miletos  (no. 854)  or,  more  probably,  by  Istros  (no. 685);  cf.  the  numis- matic  evidence  and  the  role  of  Istros  in  refounding Nikonion  (Y.  G.  Vinogradov  ( 1999)).  Nikonion  was  under the  protectorate  of  the  Skythian  king  Skyles  (C 5m,  infra) and  then  joined  the  Delian  League;  at  least,  it  was  assessed for  tribute  in  425/4  (IG i\u00b3  71.iv.167: [] or rather [  ];  cf.  Avram  ( 1995)  197).  C. 331  it  was  destroyed  by Zopyrion  (Y.  G.  Vinogradov  ( 1997)  323)  and  then  refounded (C 3f)  by  Tyras  (no. 694)  with  the  support  of  Istros  (Y.  G.  Vinogradov  ( 1999)). Nikonion  is  located  at  modern  Roksolanskoye gorodishche  (Ukraine),  on  the  left  bank  of  the  estuary  of  the Dniester.  The  site  had  a  defensive  wall,  uncovered  in  the north-western  part  of  the  upper  terrace  (c. 475\u00ad450).  No inscriptions  on  stone  have  been  found,  while  ceramic  mate- rial  (including  graffiti) suggests the floruit  of  the  site  in C 6l\u00adC5  (Sekerskaya  ( 1989);  Zaginajlo  and  Sekerskaya ( 1997)).  Some  of  the  minor  settlements  identified in the lower  Dniester  River  region  (Okhotnikov  ( 1990))  may belong  to  the  territory  of  Nikonion.

G.  Vinogradov  ( 1997)  35,  209).  On  the  other  hand, their  legend  indicates  that  the  Skythian  king  Skyles  exer- cised  a  protectorate  over  Nikonion.  In  addition  to  its  own issues,  Nikonion  regularly  used  Istrian  silver  and  bronze coins  (Karyshkovskij  ( 1966);  Preda  ( 1973)  33). 689.

The  toponym  is ,  (Thuc. 4.107.3;schol.Thuc.5.6.1;Ps.-Skylax  67), said  to derive  from  Galepsos,  son  of  Thasos  and  Telephe (Marsyas  the  Younger  (FGrH 136)  fr. 5).  The  city-ethnic  is (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.15).  In Ps.-Skylax  67  Galepsos  is  the third  of  four  toponyms  listed  after  the  heading   ` ,where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense.  For polis  used  in  the  political  sense,  see  Diod. 12.68.4  (rC 5s).  The collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists (infra).  For  the  individual  and  external  use,  see  an  undated Athenian  funerary  inscription  (SEG 32  297;  cf.  no. 571). Galepsos  was  a  colony  (apoikia)  of  Thasos  (Thuc. 4.107.3, 5.6.1;  Heraclid.  Pont.  fr. 125,Wehrli;  Diod. 12.68.4).  Qualified as  a   `  and  one  of  the  emporia  of  the  Thasians by  Ps.-Skylax 67,  it  is  generally  considered  as  one  of  the mainland emporia of Thasos  (Avram  ( 1995)  193: \"Urspr\u00fcnglich  bloss  einem  Emporion  der  Thasier\")  or rather  a  dependent  polis  and  an  emporion  in  the  mainland peraia  of  Thasos  (Hansen  ( 1997)  88,(2000)  199). Galepsos  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Thracian  district  and  is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.iv.15)  to  415/14  (IG i\u00b3  290.iii.21,  heavily restored)  a  total  of  fourteen  times,  paying  first c. 1\u0153  tal.  (IG i\u00b3 259.iv.15)  reduced  to  3,000  dr.  in  443/2  (IG i\u00b3  269.iii.3)  and further  reduced  to  1,000  dr.  in  433/2  (IG i\u00b3  279.ii.35).  After the  fall  of  Amphipolis  in  424,  Galepsos  was  won  over  by Brasidas  with  the  assistance  of  the  Makedonian  king Perdikkas  (Thuc. 4.107.3),  but  was  recaptured  by  Kleon  two years  later  (Thuc. 5.6.1).  It  was  conquered  and  destroyed  by Philip  II  (Strabo  7  fr. 35),presumably  soon  before  or  after  his capture  of  Krenides  in  356  (Hammond  and  Griffith ( 1979) 363);  however,  it  was  probably  refounded  by the Makedonians,  as  inferred  by the  mention  of  Galepsos  in Livy  ( 44.45.14\u00ad15  (rC 2f)),  drawing  on  Polybios. Galepsos  is  generally  identified w ith  the  ruins  at Ga\u00efdourokastro,  a C 5e  fortified citadel,  strategically  located south  of  the  village  of  Karyani  ( 7\u00ad8  km  south-west  of Orfano),  which  dominates  both  the  Strymonic  Gulf  and  the Pierian  coast  (Collart  ( 1937)  78\u00ad80,  following  Perdrizet ( 1894)  440;  detailed  description  of  the  site  in  Bakalakis  and Mylonas  ( 1938);  plan  of  the  citadel  in  Lazaridis  ( 1971)  fig. 64).  The  earliest  finds are dated t o  C 7l  and  C 6e (Romiopoulou  ( 1960)),  indicating  its  foundation  as  a Thasian  colony  as  early  as  C 7l,  possibly  on  the  site  of  a  pre- existing  Thracian  settlement.  A  C 6\u00adC4  cemetery,  including both  inhumation  and  cremation  burials,  was  excavated  on  a low  hill,  south-west  of  the  citadel,  some  200  m  from  the coast  (Koukouli-Chryssanthaki  ( 1972c)  526\u00ad27).  The  exist- ence  of  a  sanctuary  of  Zeus,  worshipped  with  the  epithets herkeios,  patroios  and  ktesios,  is  assumed  from  the  discovery of  two  C 5l\u00adC4e  boundary  stones  with  characteristic Parian/Thasian  lettering  (Collart  ( 1937)  79,n.  4,  with  refs.). Moreover,  the  urban  centre  at  Ga\u00efdourokastron  may  be related  to  the  neighbouring  coastal  settlement  identified  1 km  to  the  east,  on  the  Pithari  hill,  which  is  probably  linked  to the  C 6  tombs  excavated  in  the  vicinity,  and  with  an  unlocat- ed  sanctuary  of  Demeter  with  a  hekatompedos  temple,  men- tioned  on  four  inscribed  boundary  stones  found  at  the  foot of  the  hill  (unpublished;  cf.  Koukouli-Chryssanthaki  ( 1982) 325\u00ad26;  BE  ( 1994)  no. 433). Galepsos  struck  bronze  coins,  probably  in  C 4e,  but  so  far only  three  pieces  are  known  (Bon  and  Bon  ( 1936);  BCH ( 1930);  cf.

The  city-ethnic  is thrace  from  strymon  to  nestos  861 (Artem.  fr. 15,  GGM i476).  Krenides  is  called  a polis  in  late  sources  only  (Diod. 16.8.6  (r 361)),but  polis  status in  C 4  is  strongly  indicated  by  its  mint  (infra).  The  legend  on the  coins  shows  that  the  polis  was  a  Thasian  dependency (infra).  In  C 1  it  had  dwindled  to  a   \u00b5  (Strabo 7  fr. 41). Krenides  is  said  to  have  drawn  its  name  from  springs  ris- ing  near  the  foot  of  its  acropolis  (App.  B  Civ. 4.105;Strabo 7 fr. 34;  cf.  Collart  ( 1937)  39ff).It  was  colonised  by  the  Thasians c. 360/59  (Diod. 16.3.7).  That  the  exiled  Athenian  Kallistratos was  involved  in  the  colonisation  is  argued  by  some  histor- ians  (Hammond  and  Griffith ( 1979)  187\u00ad88,235;Vatin  ( 1984) 267\u00ad68),  but  has  no  foundation  in  the  sources  (see  supra). Krenides  was  located  near  Mt.  Pangaion,  possessing  numer- ous  gold  mines,  where  the  city  of  Philippoi  was  eventually established  (Strab. 7  fr. 34;Artem.fr.  15;Diod.  16.3.7). Threatened  by  Thracian  attacks,  it  requested  aid  from  Philip II,  who  occupied  and  fortified it ( 356),  introducing  new Makedonian  settlers  and  renaming  it  Philippoi  (Artem.  fr. 15;Diod.  16.3.7,  8.6;  Steph.

In  Ps.- Skylax 67,  Phagres  is  the  second  of  four  toponyms  listed after  the  heading   ` ,  where polis  is used  in  the  urban  sense.  In  Hdt. 7.112.2  it  is  described, together  with  Pergamon,  as  a  teichos  of  the  Pieres  (Hdt. 7.112),  whereas  Thuc. 2.99.3  calls  Phagres  a  chorion.  That Phagres  was  a  polis  in  the  political  sense  is  indicated  by  its mint  (infra)  and  by  the  recording  of  its  city-ethnic  in  a Delphic  catalogue  of  communities  which  seem  to  have  been either  poleis  or  islands  with  more  than  one  polis  (F.Delphes iii.1497.4  (C 4l\u00adC3e)).  The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is attested  internally  in  abbreviated  form  on  coins  (infra)  and externally  in  the  Delphic  catalogue  (supra).  The  individual and  external  use  is  attested  on  a  C 4  funerary  stele  from Eleutheropolis  (SEG 38  656). Phagres  was  one  of  the   `in Thrace,list- ed  between  Amphipolis  and  Galepsos  by  Ps.-Skylax  67  and further  described  as  a  Thasian  emporion.  From  the  time  of Philip  II  and  Alexander  III  it  was  part  of  Makedonia  (Strabo 7  fr. 33).  Phagres  is  said  to  have  been  settled  by  Pieres expelled  from  the  Makedonian  Pieria  under  Perdikkas  I  east of  the  mouth  of  the  river  Strymon,  at  the  westernmost  end of  the  Pierian  coast  (Thuc. 2.99.3).It  must  have  been  strong- ly  fortified,  as  indicated  by  its  classification as a teichos  in Hdt. 7.112.2.  At  an  unknown  date  in  C 6(?),  Phagres  was  pre- sumably  colonised  by  the  Thasians  and  incorporated  in their  mainland  peraia.  Together  with  Galepsos  and Apollonia,  Phagres  may  have  been  one  of  the  poleis  occupied and  destroyed  by  Philip  II  after  his  capture  of  Amphipolis (Strabo  7  fr. 35;  cf.  Dem. 9.26). The  urban  centre  was  tentatively  located  on  a  hill (Kanoni)  rich  in  ancient  remains  east  of  the  village  of Orphanion,  c. 8  km  to the  east  of  the  mouth  of  the  Strymon (Leake  ( 1835)  iii. 176ff),  followed  by  Perdrizet  ( 1894)  440  and Collart  ( 1937)  76ff;  cf.  BE  ( 1990)  no. 491).  Recent  excavations on  the  site  revealed  abundant  C 6s\u00adC5e  good-quality  Attic and  Thasian  pottery,  which  was  collected  from  a  group  of circular  pits  and  was  interpreted  as  remains  from  a  destruc- tion  suffered  by  the  city  in  C 5f  (Nikolaidou-Patera  ( 1989) 490).Archaeological  remains,  including  a  Hellenistic  build- ing  and  a  cemetery  of  Hellenistic  date  (C 3l\u00adC2e)  located  to the  north-west  of  the  hill,  indicate  the  survival  of  the  settle- ment  probably  down to the  Roman  period  (Nikolaidou- Patera ( 1987),  ( 1989)  489\u00ad91,(1990)  517\u00ad21,(1996)).

Apollonia  was  located  on  the  Pierian  coast  between Galepsos  and  Oisyme,  on  the  cape  enclosing  the  Strymonic Gulf  from  the  east,  opposite  Mt.  Athos  (Strabo  7  fr. 33;  Plin.

Together  with Galepsos,  it  was  conquered  and  destroyed  by  Philip  II (Strabo  7  fr. 35E;  Dem. 9.26),  presumably  following  the  cap- ture  of  Krenides  in  356  (Hammond  and  Griffith ( 1979)  363).

In  Strabo  7  fr. 36  it  is  called  a  kome  in  Bisaltia.  The site-classification as a polis  in  the  Classical  period  is  corrob- orated  (a)  by  the  appearance  of  Berga  in  the  tribute  lists  as  a paying  member  of  the  Delian  League  (infra);  (b)  by  the  C 5 coins;  and  (c)  by  the  listing  of  Antiphanes  Bergaios  (proba- bly  the  famous  C 4  author  of  Apista)  among  the  theorodokoi to  host  theoroi  from  Epidauros  (IG iv\u00b2.194.19).

It  is  now identified beyond r easonable  doubt  with  the  remains  of  an important  urban  centre  by  Neos  Skopos,  close  to  the  eastern bank  of  the  now  drained  Lake  Achinos  (ancient  Kerkinitis) in  the  lower  Strymon  basin  (Bonias  ( 2000)  236  n. 28; Koukouli-Chryssanthaki  ( 2000)  359\u00ad61,  recording  imported Ionic  and  Attic  pottery  of  C 6  and  C 5  date,  C 5  and  C 4  Attic sculpture,  and  various  finds indicative of  strong  Thasian  and Attic  influence).  On  the  remnants  of  the  defence  circuit-- now  destroyed--see Samsaris ( 1976)  133.  The  use  of  the Parian\u00adThasian  alphabet  in  the  new  C 5f  inscription  from Neos  Skopos  (Bonias  ( 2000))  strongly  supports  the  view  that Berga  was  established  as  a  dependent  colony  and,  probably, emporion  of  Thasos  providing  access  to commercial  routes and  Thracian  resources  through  the  Strymon  and  the Angites  valleys.  In  463,following  the  suppression  of  its  seces- sion  from  the  Delian  League,  Thasos  must  have  lost  control of  Berga  along  with  the  rest  of  its  mainland  possessions. Consequently,  the  Bergaians  became  members  of  the Delian  League.  Berga  belonged  to  the  Thracian  district  and is  recorded  in  the  tribute  lists  from  451  (IG i\u00b3  261.iv.29)  to 429/8  (IG i\u00b3  282.ii.32)  a  total  of  seven  times.  There  is  a  gap  of twelve years  between  447/6  and 435/4,  and  Berga  is  absent from  the  full  panel  of 443/2  (IG i\u00b3  269.ii.27\u00adiii.33).  The  gap may  be  connected  with  the  Athenian  venture  to  settle  1,000 colonists  in  Bisaltia  (Plut.  Per. 11.5;  cf.  Hammond  and Griffith ( 1979)  117).  Berga  paid  2,880  dr.  in  452/1  (IG i\u00b3 261.iv.29),  3,240  dr.  in  447/6  (IG i\u00b3  265.i.93)  and  3,120  dr. from  435/4  on  (IG i\u00b3  277.vi.30). In  the  new  inscription,  the  obscure  term  is  uncon- vincingly  interpreted  as  a  reference  to  a  council  (Bonias ( 2000)  231  line 3).  Berga  is  recorded  in  the  Epidaurian  list  of theorodokoi  of 359  (IG iv\u00b2.194.i.b.19).  The  name  of  the  theo- rodokos  was  Antiphanes,  who  may  be  identical  with  the author  whose  patris  was  Berge  according  to  Ps.-Skymnos ( 653\u00ad54)  (Isaac  ( 1986)  59). Berga  struck  silver  coins  in,  probably,  C 5s.  Types:  obv. kneeling  Silenos  carrying  a  nymph;  rev.  incuse  square;  leg- end:  some  have or on  obv.,  others  have on  rev.

Type:  A: .The toponym is   (IG iv\u00b2.194.32),  (Ephor. fr. 37),  or  once  (Theopomp.  fr. 43),  also  ,  (Ps.- Skylax 67;  Steph.  Byz. 221.3).  The  city-ethnic  is  exclusively attested  in  late  literary  sources  in  the  collective  and  external form  (Harp. 7;Strabo 7  fr. 36).  Datos  is  called  a  polis Hellenis  by  Ps.-Skylax 67  and  in  Harp. 7  quoting  Ephoros, where  we  cannot  be  sure  that  the  term  polis  stems  from Ephoros  (cf.  fr. 37). /  appears  to  have  been  the  name  both  of  the settlement  itself  and  of  the  surrounding  region  (Ephor.  fr. 37;  Suda 92).  Datos  was  proverbially  rich  in  fertile  lands, timber  and  gold  mines  (Harp  7;  Suda 92).It was inhabit- ed  by  Edonians  (Hdt. 9.75),  and  situated  near  the Strymonian  Gulf  (Strabo  7  fr. 33;  cf.  fr. 36).  The  region  has been  identified w ith  a  more  or  less  vast  area  including  the left  (east)  bank  of  the  lower  Strymon  below  Mt.  Pangaion, bordering  on  ancient  Lake  Prasias  and  extending  across  the Strymon\u00adAngites  confluence further eastward into the t er- ritory  of  the  Edonians,  probably  into  the  marshlands  of  the plain  of  Philippoi  (Collart  ( 1937)  133\u00ad37;  cf.  Hammond  and Griffith ( 1979)  72,  188;  Vatin  ( 1984)  265\u00ad68;  Borza  ( 1989) 63\u00ad65).  Antisara,  situated  on  the  Gulf  of  Kavala,  west  of Neapolis,  served  as  its  outlet  to  the  sea  (Steph.  Byz. 100.17:  ).  Herodotos  ( 9.75)  locates  in  the  region of  Datos  the  massacre  by  the  Edonians  of  the  Athenian  set- tlers  under  Leagros  and  Sophanes  in  465. thrace  from  strymon  to  nestos  859 Part  of  the  Datos  region  probably  became  the  territory of the  homonymous  urban  centre,  an  apoikia  founded  c. 360  by the  Thasians  (Diod. 16.3.7  (r 360/59);  cf.  Eust.  ad  Dion.  Perieg. 517  GGM  II 315.40\u00ad44)  under  the  exiled  Athenian Kallistratos  (Ps.-Skylax  67;  Isoc. 8.24;  Zenobios 4.34,where        shows  that  is  an obvious  emendation  of  MS  ).  In  360/59  Datos appointed  a  theorodokos  to  host  the  theoroi  of  Epidauros  (IG iv\u00b2.194.32). By  founding  the  colony  at  Datos,  Kallistratos  and  the Thasians  created  a  bridgehead  aimed  at  controlling  the whole  of  the  Datos  region,  which  is  identified w ith  the  \"Thasian  continent\"  of  the  coinage  minted  in  360. Recently  it  was  tentatively  proposed  to  identify  Datos  with the  fortified settlement on t op  of  Vassilaki  hill,  near  the  vil- lage  of  Amygdaleonas,  at  the  entrance  of  the  pass  leading from  the  plain  of  Philippoi  over  Mt.  Symbolon  to  Neapolis (Samartzidou  ( 1990)). Shortly  afterwards  Datos  was  conquered  by Philip  of Makedon  and  renamed  Philippoi  (Harp  7,quoting Ephor. fr. 37;  Philoch.  fr. 37).  Epigraphic  evidence  indicates  that Datos  and  its  territory  (or  at  least  part  of  it)  were  absorbed into  the  territory  of  Philippoi:  is mentioned in Alexander's  settlement  concerning  the  territory of  Philippoi (SEG 34  664.15;  Hatzopoulos  ( 1996)  ii.  no. 6),  and  the hypothesis  is  further  corroborated  by  the  plausible  identifi- cation  of  Timandros,  the  Epidaurian  theorodokos  in  Datos (IG iv\u00b2.194.32)  with  Timandros  the  father  of  five citizens of Philippoi  honoured  with  proxenia  in  a  Delphic  decree  of C 4s  (Syll. \u00b3267A.3;  cf.  Collart  ( 1937)  177\u00ad78).Thus,Datos  was incorporated  into  Philippoi,  and  it  is  this  reform  that  lies behind  the  information  in  several  sources  that  Datos  was renamed  Philippoi.  A  complete  equation  of  Datos  with Krenides-Philippoi,  as  indicated  at  App.  B  Civ. 4.13.105  (rC 4) and  accepted  by  Avramea  in  TIR 23\u00ad24,  is  plausibly  refuted by  Hammond  (Hammond  and  Griffith ( 1979)  187\u00ad88,  cf. 235).  According  to Vatin  (( 1984)  267\u00ad68),  Krenides  was  the name  of  a  locality  populated  by  Thracians  on  the  border  of the  region  called  Datos. 630.Eion  Map 51.  Lat. 40.45,long.  23.50.  Size  of  territory: probably  3.  Type:  A: ? The toponym is :',  (Hdt. 7.25.2;  Thuc. 4.102.3;  SEG 27  249  (C 5e);  IG i\u00b3  265.i.105).  The only  attestation  of  a  city-ethnic  is  at  Steph.  Byz. 298.22.Eion is  called  a  polis  in  the  urban  sense  by  Herodotos  ( 7.113.1), who  also  mentions  the  asty  and  its  defence  circuit  (teichos, 7.107.2),  whereas  Thucydides  calls  it  a  maritime  emporion of  the  Athenians  ( 4.102.3).  On  the  combined  evidence  of literary  and  numismatic  sources,  Hansen  argues  that  Eion was  not  simply  a  fortified emporion  (Isaac  ( 1986)  60\u00ad63;  cf. Papazoglou  ( 1988)  388)  but  indeed  a  (dependent)  polis  in  the political  sense  (Hansen  ( 2000)  197\u00ad98),  at  least  until  the foundation  of  Amphipolis. Eion  is  said  to  be  the  maritime  outlet  (limen)  of Amphipolis  (schol.  Thuc. 1.98.1).  Literary  sources  identify Eion  as  \u00b5  (Hdt. 7.25.2;  Thuc. 1.98.1)  and     \u00b5  (Dem. 23.199),  as  opposed  to  '    ,  the  homonymous  colony  of  Mende  in  the Chalkidike  (Thuc. 4.7;  see  no. 570).  Colonising  ventures  in the  area  of  Eion  by  the  Parians  (no  doubt  involving  the Parian  colonists  of  Thasos)  are  inferred  from  a  C 6l  epigram from  Amphipolis  (Lazaridis  ( 1976);  cf.  BE  ( 1978)  no. 297; SEG 27  249  ( 525\u00ad490))  combined  with  extensive  C 7\u00adC6 archaeological  remains  in  the  area.  Eion  is  recorded  as  a strongly  fortified supply base of  the  Persian  army in  C 5e (Hdt. 7.25.2),  heroically  defended  by its  governor  Boges against  the  Athenians  in  476/5  (Hdt. 7.107).  After  a  protract- ed  siege  by  the  Athenians  under  Kimon,  Eion  was  conquered and  exposed  to  andrapodismos  (Thuc. 1.98.1).  Its  capture raised  unprecedented  enthusiasm  in  Athens  (Plut.  Cim. 7\u00ad8; cf.  Perdrizet  ( 1910)  9\u00ad11),  which  reveals  the  strategic  impor- tance  attached  to  the  conquest.  Eion  became  an  emporion  of the  Athenians  and  was  used  as  a  base  for  their  penetration and  colonising  efforts  in  the  Strymon  valley  (Drabeskos: Thuc. 4.105;  cf.  schol.  Aeschin. 2.31),which  culminated  in  the foundation  of  Amphipolis  in  437/6  (Thuc. 4.102).  It became a  strongly  fortified naval base ( Thuc. 4.107.2),  and  in  447/6 Abdera  is  recorded  in  the  Athenian  tribute  lists  paying  1  tal- ent  to Eion  (IG i\u00b3  265.i.105).  In  the  Peloponnesian  War  it controlled  the  entrance  of  the  river,  especially  during  the siege  of  Amphipolis  in  424  and 422  (Thuc. 4.106\u00ad8,  5.6).  It was  probably  incorporated  into  the  territory of  Amphipolis (cf.  Theopomp.  fr. 51).  After  the  fall  of  Amphipolis  in  424, Brasidas'  attack  on  Eion  failed  (Thuc. 4.107.1\u00ad2),  and  Eion served  as  a  base  for  Kleon's  campaign  in  422  (Thuc. 5.6).The Athenians  in  Eion  were,  however,  forced  into  exile  after Aigos  potamoi  (schol.  in  Aeschin. 2.31).  At an  unspecified date,  Eion  was  razed  to  the  ground  by  the  Athenians,  and  its Amphipolitan  inhabitants  were  expelled  (Theopomp.  fr. 51; cf.  Jacoby  ad  loc. 364,  where  the  event  is  connected  with  the operations  of  Chares  against  Philip  II  in  357),  following which  Eion  does  not  appear  in  any  source,  either  historical or  geographical. According  to  Thuc. 4.102.3,  Eion  was  situated  on  the  estu- ary  of  the  river  Strymon, 25  stadia  (c. 30  stadia  according  to Diod. 12.73.3)  downstream  from  Amphipolis.  It was  usually 860 loukopoulou sought  at  the  mouth  (most  probably  on  the  left  bank)  of  the Strymon  (Collart  ( 1937)  73ff).  The  acropolis  of  Eion  was recently  identified on the P rophitis  Elias  hill,  with  surface finds dating from C 7  to C 5f  (Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1980a)  423)  and  C 6  cemetery  strata  (Koukouli- Chryssanthaki  and  Samartzidou  ( 1984)  276;  cf.  Pritchett ( 1965)  40  and  Papazoglou  ( 1988)  389.For  remains  of  the  pre- colonial  period,  see  Koukouli-Chryssanthaki  ( 1993) 684\u00ad85).  A  fragmentary  boundary  stone  of  \"Classical  date\" from  the  ruins  of  the  Byzantine  castle  of  Marmarion  is  ten- tatively  restored  as  indicating  the  presence  of  a  sanctuary  of Artemis  in  the  area  (Papang\u00e9los  ( 1990);  cf.  BE  ( 1991)  no. 414). A  number  of  C 5f  silver  and  electrum  coins  discovered  in the  area  have  been  attributed  to  Eion.  ( 1)  Electrum:  denom- inations:  hekte  and  fractions.  Type:  obv.  goose  with  or  with- out  lizard;  rev.  incuse  square.  ( 2)  Silver:  denominations: drachm  and  fractions  down  to  hemiobol.

The  toponym  is \u00b5,  (Thuc. 4.107.3;  Ant.  fr. 25,  Sauppe), \u00b5  in the  Delphic  list  of  theorodokoi  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iii.81),  ident- ified in Steph.  Byz. 487.8  with  Homeric  \u00b5  (Hom.  Il. 8.304).  Oisyme  is  said  to  have  been  renamed  '\u00b5  after Makedonian  Emathia  (Ps.-Skymnos  456\u00ad58;  Steph.  Byz. 487.8),  presumably  following  its  occupation  by  Philip  II. The  city-ethnic  is  \u00b5  (C 4  stamped  amphora  han- dles  (Bakalakis  ( 1938)  101\u00ad2;  cf.  Koukouli-Chryssanthaki ( 1969)).  Both  the  toponym  and  the  ethnic  are  epigraphical- ly  attested  in  C 3  (SGDI 2600;  BCH 45  ( 1921)  iii.81;  cf.  Robert ( 1940)  89  n. 4).  Oisyme  is  called  a  polis  by  Harpokration ( 12),  quoting  Ephoros  (fr. 36):      ,            '.  Here  Ephoros  is probably  quoted  for  the  site-classification,  since  Harp. quotes  Antiphon  for  the  toponym.  Polis  is  probably  used  in the  urban  sense  (see  Ant.  fr. 23,  Sauppe).  In  Ps.-Skylax  67, Oisyme  is  the  last  of  four  toponyms  listed  after  the  heading  ` ,  where polis  is  used  in  the  urban sense;  cf.  Ps.-Skymnos  656\u00ad57.For polis  used  in  the  political sense,  see  Diod. 12.68.4  (rC 5s).  The  collective  use  of  the  city- ethnic  is  attested  internally  on  stamped  handles  (supra)  and on  coins  (infra).  The  individual  and  external  use  is  attested in  a  C 3m  Delphic  proxeny  decree  (SGDI  II 2600). Oisyme  was  a  colony  (apoikia)  of  Thasos  (Thuc. 4.107.3; Diod. 12.68.4  (r 424)).  Qualified as a   `  and one  of  the  emporia  of  the  Thasians  by  Ps.-Skylax  67,it  is  clas- sified as both a dependent polis  and  an  emporion  in  the mainland  peraia  of  Thasos  (Hansen  ( 1997)  88,(2000)  199). Situated  in  Thrace  (Ephor.  fr. 36),  Oisyme  is  indeed  the only  city  of  the  Thasian  peraia  mentioned  in  Homer  (Il. 8.304).  Listed  in  the  C 3l  Delphic  list  of  theorodokoi  between Philippoi  and  Neapolis  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  III  81),it  is  located  by Armenidas  (apud  Athen. 1.31a),  together  with  Antisara,  in the    renowned  for  the  excellent  quality  of  its wine,  and  by  Ptolemy  on  the  coast  of  Edonis  (Ptol. 3.12.7). Oisyme  joined  Brasidas  after  his  capture  of  Amphipolis in 424,  following  the  example  of  Myrkinos  and  Galepsos (Thuc. 4.107.3).  Thereafter  and  during  C 4  her  fortune  seems to  have  followed  that  of  the  neighbouring  communities: Phagres,  Galepsos  and  Apollonia. Oisyme  was  securely--yet w ithout  definitive proof-- identified b y  Bakalakis  (( 1938)  97\u00ad102,  following  Heuzey and  Daumet  ( 1876)  and  Collart  ( 1937)  81\u00ad87)  with  the  forti- fied citadel on Cape V rasidas,  south  of  the  village  of  Nea Peramos,  in  the  southern  part  of  the  bay  of  Eleutherai (Leftero  Limani).  Excavations  undertaken  in  1938  and  again in 1964,  1968  and 1987\u00ad90  are  summarised  in  Giouri  and Koukouli  ( 1987);  cf.  Koukouli-Chryssanthaki  ( 1980b) 317\u00ad18;  Koukouli-Chryssanthaki  and  Papanikolaou  ( 1990). The  acropolis  wall  was  built  over  a  pre-colonial  stratum on  the  hill-top  (plans  in  Lazaridis  ( 1971)  figs. 66\u00ad67;  Giouri and  Koukouli  ( 1987)  366)  and  shows  two  distinct  phases (irregular  polygonal  and  rectangular  ashlar  local  granite masonry,  respectively);  in  C 5f,  a  second  wall  extended  the walled  area  to  the  north.  The  settled  area  spread  to  the south-east  flank of  the  hill,  towards  the  natural  harbour. The  cemetery  of  Oisyme,  excavated  in  the  sea-coast  sand- dunes  south  of  the  citadel,  testifies t o  the  existence  of  the  set- tlement  from  650  to 625  and  indicates  close  cultural relations  with  Thasos  and  its  mainland  colonies  (Giouri  and Koukouli  ( 1987)  365,  with  refs.).  Remains  of  a  monumental rectangular  C 5e  temple  excavated  at  the  top  of  the  acropolis hill  (plans  in  Giouri  and  Koukouli  ( 1987)  plans  2\u00ad3; Koukouli-Chryssanthaki  and  Papanikolaou  ( 1990)  488) were  found  to  succeed  an  older  temple  which  was  destroyed in  C 5e.  A  pre-colonial  stratum  was  identified under the Archaic  temple  (Koukouli-Chryssanthaki  ( 1987),  ( 1988)). Finds  in  the  destruction  layer  and  in  a  nearby  deposit include  roof  tiles,  decorated  terracotta  antefixes,  C 7s\u00adC5e pottery,  various  types  of  terracotta  female  figurines,  and fragments  of  large-size  C 6l  clay  kore-type  statues,  mostly relating  to  materials  from  Thasos.  Imported  ware  include C 7  and  C 6  Corinthian,  Attic,  Cycladic  and  East  Greek  pro- ductions.  The  excavators  attributed  the  sanctuary--mainly on  the  basis  of  the  figurine t ypes  and  of  bronze  shield  dedi- cations--to A thena  Polias,  referring  to  the  sanctuary  of  the 864 loukopoulou same  goddess  on  the  acropolis  of  Thasos,  which  also  suf- fered  destruction  in  C 5e  and  was  similarly  reconstructed  on a  larger  scale.  The  construction  of  the  C 5  temple  in  Oisyme is  considered  to  be  contemporary  with  the  restoration  and extension  of  the  defence  walls,  as  in  the  case  of  Thasos.  Its destruction  layer  abounds  in  C 2  pottery  (C 4\u00adC2  are  rep- resented  only  sparsely  in  surface  finds). Rare  C 4  bronze  coins  of  Oisyme  have  been  related  to  a short  period  of  civic  autonomy  (Picard  ( 1993);  cf.  ( 1994) 467).

Byz. 463.14). Myrkinos  was  an  Edonian  community  (Thuc. 4.107.3; Hdt. 5.126.2),  with  a  mixed  population  of  Greeks  and  bar- barians  (Hdt. 5.23.2).  It  was  colonised  and  fortified (Hdt. 5.23.1,  124.2)  c. 509  (Hammond  and  Griffith ( 1979)  68  n. 4)  by Histiaios,  the  tyrant  of  Miletos,  who  received  it  as  a  gift  from Dareios  (Hdt. 5.11,  124.2).  In  497  the  city  received  a  new  con- tingent  of  Greek  colonists  when  Aristagoras  fled M iletos with  a  group  of  Milesians  and  settled  in  Myrkinos  (Hdt. 5.124.2,126).Shortly  afterwards  he  and  his  army  were  massa- cred  by  the  Edonians  (Hdt. 5.126).  In  C 5s  Myrkinos  was ruled  by  the  king  of  the  Edonians,  Pittakos;  after  he  was murdered,  Myrkinos  fell  to  the  sons  of  Goaxis  and  his  wife Brauro,  and  following  the  fall  of  Amphipolis  in  424,  the Myrkinians  joined  Brasidas  and  provided  a  sizeable  contin- gent  of  cavalry  and  peltasts  ( 1,000  together  with  the Chalkidians)  and  cavalry  for  his  campaign  against  Kleon, who  was  actually  killed  by a  Myrkinian  peltast  (Thuc. 5.6.4 and 5.10.9). Myrkinos  was  situated  in  an  area  rich  in  gold,  silver  and timber  (Hdt. 5.23)  at  the  western  end  of  the  plain  of Philippoi,  near  Drabeskos  and  the  river  Strymon  (App.  B Civ. 4.105;Strabo 7  fr. 33);  but  the  precise  location  remains unidentified (Samsaris ( 1976)  141:  modern  Myrkinos (formerly  Doxambos);  more  probably ancient  site  near Palaiokomi  (formerly  Provista),  to the  north-west  of  Mt. Pangaion  (Papazoglou  ( 1988)  390\u00ad91;  cf.  Hammond  and Griffith ( 1979)  68;  TIR 42\u00ad43  s.v.). 634. ", "Philippoi": "Identifier: 7.109.2 , (Philippeus) Map  51.

Hatzopoulos  ( 1993)  322 with  n. 22).  Philippoi  is  not  called  a  polis  in  any  Classical source,  but  its  status  as  a  polis  is  strongly  indicated  by  its C 4m  coinage  combined  with  numerous  attestations  of  polis status  in  the  Hellenistic  period  (Rigsby  ( 1996)  no. 27.7,  9,  13, 15  ( 243/2);  Hatzopoulos  ( 1996)  ii.  no. 37.2  (C 2);  Artem.  fr. 15, GGM i576.7;  cf.  Hammond  and  Griffith ( 1979)  358\u00ad61).  The collective  form  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attested  internally  on coins  (infra)  and  in  inscriptions  (IG iv  617.21  (C 4l);  IG ii\u00b2 1956.149  (C 4l)).  For  the  individual  and  external  form,  see  IG vii  2433,  Thebes  (C 3\u00adC2). Founded  and  fortified b y  Philip  II  (Artem.  fr. 15),who  inter- vened  to  protect  Krenides  in  356  when  it  was  threatened  by  the Thracians  of  Kersebleptes  in  356,  Philippoi  is  recorded  as  hav- ing  replaced  Krenides  (Strabo  7  frr. 41  and 43;Diod.  16.3.7,  8.6; Artem.  fr. 15  (all  rC 4f))  or  Daton  (Ephor.  fr. 37;  Philoch.  fr. 44; cf.  App.  B  Civ. 4.13.105:  Krenides Daton Philippoi).  The identification of  Timandros  (the  theorodokos  of  the Epidaurian  theoroi  at  Daton  in  360/59  (IG iv\u00b2.194.32))  with the  father  of  five P hilippeis  appointed  proxenoi  of  Delphi  in  a C 4l  decree  (Syll. \u00b3267A;  cf.  Collart ( 1937)  177\u00ad78)  confirms the permanence  of  the  pre-Makedonian  population  (of  Thasian origin)  in  Philip's  new  foundation. Philippoi  is  listed  between  Amphipolis  and  Oisyme  in  the catalogue  of  Delphic  theorodokoi  (BCH 21  ( 1945)  iii.80).  It  is located  near  Mt.  Pangaion,  rich  in  gold  and  silver  mines,  on thrace  from  strymon  to  nestos  865 the  site  of  Krenides  (Strabo  7  fr. 34;  cf.  fr. 41);  it  is  also  said  to lie  near  Mt.  Symbolon,  which  extends  between  Neapolis  and Philippoi,  i.e.  in  the  plain  between  the  mountains  (Dio  Cass. 47.35.4).  According  to  App.  B  Civ. 4.105,  the  city  of  Philippoi covered--at least in R oman  times--the entire w idth  of  a steep  hill.  The  original  boundaries  of  Philippoi  remain unknown. A  boundary  settlement  concerning  Philippoi  dictated  by Alexander  III  (recently,  Hatzopoulos  ( 1996)  ii.  no. 6  Ager ( 1996)  no. 5)  and  dated  to  335  or 330  attests  not  only  to ambassadors  of  Philippoi  submitting  requests  to the Makedonian  king  (ii. 11,  as  restored  in  Ager),  but  also  to the king's  intervention  in  matters  of  boundary  disputes:  viz. exploitation  and  allocation  of  uncultivated  lands  and  dues thereon  ( i.4\u00ad6);  delimitation  and  re-establishment  of  the integrity  of  the  territory  ( i.8)  initially  donated  to  the  city  by its  founder  Philip  II  ( i.8\u00ad13),  which  had  apparently  been trespassed  upon  ( 8  and 12),  presumably  by  the  Thracians;  a special  provision  (exclusion  ?)  concerning  part  (more  than 2,000  plethra)  of  the  territory of  Daton  ( i.13\u00ad15);  the  meas- urement  and  addition  of  new  territory  ( ii.1\u00ad2);  the  confirm- ation  of  territorial  rights  of  Philippoi  as  opposed  to those  of the  Thracians  ( ii.2\u00ad5),  followed  by  a  summary  topographic delimitation,  presumably  of  the  new  borders  of  the  territory of  Philippoi  mentioning  hills  ( ii.7),  attributing  to  Philippoi the  land  around  the  territory  of  Sirra  ( ii.8)  and  including Daineros,  as  established  by  Philip  II  ( ii.8\u00ad10),  allocating  the marshes  to  Philippoi  as  far  as  \"the  bridge\"  ( ii.12\u00ad13),  and provisionally  forbidding  sales  of  forest  land  on  Mt.  Dysoron ( ii.10).  The  document  indicates  that  the  boundaries  of Philippoi  following  Alexander's  arbitration  (and  confirm- ing  Philip's  initial  settlement--as indeed in the R oman  peri- od  (Papazoglou  ( 1982)  99\u00ad102)--included only part of  the territory  to  the  west  and  north-west  (possibly  east  of  Mt. Menoikion),  allowing  the  Thracians  of  the  Strymon  valley to  remain  in  possession  of  at  least  part  of  their  lands. Attested  sales  transactions  from  Philippoi  include  the  sale of  sacred  lands  in  C 4s  (temene),  and  a  unique  testimony regarding  civic  taxation  is  inferred  from  the  mention  of  a  c. 2 per  cent  imposed  on  land  transactions.  The  docu- ments  also  record  several  deities  worshipped  in  C 4s Philippoi,  one  each  for  Ares,  Poseidon  and  the  Heroes,  two for  Philip--presumably Philip II,  being  the  object  of  heroic cult  as  the  ktistes  of  the  city  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1996)  ii.  no. 83;  cf. Ducrey ( 1988),  ( 1990)). The  constitution  of  pre-Roman  Philippoi  presents  all  the characteristics  of  a  Hellenistic  polis.  It  is  inferred  from,  espe- cially,  the  decree  of  asylia  for  Kos  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1996)  ii.  no. 36,  Kos  ( 243)  Rigsby  ( 1996)  no. 27),  that  the  original  con- stitution  remained  unchanged  during  C 4  and  most  of  C 3. The  documents  confirm the particular political status of Philippoi,  formally  founded  as  a--theoretically--inde- pendent  polis,  an  ally  of  the  Makedonians,  yet  institutional- ly  organised  on  the  Platonic  model  current  at  that  time (Hatzopoulos  ( 1996)  i. 158\u00ad60,  186\u00ad88).  Furthermore,  evid- ence  from  unpublished  hierokerykeia  sales  deeds  supports the  view  that  the  calendar  used  in  pre-Roman  Philippoi  was not  the  Makedonian,  but  \"an  original  calendar  with  names of  months  formed  on  the  names  of  the  Twelve  Gods,  just  as in  Cassadreia\",  another  Makedonian  foundation  with  close- ly  related  institutions  of  Platonic  inspiration  according  to Hatzopoulos  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1993)  322\u00ad23;  cf.  ( 1996)  i. 158\u00ad60).  Philippoi,  as  the  oldest  Makedonian  foundation, must  have  served  as  a  model  for  subsequent  foundations. The  political  status  and  institutions  of  the  pre-Roman  city were  recently  reconstructed  from  Hellenistic  epigraphic material  (Hatzopoulos  ( 1993);  cf.  Hatzopoulos  ( 1996)  i. passim). Philippoi  struck  coins  of  gold,  silver  and  bronze c. 356\u00ad330.

It  is  described  as  one  of  the  coastal    of  Thasos,  qualified as  `  and ,  situated  near  a  salt  lake  west  of  the  Nestos estuary,  on  the  route  traversed  by  Xerxes'  army  through southern  Thrace  in  480  (Hdt. 7.109\u00ad10). 866 loukopoulou Pistyros  has  tentatively  been  identified w ith  the  remains of  a  C 6l  fortified settlement east of  Pontolivado,  located near  the  Vassova  salt  lake.

The  city-ethnic  is   (Papakonstantinou-Diamantourou  ( 1971)  140  no. 223  (C 3); IG xii.8  206.8  (first c entury  ad))  or  (CIG 2007 (first c entury  ad)).  The  only  source  in  which  Sirra  is  called  a polis  is  Steph.  Byz. 572.16: ,   ,  quoting Book 20  of  Theopompos'  Philippika  (fr. 125);  but  it  is unknown  whether  Steph.  Byz.  found  the  site-classification in  Theopompos'  work  or  just  the  toponym. First  mentioned  in  Theopompos,  Sirra  is  located  in  the territory  of  the  Odomantes  according  to  Livy  45.4.2.Its  polis status  and  civic  institutions  are  epigraphically  attested  only for  the  Roman  period  (Papazoglou  ( 1988)  379\u00ad81). According  to  Hatzopoulos,  it  was  one  of  several  native  com- munities  expanded  with  immigrants  under  Philip  II  and extended  to  comprise  a  vast  territory  with  its  komai (Hatzopoulos  ( 1996)  i. 70).  For  the  participation  of  Sirra  in the  local  Pentapolis--probably also in the earlier local sym- politeia--see  supra 857/859,  Gasoros,  and  Berga  (no. 628). The  territory of  Sirra  (    )  is  mentioned  in  the settlement  of Alexander  III  concerning  Philippoi (Hatzopoulos  ( 1996)  ii.  no. 6,l.8  ( 330)).  It  was,  together  with the  otherwise  unknown  Daineros,  the  northern  limit  of  the territory  granted  to  the  city  of  Philippoi  by  Philip  II. Sirra  survives  with  its  name  virtually  unchanged  from Antiquity  through  the  Middle  Ages  to  the  present  day (Serres).  On  the  precise  location  of  ancient  Sirra  on  the Koulas  hill  dominating  the  modern  city  from  the  north,  and the  sparse  ancient  remains,  see  Bakalakis  ( 1957)  and  Samsaris ( 1976)  128,  with  references.  Some  commentators  (How and Wells  ( 1928)  ii. 274)  have  improbably  identified  with     in  Hdt. 8.115.3;  cf.  Steph.

The city-ethnic  is  (IG i\u00b3  101.2)  or   (F.Delphes iii.4414.13  (C 3f))  and  is  often  geographically specified:  '   (IG i\u00b3  278.v.14\u00ad15) or        (IG i\u00b3  101.32  and 48).  The second  part  of  the  compound  toponym  testifies t o  the  polis status  of  Neapolis.  In  Ps.-Skylax  67  Neapolis  is  one  of  the toponyms  listed  after  the  heading   ` , where polis  is  used  in  the  urban  sense;  and  in  the  so-called Charter  of  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League  Neapolis appears  under  the  heading    \u00b5\u00b5  (IG ii\u00b2 43.78  and  B. 34).The  collective  use  of  the  city-ethnic  is  attest- ed  internally  on  coins  (infra)  and  externally  in  the  Athenian decrees  and  tribute  lists  (supra).  The  individual  and  external use  is  attested  in  a  Thasian  inscription  of  C 5l  (IG xii.8 263.12\u00ad13). Neapolis  was  situated  at  the  northernmost  limit  of  the Strymonic  Gulf,  near  the  coast  of  the  Datenoi  (Strabo  7  frr. 32  and 36)  not  far  from  Daton  itself  (Ps.-Skylax  67).  It  is  the last  city  attested  by  Ps.-Skylax  67  west  of  the  river  Nestos;  in the  list  of  the  Epidaurian  theorodokoi  it  is  recorded  before Abdera and  after  Mende  (IG iv\u00b2.194.27),  in  the  Delphic  list 862 loukopoulou of  theorodokoi  after  Philippoi  and  Oisyme  but  before [ ]  (BCH 45  ( 1921)  iii.82).  According  to  Cassius  Dio ( 47.35.3)  it  was  located  on  the  coast  opposite  Thasos,  separ- ated  from  the  plain  of  Philippoi  by  Mt.  Symbolon.  The  port of  Neapolis  is  mentioned  in  an  Athenian  decree  of 409  (IG i\u00b3 101.28;  Lazaridis  ( 1969)  20  and 23).  The  proposed  identifica- tion  with  Kavala  (Heuzey  and  Daumet  ( 1876)  18\u00ad20;  cf. Collart  ( 1937)  105\u00ad6)  was  archaeologically  confirmed b y  the discovery  of  segments  of  polygonal  fortification walls of  a Classical  citadel  on  the  Pharos  peninsula  (plan  in  Lazaridis ( 1971)  fig. 69). The  disputed  origin  of  Neapolis  from  either  Thasos  or Athens  or  Eretria  (Collart  ( 1937)  112\u00ad24)  was  settled  by Pouilloux  (( 1954)  158ff),  who  emphasised  the  decisive  argument  provided  by  the  archaeological  material: Thasian\u00adParian  lettering  in  C 6  graffiti and standard Thasian  types  of  early  Neapolis  coinage  (Kraay  ( 1976) 150\u00ad51).  It  is  notable  that  in  411\u00ad409,  at  the  request  of  the Neopolitans,  Athens  erased  the  express  reference  to Neapolis  being  a  colony  of  Thasos  from  the  first of  two  hon- orific decrees ( IG i\u00b3  101.7,  8  (rasurae),  cf. 68\u00ad69). Neapolis  was  a  member  of  the  Delian  League.  It  belonged to  the  Thracian  district  and  was  entered  on  the  Athenian tribute  lists  first b y toponym  (IG i\u00b3  259.vi.9\u00ad10)  but  from 443/2  by  city-ethnic  (IG i\u00b3  269.ii.28).  It  is  recorded  in  the tribute  lists  from  454/3  (IG i\u00b3  259.vi.9\u00ad10)  to  429/8  (IG i\u00b3 282.ii.19\u00ad20)  a  total  of  fourteen  times,  once  completely restored,  and  paid  in  all  years  1,000  dr.  (IG i\u00b3  265.i.20). A  further  proof  of  its  continued  independence  of  Thasian control  is  inferred  from  the  fact  that  it  had  control  over  cus- toms  dues  collected  in  its  own  harbour  (IG i\u00b3  101.27\u00ad30; Isaac  ( 1986)  67).  Thus  the  fact  that  some  Neopolitans  possessed  property  in  Thasos,  which  was  confiscated b y  the oligarchic  government  of  that  island  in  411  (IG xii.8263.5\u00ad7, 12\u00ad13),  reflects most probably the survival of  a  situation  dat- ing  from  before  463,  when  Neapolis,  with  the  rest  of  the Thasian  peraia,  was  detached  from  the  territory  of  Thasos. Following  the  defection  of  Thasos  from  the  Athenian League  in  411,  Neapolis  remained  loyal  to  Athens,  causing Neopolitan  oligarchs  to  take  refuge  in  Thasos,  while  the property  of  Neopolitan  democrats  in  Thasos  was  confiscat- ed  (IG xii.8263;  cf.  the  admission  into  the  citizen  body  of Thasos  of  presumed  Neopolitan  refugees  born  of  Thasian mothers  (IG xii.8264  (c. 408\u00ad404);  cf.  Wilhelm  ( 1911\u00ad32)  ii ( 1914)  no. 14;  Collart  ( 1937)  129\u00ad30).Unsuccessfully  besieged by  the  Thasians,  the  Neopolitans  were  praised  by  the Athenians  for  their  loyalty  and  for  participating  in  the  siege of  Thasos  by  Thrasyboulos  (IG i\u00b3  101  ( 410/9)). A  problematic  inscription  from  Paros  (IG xii.5109 (C 5l\u00adC4e)),  usually  considered  as  a  treaty  between  Thasian oligarchs  and  Paros  with  the  participation  of  Neopolitan refugees  (       ),  has  been  interpret- ed  as  a  peace  treaty  between  Thasians  and  Neopolitans organised  by  Paros  (Pouilloux  ( 1954)  178\u00ad92;  cf.  IG xii.8264, from  Thasos  and  the  fragmentary  treaty  of  reconciliation between  Thasos  and  Neapolis  in  390  recently  discovered  in Delphi:  Moretti  ( 1987)  with  refs.). Having  preserved  its  independence  from  Thasos  in  the aftermath  of  the  Peloponnesian  War,  Neapolis  became  a member  of  the  Second  Athenian  Naval  League  in  375/4  (IG ii\u00b2  43B.34).  This  independent  status  seems  to  have  been  pre- served  even  after  the  expansion  of  the  peraia  of  Thasos  in  the plain  of  Daton  in  360/59,  obliging  Thasos  to  seek  an  alterna- tive  outlet  to  the  sea  for  the  produce  of  her  new  possessions: it  may  account  for  the  record  of  Antisara  as  a  port  of  the Datenoi  in  Steph.  Byz.  ( 100.17).  In the  spring  of 355  Neapolis sent  ambassadors  to Athens  to negotiate  the  conclusion  of an  alliance  with  Athens,  presumably  against  Philip  II  of Makedon (IG ii\u00b2  128).  The  termination  of  the  Neopolitan coinage  around  the  same  period  indicates  the  final annexa- tion  of  Neapolis  to the  Makedonian  kingdom.  C 3  epigraph- ic  testimony  from  Delphi  (F.Delphes iii.4414.13)  and  the  fact that  Neapolis  hosted  theoroi  of  Delphi  in  C 3l  (BCH 45  ( 1921) iii.82)  indicate  that  its  civic  status  remained  unchanged after  the  foundation  of  Philippoi;  cf.  Papazoglou  ( 1988)  403. The  poliad  deity  of  Neapolis  was  Athena  Parthenos,  as confirmed b y  epigraphic  and  figurative t estimonies (Bakalakis  ( 1936a)  33  nos. 1  and 2).  The  relief  crowning  a C 4m  Athenian  decree  in  favour  of  the  Neopolitans  repre- sents  Athena  and  a  polos-wearing  goddess,  identified b y  the legend (IG ii\u00b2  128;  Lawton  ( 1995)  no. 28), and  Parthenos  is  presumed  to  be  represented  in  the  relief crowning  the  C 5l  decree  as  well  (IG i\u00b3  101;  Lawton  ( 1995)  no. 7).  Her  sanctuary,  attested  in  IG i\u00b3  101.45,  57  and 63  (cf.  Tod 84),  was  identified on decisive epigraphic e vidence  with  the archaeological  remains  of  a  monumental  C 6  temple  (Ionic capitals  and  fragments  of  entablature)  discovered  inside  the citadel,  on  the  Pharos  peninsula  in  Kavala,  presumed  to  have replaced  an  earlier  wooden  construction.  The  earliest  pot- tery  finds in the sanctuary w ere  dated  to  c. 650\u00ad625 (Lazaridis  ( 1961\u00ad62)  235\u00ad6),  while  a  rich  Archaic  deposit yielded  Thasian,  Corinthian  and  East  Greek  ware  ( 625\u00ad600) and  C 6m  Attic  black-figure (Lazaridis ( 1961\u00ad62);  for  proba- ble  pre-colonial  pottery,  cf.  Koukouli-Chryssanthaki  ( 1993) 686\u00ad87).Moreover,a  cult  of  Artemis  with  the  epithet  Opitais is  epigraphically  attested  (Lazaridis  ( 1941\u00ad42)).  Some  thrace  from  strymon  to  nestos  863 further  information  concerning  religious  institutions  in Neapolis  is  preserved  in  a  C 4(?)  inscription  mentioning  a neokoros  of  the  Parthenos  and  the  existence  of  a  kreophy- lakion  (  archives;  Collart  ( 1937)  108\u00ad9). Neapolis  struck  silver  coins  from  c. 530  to  the  Makedonian conquest  in  C 4m,  and  bronze  in  C 4s.
